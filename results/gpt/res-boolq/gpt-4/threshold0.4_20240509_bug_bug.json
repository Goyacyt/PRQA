[{"test case number": 9, "context": " (500 Days of Summer) The style of film is presented in a nonlinear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film was based on a real romance. Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the London School of Economics in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell ``crazily, madly, hopelessly in love'' with the girl who ``returned his kisses but not his ardor.'' The ending of the relationship was ``painfully and unforgettably awful,'' which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, ``we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt that the only way to tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy''.", "modContext": " (500 Days of Summer) The style of film is presented in a nonlinear narrative.", "question": "is 500 days of summer based on a true story?", "groundTruth": "american football conference", "answer": "yes, \"500 days of summer\" is based on a real romance experienced by co-writer scott neustadter", "modAnswer": "the context does not provide information on whether \"500 days of summer\" is based on a true story", "delete sentence number": [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], "distance value": [[0, 0.28257234767079353], [1, 0.1632257318124175], [6, 0.14597753109410405], [5, 0.139497309923172], [7, 0.11122544668614864], [2, 0.08455691114068031], [3, 0.07710292376577854], [4, 0.056194255128502846], [8, 0.010523475706577301]]}, {"test case number": 12, "context": " (Gone with the Wind (film)) The film received positive reviews upon its release, in December 1939, although some reviewers found it overlong.
