He was born in Woodland Plantation near La Place , Louisiana .   Biography   Ory started playing music with home-made instruments in his childhood , and by his teens was leading a well-regarded band in Southeast Louisiana . He kept La Place , Louisiana , as his base of operations due to family obligations until his twenty-first birthday , when he moved his band to New Orleans , Louisiana . He was one of the most influential trombonists of early jazz .   Ory was a banjo player during his youth and it is said that his ability to play the banjo helped him develop `` tailgate '' , a particular style of playing the trombone . In `` tailgate '' style the trombone plays a rhythmic line underneath the trumpets and cornets .   While Ory was living on Jackson Avenue , he was discovered by Buddy Bolden , playing his first New trombone , instead of the old civil war trombone . But his sister said he was too young to play with Bolden .   Ory had one of the best-known bands in New Orleans in the 1910s , hiring many of the great jazz musicians of the city , including cornetists Joe `` King '' Oliver , Mutt Carey , and Louis Armstrong , who joined the band in 1919 ; and clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone .   In 1919 he moved to Los Angeles\u2014one of a number of New Orleans musicians to do so near that time\u2014and he recorded there in 1921 with a band that included Mutt Carey , clarinetist and pianist Dink Johnson , and string bassist Ed Garland . Garland and Carey were longtime associates who would still be playing with Ory during his 1940s comeback . While in Los Angeles Ory and his band recorded two instrumentals , `` Ory 's Creole Trombone '' and `` Society Blues '' , as well as a number of songs . They were the first jazz recordings made on the west coast by an African-American jazz band from New Orleans . His band recorded with the recording company Nordskog and Ory paid them for the pressings and then sold them under his own label of `` Kid Ory 's Sunshine Orchestra '' at a store in Los Angeles called Spikes Brothers Music Store . In 1925 , Ory moved to Chicago , where he was very active , working and recording with Louis Armstrong , Jelly Roll Morton , Oliver , Johnny Dodds , Bessie Smith , Ma Rainey , and many others . He mentored Benny Goodman , and later Charles Mingus .   During the Great Depression Ory retired from music and did not play again until 1943 . From 1944 to about 1961 he led one of the top New Orleans style bands of the period . In addition to Mutt Carey and Ed Garland , trumpeters Alvin Alcorn and Teddy Buckner ; clarinetists Darnell Howard , Jimmie Noone , Albert Nicholas , Barney Bigard , and George Probert ; pianists Buster Wilson , Cedric Haywood , and Don Ewell ; and drummer Minor Hall were among his sidemen during this period . All but Probert , Buckner , and Ewell were originally from New Orleans .   The Ory band was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz , making popular 1940s radio broadcasts\u2014among them a number of slots on The Orson Welles Almanac program ( beginning March 15 , 1944 ) . In 1944\u201345 the group made a series of recordings on the Crescent Records label , founded by Nesuhi Ertegun for the express purpose of recording Ory 's band .   During the late 1940s and early 1950s , Ory and his group appeared at the Beverly Cavern in Los Angeles .   Ory retired from music in 1966 and spent his last years in Hawaii , with the assistance of Trummy Young . Ory died in Honolulu . He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City , California .

All have been released on DVD in the U.K. , while only the first series has been released in North America .   This show should not be confused with the short lived 1979 Quackula which was produced by Filmation and appeared as part of their Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle cartoon hour .   History   Count Duckula was created by British studio Cosgrove Hall as a spin-off from Danger Mouse . In 1984 Nickelodeon acquired the rights to Danger Mouse which became a hit for the channel . After a few years the Nickelodeon management came to Cosgrove Hall wishing to co-produce a new series . After being shown a number of ideas , the then head of Nickelodeon , Jenny Lebron , spotted a picture of Count Duckula in Brian Cosgrove 's office , and said `` that 's the one I want '' . As the series went into production one of the writers suggested he become a vegetarian , which added an even sillier concept to the series .   Spin-offs   In a move mirroring Duckula 's adaptation from Danger Mouse , the characters of Gaston and Pierre were reinvented and given a spinoff series as the now-human Victor and Hugo .   Count Duckula appeared in North American comics under Star Comics ( an imprint of Marvel Comics ) and introduced an additional difference between this incarnation of Duckula which separated him from his predecessors . Due to ketchup being used in the resurrection ceremony , this version of Duckula has ketchup , rather than blood , flowing through his veins . This was discovered when Duckula was given a blood test in order to get a passport into a fictional country which produced a salad which Duckula was obsessed with getting to eat . In the same issue , Duckula , Nanny , and Igor were photographed as a means of formal ID for said country , however due to the classic stereotype of vampires not appearing in film , Duckula did not appear in the photo which was taken . Duckula would also gain a romantic interest in the Star Comics run ; Vanna Von Goosewing , who turned out to be the niece of his long time adversary Dr . Von Goosewing . The attraction was mutual , and the two continued their relationship though the majority of the series after their introduction , though Vanna did n't always appear in every issue of the book .   Plot   Several episodes explore the theme that each resurrection creates a new incarnation with little to no memory of its past life , the immediate past incarnation referred to as the current 's `` father '' . Thus , every incarnation is free to develop its own personality and pursue its own personal interests . The vampire is able to pose as a `` dreadful dynasty , the counts of Duckula '' . The preceding generations included knights , sorcerers , scientists , artists , Egyptologists and even professional gamblers , all of whom are also secretly `` vicious vampire ducks '' .   However , as the title sequence puts it , `` the latest reincarnation did not run according to plan '' . The successful conclusion of the ritual requires blood ( a send-up of the Hammer Dracula films ) , the source of sustenance for any vampire , but Nanny accidentally substitutes tomato ketchup . Consequently , the newest version is not a blood-sucking vampire , but a vegetarian one . He is more interested in juicy carrots than hunting for victims . Igor is appalled . Even worse , his `` new '' master is obsessed with pursuing wealth and fame as an entertainer .   The stories often centre around Duckula 's adventures in search of riches and fame , assisted by the castle 's ability to teleport around the world . Another regularly occurring theme is the repeated attempt by Igor to turn Duckula into a proper vampire .

However, Nanny mistakenly uses tomato ketchup instead.As a result, the latest model is not based on vampires that consume blood, but rather vegetarians.He prioritizes savoring juicy carrots over seeking out victims.Igor is displeased.The new master of the family is obsessed with becoming an entertainer and achieving fame and wealth, which is even more concerning.The stories often revolve around Duckula's quest to achieve fame and wealth, with the castle being able to teleport worldwide.Igor's repeated efforts to transform Duckula into a genuine vampire are another common theme.Doctor Von Goosewing, who is based on Dr., serves as Duckula's adversary in certain episodes.Abraham Van Helsing, the antagonist of Dracula, is a vampire hunter who refuses to accept the current version of Duckula as harmless.", "question": "who voiced count duckula in an animated 1980's and 1990's television series of the same name?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "David Jason", "modAnswer": "David Jason voiced Count Duckula in the animated television series.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[0, 0.6949466466903687], [13, 0.6820212006568909], [33, 0.5933220386505127], [16, 0.5402493476867676], [7, 0.5379868745803833], [17, 0.4875483512878418], [10, 0.47897011041641235], [1, 0.45339739322662354], [15, 0.4285837709903717], [23, 0.4243967533111572], [12, 0.42253565788269043], [31, 0.4155004322528839], [32, 0.4097669720649719], [19, 0.4092627167701721], [6, 0.39570993185043335], [14, 0.3828905522823334], [18, 0.3705628514289856], [34, 0.3512899875640869], [24, 0.2165379822254181], [8, 0.20495101809501648], [26, 0.18814265727996826], [9, 0.16804426908493042], [21, 0.15611225366592407], [11, 0.15570421516895294], [27, 0.13821592926979065], [20, 0.1379828006029129], [3, 0.1175147145986557], [2, 0.11736895143985748], [25, 0.1046861857175827], [5, 0.10107067227363586], [29, 0.0958455353975296], [4, 0.08267652988433838], [28, 0.02791448123753071], [30, -0.006407436914741993], [22, -0.007982917129993439]]}, {"test case number": 2, "context": "The Beatles appeared in five motion pictures , most of which were very well received .

The roots of Dada lay in pre-war avant-garde . Cubism and the development of collage , combined with Wassily Kandinsky 's theoretical writings and abstraction , detached the movement from the constraints of reality and convention . The influence of French poets and the writings of German Expressionists liberated Dada from the tight correlation between words and meaning .

They had seen ( or participated in ) Cubist exhibitions held at Galer\u00eda Dalmau , Barcelona ( 1912 ) , Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin ( 1912 ) , the Armory show in New York ( 1913 ) , SVU M\u00e1nes in Prague ( 1914 ) , several Jack of Diamonds exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring , Amsterdam ( between 1911 and 1915 ) . Futurism developed in response to the work of various artists . Dada subsequently combined these approaches .   Dada activities included public gatherings , demonstrations , and publication of art/literary journals ; passionate coverage of art , politics , and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media . Key figures in the movement included Hugo Ball , Emmy Hennings , Hans Arp , Raoul Hausmann , Hannah H\u00f6ch , Johannes Baader , Tristan Tzara , Francis Picabia , Richard Huelsenbeck , George Grosz , John Heartfield , Marcel Duchamp , Beatrice Wood , Kurt Schwitters , Hans Richter , and Max Ernst , among others . The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements , and groups including surrealism , Nouveau R\u00e9alisme , pop art and Fluxus .   Overview   Dada was an informal international movement , with participants in Europe and North America . The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I . For many participants , the movement was a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests , which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war , and against the cultural and intellectual conformity\u2014in art and more broadly in society\u2014that corresponded to the war .   Many Dadaists believed that the 'reason ' and 'logic ' of bourgeois capitalist society had led people into war . They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace chaos and irrationality . For example , George Grosz later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest `` against this world of mutual destruction . ''   According to Hans Richter Dada was not art : it was `` anti-art . '' Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for . Where art was concerned with traditional aesthetics , Dada ignored aesthetics . If art was to appeal to sensibilities , Dada was intended to offend .   As Hugo Ball expressed it , `` For us , art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in . ''   A reviewer from the American Art News stated at the time that `` Dada philosophy is the sickest , most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man . '' Art historians have described Dada as being , in large part , a `` reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide . ''   Years later , Dada artists described the movement as `` a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis , a savior , a monster , which would lay waste to everything in its path ... [ It was ] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization ... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege .

in 1916 at Cabaret Voltaire and quickly spread to Berlin, but reached its zenith in New York City in 1915.In 1913, Marcel Duchamp introduced the term anti-art, which was a precursor to Dada, when he created his first readymades.Dada was not only against war but also against the bourgeoisie and had political connections with the radical left.Ubu Roi by Alfred Jarry and the ballet Parade by Erik Satie, both of which were considered pre-Dadaist works, had already enlightened audiences and artists.The roots of Dada can be found in the avant-garde movement that existed before the wars.Through the use of Cubism, collage, and Wassily Kandinsky's theoretical writings and abstraction, the movement broke away from the constraints of reality and convention.The writings of German Expressionists and the influence of French poets liberated Dada from the tight bond between words and meaning.The avant-garde outside of France was aware of the changes that occurred in Paris before the war.The Cubist exhibitions that they were present at included Galera Dalmau, Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin, Armory in New York, SVU M\u00e1nes in Prague, Jack of Diamonds in Moscow, and De Moderne Kunstkring in Amsterdam from 1911 to 1915.The work of multiple artists sparked the development of Futurism.Later on, Dada integrated these techniques.Dada activities encompassed public events, demonstrations, and the publication of art and literary journals;Art, politics, and culture were frequently the focus of passionate coverage in various media outlets.Hugo Ball, Emmy Hennings, Hans Arp, Raoul Hausmann, Hannah H\u00f6ch, Johannes Baader, Tristan Tzara, Francis Picabia, Richard Huelsenbeck, George Grosz, John Heartfield, Marcel Duchamp, Beatrice Wood, Kurt Schwitters, and Hans Richter were among the key figures in the movement.The movement had an impact on later styles, including avant-garde and downtown music, as well as surrealism, Nouveau R\u00e9alisme, pop art, and Fluxus.An informal global movement, Dada Overview, had participants in Europe and North America.The inception of Dada coincides with the start of World War I.The movement was viewed by many participants as a means of protesting against the cultural and intellectual norms that were associated with the war, as well as the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist ideals.The belief that bourgeois capitalist society's rationality and logic caused people to engage in war was held by many Dadaists.They expressed their rejection of that ideology through artistic expression that seemed to reject logic and instead embrace chaos and irrationality.George Grosz remembered that his Dadaist artwork was intended to be a form of protest against the world of mutual destruction.\"According to Hans Richter Dada, this was

One team , designated the batting team , attempts to score as many runs as possible , whilst their opponents field . Each phase of play is called an innings . After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a set number of overs have been completed , the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles . The winning team is the one that scores the most runs , including any extras gained , during their period batting .   At the start of each game , two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play . The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team , known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , towards a set of wooden stumps , in front of which stands one of the batsmen , known as the striker . The striker 's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat , and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs . The other batsman , known as the non-striker , waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler . The bowler 's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman , at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease .   The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball , leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat , and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground . Runs are scored through two main methods : either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary , or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball . If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground , a run-out occurs . Adjudication is performed on-field by two umpires .   The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) and Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs , to Test cricket , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece . Traditionally , cricketers play in all-white kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard , solid object made of compressed leather enclosing a cork core .   Although cricket 's origins are uncertain , it is first recorded in south-east England in the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the mid-19th century . ICC , the game 's governing body , has over 100 members , ten of which are full members who play Test cricket . Women 's cricket , which is organised and played separately , has also achieved international standard .

Etymology   A number of words have been suggested as sources for the term `` cricket '' . In the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598 it is called creckett . One possible source for the name is the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.Birley , p. 3 . In Samuel Johnson 's Dictionary , he derived cricket from `` cryce , Saxon , a stick '' .

The pitch in the center is rectangular and 22 yards long, with a wicket and three wooden stumps placed at each end for safety.The batting team endeavors to score as many runs as possible while competing against their opponents.The term \"innings\" is used to denote every stage of the game.When either ten batsmen are dismissed or a specific number of overs have been played, the innings concludes and the two teams switch sides.The team that scores the most runs, including any extras, during their innings is known as the winning team.The field of play is always occupied by eleven fielders and two batsmen at the beginning of each game.At the start of the game, the ball is delivered by the bowler from the fielding team to a set of wooden stumps, with the batsman being placed in front of it.The striker's task is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps and score runs by striking it well.The non-striker batsman waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler.The bowler's objective is to prevent runs and then discard the batsman, resulting in his departure from the field while another player takes over at the crease.The most common types of dismissal are bowled, which involves the bowler hitting the stumps with their legs and wicket, caught, or batting.The scoring of runs can be achieved through either striking the ball with enough force to cross the boundary or having the batsmen run in opposite directions while the fielders are retrieving the pitch.The wicket can be left out of reach by either batsman, resulting in a run-out as the fielder retrieves the ball quickly.On-field adjudication is carried out by two umpires.The ICC and MCC are responsible for upholding the rules of cricket.The formats available include Twenty20, which involves each team playing a single 20-overs innings, and Test cricket, where teams play two innings each over five days with unlimited overs.In the past, cricketers have traditionally donned white uniforms, but in limited overs matches, they opt for their team or club colours.In addition to their basic equipment, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury from the ball, which is made of cork and compressed leather.The origins of cricket are uncertain, but it was first recorded in south-east England during the 16th century.With the expansion of the British Empire, it became a global phenomenon and there were initial international matches in the mid-19th century.The ICC, the game's governing body, has a total of 100-members, including 10 full members who are Test cricketers.The international standard for women's cricket, played separately and in an organised manner, has been established.The world's second most popular spectator sport is cricket, which is predominantly played in Australasia, Great Britain and Ireland (GBI), the Indian subcontinent, southern Africa, and the West Indies.The origin of the word  cricket '' has been suggested through various sources.Creckett is the name given to the sport that was mentioned for the first time in 1598.The name of the item may have been derived from the Old English words cricc or cryce, which means crutch or staff.Birley's writing is located on the page.Three.The term \"cricket\" in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary was derived from the words \"cryce\", \"Saxon,\" and \"stick.\"In the Old French, the word criquet appears to mean club or stick.", "question": "which australian cricketer in his very last innings in 1948 scored a duck (0)?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "Don Bradman.", "modAnswer": "Don Bradman.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[8, 0.5049527883529663], [0, 0.47488194704055786], [6, 0.4629631042480469], [10, 0.43515169620513916], [12, 0.4231853783130646], [22, 0.4142252504825592], [7, 0.41386693716049194], [9, 0.4118363857269287], [4, 0.3994099199771881], [3, 0.39772576093673706], [28, 0.3909434676170349], [5, 0.37492722272872925], [16, 0.3688086271286011], [23, 0.3533313572406769], [1, 0.3514455556869507], [11, 0.3361701965332031], [18, 0.3325161933898926], [15, 0.33191007375717163], [14, 0.32745808362960815], [20, 0.30613839626312256], [2, 0.24539507925510406], [27, 0.2429579794406891], [21, 0.22835110127925873], [13, 0.21760445833206177], [26, 0.2112066000699997], [24, 0.21113483607769012], [17, 0.1888578087091446], [25, 0.15905949473381042], [19, 0.14211010932922363], [29, 0.12395936250686646]]}, {"test case number": 5, "context": "The Communist Party of Peru ( Spanish : Partido Comunista del Per\u00fa ) , more commonly known as the Shining Path ( Sendero Luminoso ) , is a radical organization in Peru .

Historically several cities have been considered the `` second city of the British Empire '' , both Glasgow and Liverpool were burgeoning major industrial cities throughout the 19th century with competing claims to be the busiest ports in the world for ship building and freight transport , Calcutta also laid the claim from as far away as India as the most populous city while in 1911 the editor of the Irish Times laid a claim for Dublin during a ceremonial visit by George V. Since the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1949 several cities have made claims to be the `` second city of the Commonwealth '' ( often with particular reference to the significance of the Commonwealth Games ) in particular Manchester in 2000 and Glasgow again in 2012 .   In contrast throughout much of the 20th and 21st Century Birmingham has generally been regarded as the second city of the United Kingdom in terms of populace and GDP while Edinburgh has been promoted as the second city by virtue as the capital of Scotland . Less authoratitive claims have been made on behalf of Cardiff & Belfast due to their status as the respective capital cities of Wales & Northern Ireland .   History   Since the formation of the United Kingdom , several places have been described as the `` second city '' . Dublin was the second most populous city at the time of the formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801 , though it lost that position later in the 19th century as other cities grew through more rapid industrialisation . As such , it was often described as the second city of the UK . Dublin , and the rest of the Republic of Ireland , became independent of the UK in the 1920s .   The title Second City of Empire or Second City of the British Empire was claimed by a number of cities in the 18th , 19th and early 20th centuries . Commercial trading city Liverpool was regarded as holding this title with its massive port , merchant fleet and world-wide trading links . [ http : //www.nottingham.ac.uk/home/ahzsh1/Empire/Project.htm Untitled Document ] Liverpool was constantly referred to as the New York of Europe . Others included Dublin , Glasgow ( which continues to use the title as a marketing slogan ) , and ( outside the UK ) Calcutta and Philadelphia .   Prior to the union with Scotland in 1707 , from the English Civil War until the 18th century , Norwich was the second-largest city of England , being a major trading centre , Britain 's richest provincial city and county town of Norfolk , at that time the most populous county of England . Bristol was the second wealthiest city in England in the 16th century ; and by the 18th century , Bristol was often described as the second city of England . During the 19th century , claims were made for Manchester , Liverpool and York . York had also been named as the second city in earlier centuries .   By the early 19th century , Glasgow was frequently referred to as the second city ; and during much of the 20th century it had a population of over one million , larger than that of Birmingham until the 1951 census . For example , the Official Census population for Glasgow was 0.784 million in April 1911 ; 1.034 million in April 1921 ; 1.088 million in April 1931 and 1.090 million in April 1951 . However , slum clearances in the 1960s led to displacement of residents from the city centre to new communities located outside the city boundaries . This , together with local government reorganisation , resulted in the official population of Glasgow falling sharply . The Glasgow City Council area currently has a population of 600,000 although the surrounding conurbation of Greater Glasgow has a population of 1,199,629 . In contrast , the population of the city of Birmingham has remained steady around the one million mark ; its central population fell like Glasgow 's , but the city boundaries were extended several times in the early 20th century .

people, the Glasgow City Council area is currently home to only 1,199,629 residents in the Greater Glasgow conurbation.In comparison to other cities, Birmingham's population has remained roughly at

The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth ( the Coriolis effect ) .   Former changes in the sea levels have left continental shelves , shallow areas in the sea close to land . These nutrient-rich waters teem with life , which provide humans with substantial supplies of food\u2014mainly fish , but also shellfish , mammals , and seaweed\u2014which are both harvested in the wild and farmed . The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs . Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales ' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting . Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters : even under enormous depths and pressures , nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem . Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth 's atmosphere ; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea .   The sea is an essential aspect of human trade , travel , mineral extraction , and power generation . This has also made it essential to warfare and left major cities exposed to earthquakes and volcanoes from nearby faults ; powerful tsunami waves ; and hurricanes , typhoons , and cyclones produced in the tropics . This importance and duality has affected human culture , from early sea gods to the epic poetry of Homer to the changes induced by the Columbian Exchange , from Viking funerals to Basho 's haikus to hyperrealist marine art , and inspiring music ranging from the shanties in The Complaynt of Scotland to Rimsky-Korsakov 's `` The Sea and Sinbad 's Ship '' to A-mei 's `` Listen to the Sea '' . It is the scene of leisure activities including swimming , diving , surfing , and sailing . However , population growth , industrialization , and intensive farming have all contributed to present-day marine pollution . Atmospheric carbon dioxide is being absorbed in increasing amounts , lowering its pH in a process known as ocean acidification . The shared nature of the sea has made overfishing an increasing problem .

An assassination may be prompted by religious , political , or military motives ; it is an act that may be done for financial gain , to avenge a grievance , from a desire to acquire fame or notoriety , or because of a military , security or insurgent group 's command to carry out the homicide .   Etymology   The word assassin is often believed to derive from the word Hashshashin ( Arabic : \u062d\u0634\u0651\u0627\u0634\u064a\u0646 , \u0127ashsh\u0101sh\u012by\u012bn , also Hashishin , Hashashiyyin , or Assassins ) , and shares its etymological roots with hashish ( or ; from Arabic : ' ) . It referred to a group of Nizari Shia Persians who worked against various Arab and Persian targets .   Founded by the Persian Hassan-i Sabbah , the Assassins were active in the fortress of Alamut in Iran from the 8th to the 14th centuries , and also controlled the castle of Masyaf in Syria . The group killed members of the Persian , Abbasid , Seljuq , and Christian Crusader \u00e9lite for political and religious reasons .   Although it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of hashish during their killings or during their indoctrination , there is debate as to whether these claims have merit , with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name . The earliest known literary use of the word assassination is in Macbeth by William Shakespeare ( 1605 ) .   The word for `` murder '' in many Romance languages is derived from this same root word ( see Spanish asesinato ) .   Use in history   Ancient to medieval times   Assassination is one of the oldest tools of power politics . It dates back at least as far as recorded history .   The Old Testament story of Judith illustrates how a woman frees the Israelites by tricking and assassinating Holofernes , a warlord of the rival Assyrians , with whom the Israelites were at war . King Joash of Judah was recorded as being assassinated by his own servants ; Joab assassinated Absalom , King David 's son ; and King Sennacherib of Assyria was assassinated by his own sons .   Chanakya ( c. 350\u2013283 BC ) wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise Arthashastra . His student Chandragupta Maurya , the founder of the Maurya Empire , later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies , including two of Alexander the Great 's generals , Nicanor and Philip . Other famous victims are Philip II of Macedon ( 336 BC ) , the father of Alexander the Great , and Roman consul Julius Caesar ( 44 BC ) . Emperors of Rome often met their end in this way , as did many of the Muslim Shia Imams hundreds of years later . The practice was also well known in ancient China , as in Jing Ke 's failed assassination of Qin king Ying Zheng in 227 BC . Whilst many assassination were performed by an individual or a small group , there were also specialized units who used a collective group of people to perform more than one assassination . The earliest were the sicarii in 6 A.D. , who predated the Middle Eastern assassins and Japanese ninjas by centuries .   In the Middle Ages , regicide was rare in Western Europe , but it was a recurring theme in the Eastern Roman Empire . Blinding and strangling in the bathtub were the most commonly used procedures . With the Renaissance , tyrannicide\u2014or assassination for personal or political reasons\u2014became more common again in Western Europe . High medieval sources mention the assassination of King Demetrius Zvonimir ( 1089 ) , dying at the hands of his own people , who objected to a proposition by the Pope to go on a campaign to aid the Byzantines against the Seljuk Turks . This account is , however , contentious among historians , it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes . The myth of the `` Curse of King Zvonimir '' is based on the legend of his assassination . In 1192 , Conrad of Montferrat , the de facto King of Jerusalem , was killed by an assassin .

Many Eastern authors and Western scholars argue that drug use was not the primary factor in the name.William Shakespeare's Macbeth, written in 1605, is the first known instance of using the term assassination.The root word for murder in various Romance languages is derived from the Spanish asesinato.The use of assassination as a tool for power politics dates back to the medieval period and is one of the oldest known examples.The origin of it goes back at least as far as recorded history.The Old Testament narrative Judith portrays a woman who deceives and eliminates Holofernes, despite the Israelites being at war with the Assyrians.The assassination of King Joash of Judah was reported to have been carried out by his servants;Absalom, the son of King David, was killed by Joab;King Sennacherib of Assyria was killed by his own sons.The person known as Chanakya (c.).He wrote about assassinations in great detail in his political treatise Arthashastra, which was published between 350 and 283 BC.Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Mauriere Empire, employed assassination tactics to eliminate his enemies, including Alexander the Great's generals Nicanor and Philip.Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great, and Julius Caesar, who served as Roman consul in 44 BC, are among the well-known victims.The death of Emperors of Rome and many other Shia Imams occurred in this manner hundreds of years after their deaths.Ancient China had a well-known practice of this kind, as evidenced by the unsuccessful assassination of Qin king Ying Zheng by Jing Ke in 227 BC.Although the majority of assassination attempts were carried out by one person or a small group, there were also groups that utilized multiple individuals to carry out different killings.The sicarii were the first recorded tribes in 6 A.D.The person who surpassed the Middle Eastern killers and Japanese mafia by centuries.The Eastern Roman Empire frequently featured regicide, whereas it was uncommon in Western Europe during the Middle Ages.The most prevalent methods of punishment were blinding and strangulation in the bath.Tyrannical or political assassinations began to occur again in Western Europe during the Renaissance.High medieval sources mention the assassination of King Demetrius Zvonimir (historically recorded) by his own people, who opposed the Pope's proposal to launch a military campaign against the Seljuk Turks.Historians hold differing opinions on this account, with the majority of those who follow it believing that he died of natural causes.The legend of the assassination of King Zvonimir is the basis for the mythical tale of his curse.In 1192, an assassin killed Conrad of Montferrat, who was the de facto ruler of Jerusalem.", "question": "who was the 16th president of the u.s.a.,assasinated in 1865", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "The 16th president of the U.S.A. assassinated in 1865 was Abraham Lincoln.", "modAnswer": "Abraham Lincoln.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[25, 0.2669196128845215], [26, 0.2489667683839798], [11, 0.24664084613323212], [24, 0.22209656238555908], [18, 0.21400541067123413], [31, 0.20692402124404907], [16, 0.20681151747703552], [15, 0.20124520361423492], [12, 0.19904720783233643], [29, 0.1896352767944336], [14, 0.15888220071792603], [0, 0.15656794607639313], [27, 0.15233829617500305], [21, 0.14424142241477966], [20, 0.14214825630187988], [30, 0.13567614555358887], [19, 0.13430380821228027], [6, 0.1288730502128601], [9, 0.10987461358308792], [22, 0.10828812420368195], [1, 0.10374848544597626], [13, 0.09012652188539505], [8, 0.08821120858192444], [33, 0.08387143909931183], [4, 0.06362300366163254], [2, 0.05484713241457939], [17, 0.054707784205675125], [7, 0.04484131187200546], [3, 0.04444453492760658], [5, 0.03489827364683151], [32, 0.026355821639299393], [23, 0.01843065768480301], [28, -0.0837411880493164], [10, -0.12105301767587662]]}, {"test case number": 10, "context": "Venice ( ; ) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region . It is situated across a group of 117 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by bridges . These are located in the marshy Venetian Lagoon which stretches along the shoreline , between the mouths of the Po and the Piave Rivers . Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings , their architecture , and artwork . The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site .   In 2009 , 270,098 people resided in Venice 's comune ( the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia ; of whom around 60,000 live in the historic city of Venice ( Centro storico ) ; 176,000 in Terraferma ( the mainland ) , mostly in the large frazioni ( roughly equivalent to `` parishes '' or `` wards '' in other countries ) of Mestre and Marghera ; and 31,000 on other islands in the lagoon ) . Together with Padua and Treviso , the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area ( PATREVE ) , with a total population of 2,600,000 . PATREVE is only a statistical metropolitan area without any degree of autonomy .   The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC . The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice . Venice has been known as the `` La Dominante '' , `` Serenissima '' , `` Queen of the Adriatic '' , `` City of Water '' , `` City of Masks '' , `` City of Bridges '' , `` The Floating City '' , and `` City of Canals '' .   The Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance , and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto , as well as a very important center of commerce ( especially silk , grain , and spice ) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century . This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history . It is also known for its several important artistic movements , especially the Renaissance period . After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna , the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire , until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 , following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence . Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music , and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi .   Etymology   The name of the city , deriving from Latin forms Venetia and Venetiae , is most likely taken from `` Venetia et Histria '' , the Roman name of Regio X of Roman Italy , but applied to the coastal part of the region that remained under Roman Empire outside of Gothic , Lombard , and Frankish control . The name Venetia , however , derives from the Roman name for the people known as the Veneti , and called by the Greeks Eneti ( \u1f18\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03af ) . The meaning of the word is uncertain , although there are other Indo-European tribes with similar-sounding names , such as the Celtic Veneti , Baltic Veneti , and the Slavic Wends . Linguists suggest that the name is based on an Indo-European root * wen ( `` love '' ) , so that * wenetoi would mean `` beloved '' , `` lovable '' , or `` friendly '' . A connection with the Latin word venetus , meaning the color 'sea-blue ' , is also possible .  Supposed connections of Venetia with the Latin verb venire ( to come ) , such as Marin Sanudo 's veni etiam ( `` Yet , I have come ! `` ) , the supposed cry of the first refugees to the Venetian lagoon from the mainland , or even with venia ( `` forgiveness '' ) are fanciful . The alternative obsolete form is Vinegia ; ( Venetian : Ven\u00e8xia ; ; ) .   History   Origins   Although no surviving historical records deal directly with the founding of Venice , tradition and the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original population of Venice consisted of refugees from Roman cities near Venice such as Padua , Aquileia , Treviso , Altino and Concordia ( modern Portogruaro ) and from the undefended countryside , who were fleeing successive waves", "modContext": "Venice, ;The capital of the Veneto region is located in a city in northeastern Italy.It lies on one of 117 small islands that are separated by canals and connected by bridges.The marshy Venetian Lagoon, which runs along the coast between the Po and Piave Rivers, is where these are situated.Venice is famous for its stunning landscapes, architectural styles, and artistic expressions.Both the lagoon and a section of the city are designated as World Heritage Sites.The population of the comune of Venice in 2009 was estimated to be 272,000, including the entire Comune of Venezia.Approximately 60,000 individuals reside in the historic city of Venice (Century storico);Terraferma's mainland has a population of 176,000, with most of it located in the large frazioni like Mestre and Marghera parishes or wards.Among the islands in the lagoon, there are 31,000.PATREVE, which includes Padua and Treviso, has a population of 2,600,000 people.PATREVE is a metropolitan area that has no degree of self-rule.The name is derived from the ancient Veneti tribe that settled in the area during the 10th century BC.Historically, the city was also known as the capital of the Republic of Venice.Among the many cities in the world that share similarities with others are La Dominante, Serenissima, and the Queen of the Adriatic.From the Middle Ages to the late 17th century, Venice was a major maritime power and an important center of commerce and art, as well as reviving for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto.Venice's prosperity persisted for the majority of its history.It is well-known for its numerous significant artistic movements, with the Renaissance being a notable one.The Republic was incorporated into the Austrian Empire after the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna, but it was later merged with the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 through a referendum that followed the Third Italian War of Independence.The city of Venice has been a significant hub for both symphonic and operatic music, with Antonio Vivaldi's birthplace in the city.The city's name, which has its Latin equivalents Venetia and VeNETioe, is probably derived from the Roman name of Regio X of Roman Italy, but it also refers to the coastal area that was not under Gothic, Lombard, and Frankish authority.The name Venetia is derived from the Roman term for the people, which was given to them by the Greeks Enetis ().Although there are other Indo-European tribes with similar names, such as the Celtic Veneti, Baltic VeNETi, and Slavic Wends, the meaning of the word is not yet known.It is believed by linguists that the name has its roots in an Indo-European word called *wen, which would mean \"loved\" or \"friendly\" as well.The Latin term venetus, which refers to the color'sea-blue', can also be linked to it.Venetia is believed to have connections with the Latin verb venire, which includes the phrase veni etiam in Marin Sanudo. is a fanciful expression, as the first refugees who arrived in the Venetian lagoon from the mainland called for forgiveness, or even said \"I forgive you.\"Vinegia is the obsolete variant.In the word Venetian, one can say, \"Ven\u00e8xia\".It follows that;)", "question": "canaletto is famous for his landscapes of venice and which other city?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "Canaletto is famous for his landscapes of Venice and London.", "modAnswer": "Canaletto is famous for his landscapes of Venice and London.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[0, 0.6775375604629517], [16, 0.6309171319007874], [4, 0.605552077293396], [13, 0.5594582557678223], [14, 0.4791148900985718], [19, 0.4723242521286011], [7, 0.4552074670791626], [10, 0.4283067286014557], [15, 0.423744261264801], [20, 0.40714672207832336], [6, 0.4025706350803375], [3, 0.39516958594322205], [1, 0.3584250807762146], [28, 0.35246509313583374], [5, 0.32386839389801025], [17, 0.2991425096988678], [2, 0.2798871099948883], [24, 0.2432514876127243], [18, 0.21328721940517426], [27, 0.2099950611591339], [9, 0.20736998319625854], [21, 0.18843886256217957], [25, 0.18726959824562073], [26, 0.16854391992092133], [12, 0.14414899051189423], [8, 0.12641088664531708], [29, 0.10296466946601868], [11, 0.09221264719963074], [22, 0.08066263794898987], [30, 0.05532021448016167], [23, 0.019756078720092773]]}, {"test case number": 11, "context": "The Beatles were an English rock band , formed in Liverpool in 1960 .

History   Origin   Queen Elizabeth II , in her address to Canada on Dominion Day in 1959 , pointed out that the confederation of Canada on 1 July 1867 had been the birth of the `` first independent country within the British Empire '' . She declared : `` So , it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of Nations . '' As long ago as 1884 , however , Lord Rosebery , while visiting Australia , had described the changing British Empire\u2014as some of its colonies became more independent\u2014as a `` Commonwealth of Nations '' . Conferences of British and colonial prime ministers occurred periodically from the first one in 1887 , leading to the creation of the Imperial Conferences in 1911 .   The Commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences . A specific proposal was presented by Jan Smuts in 1917 when he coined the term `` the British Commonwealth of Nations '' and envisioned the `` future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence '' at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 by delegates from the Dominions as well as Britain . The term first received imperial statutory recognition in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 , when the term British Commonwealth of Nations was substituted for British Empire in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the Irish Free State .   Dominions   In the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference , Britain and its dominions agreed they were `` equal in status , in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs , though united by common allegiance to the Crown , and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations . '' These aspects to the relationship were formalised by the Statute of Westminster in 1931 , which applied to Canada without the need for ratification , but Australia , New Zealand , and Newfoundland had to ratify the statute for it to take effect . Newfoundland never did , as on 16 February 1934 , with the consent of its parliament , the government of Newfoundland voluntarily ended and governance reverted to direct control from London . Newfoundland later joined Canada as its 10th province in 1949 . Australia and New Zealand ratified the Statute in 1942 and 1947 respectively .

Signs and symptoms   An alcohol hangover is associated with a variety of symptoms that may include drowsiness , headache , concentration problems , dry mouth , dizziness , gastrointestinal complaints , fatigue , sweating , nausea , hyper-excitability , anxiety and a feeling of general discomfort that may last more than 24 hours . Alcohol hangover symptoms develop when blood alcohol concentration falls considerably and peak when it returns to almost zero . Hangover symptoms validated in controlled studies include general malaise , thirst , headache , feeling dizzy or faint , tiredness , loss of appetite , nausea , stomach ache , and feeling as though one \u2019 s heart is racing . Some symptoms such as changes in sleep pattern and gastrointestinal distress are attributed to direct effects of the alcohol intoxication , or withdrawal symptoms . Drowsiness and impaired cognitive function are the two dominant features of alcohol hangover .   Causes   The processes which lead to hangovers are still poorly understood . Several pathophysiological changes may give rise to the alcohol hangover including increased levels of acetaldehyde , hormonal alterations of the cytokine pathways and decrease of the availability of glucose . Additional associated phenomena are dehydration , metabolic acidosis , disturbed prostaglandin synthesis , increased cardiac output , vasodilation , sleep deprivation and insufficient eating . Some complex organic molecules found in alcoholic beverages known as congeners may play an important role in producing hangover effects because some , such as methanol , are metabolized to the notably toxic substances formaldehyde and formic acid .   Pathophysiology   After being ingested , ethanol is first converted to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and then to acetic acid by oxidation process . These reactions also convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+ ) to its reduced form NADH in a redox reaction . By causing an imbalance of the NAD+/NADH redox system , alcoholic beverages make normal bodily functions more difficult . Consequences of the alcohol induced redox changes in the human body include increased triglyceride production , increased amino acid catabolism , inhibition of the citric acid cycle , lactic acidosis , ketoacidosis , hyperuricemia , disturbance in cortisol and androgen metabolism and increased fibrogenesis.The metabolism of glucose and insulin are also influenced . However , recent studies showed no significant correlation between hangover severity and the concentrations of various hormones , electrolytes , free fatty acids , triglycerides , lactate , ketone bodies , cortisol , and glucose in blood and urine samples .   Alcohol also induces the CYP2E1 enzyme , which metabolizes ethanol and other substances into more reactive toxins . In particular , in binge drinking the enzyme is activated and plays a role in creating a harmful condition known as oxidative stress which can lead to cell death .   Acetaldehyde   Acetaldehyde , the first by-product of ethanol , is between 10 and 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself and can remain at an elevated plateau for many hours after initial ethanol consumption . In addition , certain genetic factors can amplify the negative", "modContext": "The consumption of ethanol, such as wine, beer, and distilled spirits, can cause various unpleasant physiological and psychological effects, leading to a hangover.The duration of a hangover can be as long as several hours or more than 24 hours.The typical signs of a hangover include headaches, sleepiness, poor concentration, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, and digestive issues.The g.The symptoms include vomiting, lack of sustenance, sweating, nausea, hyper-excitability, and anxiety.The reasons behind a hangover are still unclear, but there are several factors implicated in the condition, including acetaldehyde, immune system changes, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, prostaglandin synthesis, cardiac output, vasodilation levels, sleep deprivation and malnutrition.Alcoholic beverages contain additives or by-products that have a specific effect on the beverage.The effects of alcohol-induced intoxication usually subside in the morning after a night of heavy drinking.Despite the availability of various remedies and folk remedies, there is no conclusive evidence to support the effectiveness of any of them in preventing or treating alcohol-related hangovers.Avoiding alcohol or consuming it in moderation is the best approach to prevent a hangover.Workplace absenteeism, impaired work performance, reduced productivity, and poor academic performance are among the health risks associated with alcohol hangovers that have socioeconomic implications.A hangover can hinder the ability to engage in potentially hazardous daily activities, such as operating heavy machinery or driving a car.Signs and symptoms of an alcohol hangover include drowsiness, headaches, concentration issues, dry mouth, dizziness, digestive problems, fatigue, sweating, nausea, hyperexcitability, anxiety, and a sense of discomfort that may persist for more than 1-2 days.Alcohol hangover symptoms occur when blood alcohol concentration drops significantly and then reaches a peak at almost zero.The effects of hangovers, as confirmed by controlled studies, include general symptoms such as malaise, thirst, headache, dizziness, tiredness and loss of appetite, nausea, stomach ache, and the sensation of heart racing.Changes in sleep patterns and gastrointestinal distress are among the direct effects of alcohol intoxication, which can cause withdrawal symptoms.Drowsiness and impaired cognitive function are the most common symptoms of alcohol hangover.The causes of hangovers are still not fully understood.The occurrence of alcohol hangover is caused by various pathophysiological changes, such as increased levels of acetaldehyde, hormonal changes in cytokine pathways, and reduced glucose availability.Other related phenomena include dehydration, metabolic acidosis, disruption of prostaglandin synthesis, increased cardiac output, vasodilator, sleep deprivation and insufficient eating.Alcoholic congeners, which are complex organic molecules, can contribute significantly to hangover effects by metabolizing highly toxic formaldehyde and formic acid.The pathophysiology of ethanol consumption involves the conversion of esterified ion channels into acetaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase and then oxidation into alpha-1/0.These reactions also alter the synthesis of NAD+ adenine dinucleotide.In a redox reaction, NADH is converted into its reduced form.The imbalance in NAD+ levels was caused by it.The redox system of NADH and alcohol-containing beverages make it more difficult to function normally.The human body experiences a range of redox changes, including increased triglyceride production, increased amino acid catabolism, citric acid cycle inhibition, lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis in the hypothalamus, hyperuricemia, disturbance of cortisol and androgen metabolism, and increased fibrinogenesis.Insulin and glucose metabolism are also impacted.Recent studies have found no significant differences between the concentration of different hormones, electrolytes, free fatty acids, triglycerides, lactate, ketones, cortisol, and glucose in blood or urine samples and demonstrated an associated decrease in hangover symptoms.The CYP2E1 enzyme is stimulated by alcohol, which converts ethanol and other substances into more reactive toxins.During binge drinking, the enzyme activation leads to oxidative stress, which can cause cell death.The acetaldehyde, the primary product of ethanol, is 10 to 30 times more poisonous than alcohol and can persist at a high level for several hours after initial consumption.", "question": "supposedly a hangover cure, which drink consists of a raw egg, worcestershire sauce and typically a hot sauce with condiments?",

furniture . Fashion is a distinctive and often  constant trend in the style in which a person dresses . It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers . Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked to the term `` fashion '' , the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear , while `` fashion '' generally means clothing , including the study of it . Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine , some trends are androgynous .   Clothing fashions   Early Western travelers , whether to Persia , Turkey , India , China , would frequently remark on the absence of change in fashion there . The Japanese Shogun 's secretary bragged ( not completely accurately ) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years . However , there is considerable evidence in Ming China of rapidly changing fashions in Chinese clothing . Changes in costume often took place at times of economic or social change , as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate , followed by a long period without major changes . In 8th-century Moorish Spain , the musician Ziryab introduced to C\u00f3rdoba sophisticated clothing-styles based on seasonal and daily fashions from his native Baghdad , modified by his own inspiration . Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the Turks , who introduced clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East .   The beginning in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated . Historians , including James Laver and Fernand Braudel , date the start of Western fashion in clothing to the middle of the 14th century . The most dramatic early change in fashion was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment from calf-length to barely covering the buttocks , sometimes accompanied with stuffing in the chest to make it look bigger . This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers .   The pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century , and women and men 's fashion , especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair , became equally complex . Art historians are therefore able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images , often to within five years , particularly in the case of images from the 15th century . Initially , changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles . These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again , mostly originating from Ancien R\u00e9gime France . Though the rich usually led fashion , the increasing affluence of early modern Europe led to the bourgeoisie and even peasants following trends at a distance , but still uncomfortably close for the elites \u2013 a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion .   In the 16th century , national differences were at their most pronounced . Ten 16th century portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats . Albrecht D\u00fcrer illustrated the differences in his actual ( or composite ) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century ( illustration , right ) . The `` Spanish style '' of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans , and after a struggle in the mid-17th century , French styles decisively took over leadership , a process completed in the 18th century .   Though textile colors and patterns changed from year to year , the cut of a gentleman 's coat and the length of his waistcoat , or the pattern to which a lady 's dress was cut , changed more slowly . Men 's fashions were largely derived from military models , and changes in a European male Silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of foreign styles such as the `` Steinkirk '' cravat or necktie .   Though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France since the 16th century and Abraham Bosse had produced engravings of fashion in the 1620s , the pace of change", "modContext": "Fashion is a widely accepted fashion style, particularly in the areas of clothing, footwear, accessories, makeup, body art, and furniture.A person's fashion sense is characterized by a distinct and consistent trend.The most prevailing fashions in behavior and the latest innovations of textile designers.The use of the term costume has been relegated to specific meanings like fancy dress or masquerade wear, as the more technical term is often associated with the study of clothing.Fashion can be characterized by both masculine and feminine characteristics, but some styles are more accurately described as androgynous.The lack of change in clothing styles was a common observation made by early Western visitors, particularly those traveling to places like Persia, Turkey, India, and China.During a Spanish visit in 1609, the Japanese Shogun's secretary boasted that Japanese clothing had not changed for over 2,000 years.Despite this, there is ample proof in Ming China of swiftly evolving fashion trends in Chinese attire.During periods of economic or social change, such as ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate, changes in clothing frequently occurred, but no significant changes were observed for an extended period.In Moorish Spain during the 8th century, Ziryab, a musician, introduced sophisticated clothing-styles to C\u00f3rdoba that were inspired by his hometown of Baghdad and tailored to seasonal and daily styles.The Middle East experienced comparable fashion shifts in the 11th century when Turks arrived, introducing clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East.Europe's history of a continuous and swiftly evolving fashion revolution can be traced back to earlier times.Western clothing has its origins in the middle of the 14th century, as recorded by historians like James Laver and Fernand Braudel.A significant change in fashion during the early stages of development was the abrupt reduction and tightening of male over-garments, which went from being calf-length to just covering the buttocks, and sometimes included stuffing in the chest to make them appear bigger.The creation of a tailored top worn with leggings or trousers gave rise to the distinctive Western appearance.The next century witnessed a significant acceleration in change, with both genders experiencing equally intricate fashion trends, particularly in hair dressing and styling.By using fashion with precision and confidence, art historians can date images within five years, often including those from the 15th century.The upper classes in Europe were divided by changes in fashion, which resulted in the emergence of unique national styles.The national styles were markedly different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries, which enforced similar styles, mostly originating from Ancien R\u00e9gime France.Despite the fact that wealthy individuals were typically the most influential in fashion, the rise of wealth in early modern Europe resulted in the bourgeoisie and peasants adopting trends that were still not easily achievable by the elites.National differences were at their highest level in the 16th century.Ten portraits from the 16th century of German or Italian men may feature ten distinct headwear.At the end of the 15th century, Albrecht D\u00fcrer exhibited the differences between Nuremberg and Venetian fashions.Spanish style in the late 16th century initiated a return to harmony among upper class Europeans, and French styles took over leadership after ten years. This process was completed in 18th-century England.Although the colors and patterns of textiles changed from one year to another, the pattern that women wore in their dresses slowly evolved over time.Men's attire was largely influenced by military models, and the European male Silhouette underwent changes in wartime settings where gentleman officers could document foreign styles like the cravat or necktie.", "question": "what formal menswear, often abbreviated to three letters, is named after a new york park where it was first worn in the 1880s?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "Tux.", "modAnswer": "The answer is \"tux\".", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[14, 0.43485963344573975], [24, 0.418067067861557], [12, 0.40146204829216003], [25, 0.38494837284088135], [21, 0.3834945559501648], [13, 0.3299351930618286], [3, 0.32742637395858765], [18, 0.3195589482784271], [5, 0.31824082136154175], [17, 0.31671690940856934], [20, 0.3140515387058258], [4, 0.3056034445762634], [15, 0.3035588264465332], [0, 0.29802361130714417], [6, 0.262279748916626], [16, 0.24993814527988434], [10, 0.24944350123405457], [11, 0.24716997146606445], [23, 0.2464449107646942], [22, 0.24592643976211548], [1, 0.22276249527931213], [19, 0.22054195404052734], [8, 0.20799320936203003], [9, 0.13390319049358368], [2, 0.1281757801771164], [7, 0.11088630557060242]]}, {"test case number": 18, "context": "The UK Singles Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom .

Pitches are available for amateur sports such as Football , Volleyball and Lacrosse . There is a cricket pavilion at the William Street entrance to the ground . The council-run Sports and Leisure Centre is located on the southern edge of the Rec , accessed via North Parade .   In former years the Rec was subject to periodic flooding from the River Avon , but a flood alleviation scheme in the 1960s improved the flow of the river . However , the Rec remains part of the floodplain at risk of occasional flooding . The ground can still get very boggy after heavy rains .   History   In the early part of the 1890s , the land on which the Recreation Ground now lies as well as the North Parade land were part of the Bathwick Estate , which was owned by the Forester family . In 1894 , a lease was granted to the Directors of The Bath and County Recreation Ground Company Limited by Captain G W Forester . This lease allowed work to be carried out on the land which would make it suitable for cricket matches , lawn tennis and archery tournaments , football matches and all other outdoor sports . As part of this work , a cricket pavilion was started on the north side of the ground . The first Bath rugby matches were also played on the ground in 1884 . Three years later , the ground hosted its maiden first-class cricket match , with Somerset County Cricket Club hosting the Gentlemen of Philadelphia as part of the Bath Cricket Festival . The company 's lease was extended for a further 21 years in 1908 , at a rent of \u00a3100 per year . Fourteen years later , the land was conveyed to The Bath and County Recreation Ground Company Limited for \u00a36,050 . The company then conveyed the North Parade Land , including a building which was used as an ice skating rink , to Bath Artcraft Limited for \u00a32,500 .   A new lease was granted to Bath F.C . in 1927 , allowing them the use of the land on the west side of ground , along with a Grand Stand , a New ( North ) Stand and a Pavilion , for a term of 25 years . Six years later the lease was surrendered , and a new 50-year lease was granted . In the same year , the Grand Stand was replaced with a new West Stand . This was significantly bomb-damaged during the Second World War . Rebuilding of the stand , at a cost in excess of \u00a312,000 , was met by the War Damage Commission in 1953\u201354 . The 'Club Room ' building was erected in 1954 , to the west of the North Stand , and during the same year a lease was granted to allow a tennis club to use the north east corner of the ground . In 1956 , the ground was conveyed to the Mayor Aldermen and the Citizens of the City of Bath ( the Corporation ) for \u00a311,155 .   Bath F.C . surrendered their 1933 lease , and were granted a new 75-year lease in 1973 . In 1974 , both the Recreation Ground and the North Parade Land were transferred to Bath City Council , who erected a Sports and Leisure Centre on the south side in 1975 . In 1995 , Bath F.C . were granted a further 75-year lease .

In common English , they are known as the crow family , or , more technically , corvids . Over 120 species are described . The genus Corvus , including the jackdaws , crows , and ravens , makes up over a third of the entire family .   They are considered the most intelligent of the birds , and among the most intelligent of all animals , having demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests ( European magpies ) and tool-making ability ( crows , rooks ) \u2014skills until recently regarded as solely the province of humans and a few other higher mammals . Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to that of great apes and cetaceans , and only slightly lower than in humans .   They are medium to large in size , with strong feet and bills , rictal bristles , and a single moult each year ( most passerines moult twice ) . Corvids are found worldwide except for the tip of South America and the polar ice caps . The majority of the species are found in tropical South and Central America , southern Asia and Eurasia , with fewer than 10 species each in Africa and Australasia . The genus Corvus has re-entered Australia in relatively recent geological prehistory , with five species and one subspecies there .   Systematics , taxonomy , and evolution   Over the years , much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives . What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world . Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse , but often Australasian groups . In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s , Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida , based on DNA-DNA hybridization . The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs , birds of paradise , whipbirds , quail-thrushes , whistlers , monarch flycatchers and drongos , shrikes , vireos , and vangas , but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial . The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea , together with their closest relatives ( the birds of paradise , Australian mud-nesters and shrikes ) . They are also the core group of the Corvida , which includes the related groups , such as orioles and vireos .   Clarification of the interrelationships of the corvids has been achieved based on cladistic analysis of several DNA sequences . The jays and magpies do not constitute monophyletic lineages , but rather seem to split up into an American and Old World lineage , and an Holarctic and Oriental lineage , respectively . These are not closely related among each other . The position of the azure-winged magpie , which has always been a major enigma , is even less clear than before .

Transportation is not the only purpose of cruising , particularly on cruises that return passengers to their originating port , with the ports of call usually in a specified region of a continent . There are even `` cruises to nowhere '' or `` nowhere voyages '' where the ship makes 2\u20133 night round trips without any ports of call .   By contrast , dedicated transport oriented ocean liners do `` line voyages '' and typically transport passengers from one point to another , rather than on round trips . Traditionally , an ocean liner for the transoceanic trade will be built to a higher standard than a typical cruise ship , including high freeboard and stronger plating to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean , such as the North Atlantic . Ocean liners also usually have larger capacities for fuel , food , and other stores for consumption on long voyages , compared to dedicated cruise ships .   Although often luxurious , ocean liners had characteristics that made them unsuitable for cruising , such as high fuel consumption , deep draught that prevented their entering shallow ports , enclosed weatherproof decks that were not appropriate for tropical weather , and cabins designed to maximize passenger numbers rather than comfort ( such as a high proportion of windowless suites ) . The gradual evolution of passenger ship design from ocean liners to cruise ships has seen passenger cabins shifted from inside the hull to the superstructure with private verandas . The modern cruise ships , while sacrificing qualities of seaworthiness , have added amenities to cater to water tourists , and recent vessels have been described as `` balcony-laden floating condominiums '' .   The distinction between ocean liners and cruise ships has blurred , particularly with respect to deployment . Differences in construction remain . Larger cruise ships have also engaged in longer trips such as transoceanic voyages which may not return to the same port for months ( longer round trips ) .

contrast, do line voyages and usually transport passengers from one location to another instead of doing a round trip.Traditionally, an ocean liner intended for the transoceanic trade has been constructed to exceed the performance of a typical cruise ship, with high freeboard and stronger plating to ensure it can withstand rough seas and adverse weather conditions in the open ocean, such as the North Atlantic.Unlike dedicated cruise ships, ocean liners usually have more extensive provisions for fuel, food, and other supplies during extended voyages.Ocean liners, while often luxurious, had certain features that made them unsuitable for cruising: high fuel consumption, heavy wind interference to enter shallow ports, weatherproof decks that were not suitable for tropical climates, and cabins prioritized for maximum comfort rather than convenience.As the design of passenger ships has evolved from oceanliners to cruise ships, the hull's interior has been replaced by superstructures with private verandas.Despite their seaworthy status, cruise ships of the present day offer extra amenities to accommodate water enthusiasts, and recent vessels have been described as floating condominiums filled with balconies.The separation between ocean liners and cruise ships has become less clear, especially with regards to deployment.Disparities in building design persist.Longer transoceanic voyages, such as those on a larger cruise ship, have resulted in longer trips that may take several months to complete.Marco Polo and other former ocean liners now function as cruise

Between 2010 and 2015 it was the largest single party with 306 Members of Parliament and governed in coalition with the Liberal Democrats . It is the largest party in local government with 8,296 councillors .   The Conservative Party was founded in 1834 from the Tory Party\u2014giving rise to the Conservatives ' colloquial name of Tories\u2014and was one of two dominant parties in the 19th century , along with the Liberal Party . In the 1920s , the Liberal vote greatly diminished and the Labour Party became the Conservatives ' main rivals . Conservative Prime Ministers led governments for 57 years of the 20th century , including Winston Churchill ( 1940\u201345 , 1951\u201355 ) and Margaret Thatcher ( 1979\u201390 ) . Thatcher 's tenure led to wide-ranging economic liberalisation and saw the Conservatives become the most eurosceptic of the three major parties . The Conservative Party 's domination of British politics throughout the 20th century have led to them being referred to as one of the most successful political parties in the Western world .   The Conservatives are the joint-second largest British party in the European Parliament , with twenty MEPs , and sit with the European Conservatives and Reformists ( ECR ) parliamentary group . The party is a member of the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists ( AECR ) Europarty and the International Democrat Union ( IDU ) .   The party is the second-largest in the Scottish Parliament and third-largest in the Welsh Assembly . The Conservatives were formerly allied to the Ulster Unionist Party ( UUP ) in Northern Ireland but there is now a separate Northern Ireland Conservative party similar to the Welsh and Scottish Conservative parties . The party is also organised in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar .   History   Pittites   The Conservative Party traces its origins to a faction , rooted in the 18th century Whig Party , that coalesced around William Pitt the Younger ( Prime Minister of Great Britain 1783\u20131801 and 1804\u20131806 ) . They were known as `` Independent Whigs '' , `` Friends of Mr Pitt '' , or `` Pittites '' . After Pitt 's death the term `` Tory '' came into use . This was an allusion to the Tories , a political grouping that had existed from 1678 , but which had no organisational continuity with the Pittite party . From about 1812 on the name `` Tory '' was commonly used for the newer party .   The term `` Conservative '' was suggested as a title for the party by a magazine article by J. Wilson Croker in the Quarterly Review in 1830 . The name immediately caught on and was officially adopted under the aegis of Sir Robert Peel around 1834 . Peel is acknowledged as the founder of the Conservative Party , which he created with the announcement of the Tamworth Manifesto . The term `` Conservative Party '' rather than Tory was the dominant usage by 1845 .   Conservatives and Unionists ( 1867\u20131965 )   The widening of the electoral franchise in the 19th century forced the Conservative Party to popularise its approach under Lord Derby and Benjamin Disraeli , who carried through their own expansion of the franchise with the Reform Act of 1867 . In 1886 the party formed an alliance with Lord Hartington ( later the 8th Duke of Devonshire ) and Joseph Chamberlain 's new Liberal Unionist Party and , under the statesmen Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour , held power for all but three of the following twenty years before suffering a heavy defeat in 1906 when it split over the issue of free trade . In 1912 , the Liberal Unionists merged with the Conservative party . In Ireland , the Irish Unionist Alliance had been formed in 1891 which merged anti-Home Rule Unionists into one political movement . Its MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster , and in essence formed the Irish wing of the party until 1922 .   First World War   The Conservatives served with the Liberals in an all-party coalition government during World War I , and the coalition continued under the Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George ( with half of the Liberals ) until 1922 .

New Zealand is situated some 1500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1000 km south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal , fungal and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , while its most populous city is Auckland .   Sometime between 1250 and 1300 CE , Polynesians settled in the islands that would later become New Zealand , and developed a distinctive M\u0101ori culture . In 1642 , Abel Tasman , a Dutch explorer , became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the British Crown and M\u0101ori Chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , making New Zealand a British colony . Today , the majority of New Zealand 's population of 4.7 million is of European descent ; the indigenous M\u0101ori are the largest minority , followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders . Reflecting this , New Zealand 's culture is mainly derived from M\u0101ori and early British settlers , with recent broadening arising from increased immigration . The official languages are English , M\u0101ori and New Zealand Sign Language , with English predominant .   New Zealand is a developed country with a market economy . New Zealand is a World Bank high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance , such as health , education , economic freedom and quality of life . Nationally , legislative authority is vested in an elected , unicameral Parliament , while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet , led by the Prime Minister , who is currently John Key . Queen Elizabeth II is the country 's head of state and is represented by a Governor-General . In addition , New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes . The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau ( a dependent territory ) ; the Cook Islands and Niue ( self-governing states in free association with New Zealand ) ; and the Ross Dependency , which is New Zealand 's territorial claim in Antarctica . New Zealand is a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , Pacific Islands Forum , and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation .   Etymology   Dutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and called it Staten Landt , supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America . In 1645 , Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland . British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand .   Aotearoa ( often translated as `` land of the long white cloud '' ) is the current M\u0101ori name for New Zealand . It is unknown whether M\u0101ori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans , with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island . M\u0101ori had several traditional names for the two main islands , including Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui ( the fish of M\u0101ui ) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu ( the waters of greenstone ) or Te Waka o Aoraki ( the canoe of Aoraki ) for the South Island . Early European maps labelled the islands North ( North Island ) , Middle ( South Island ) and South ( Stewart Island / Rakiura ) . In 1830 , maps began to use North and South to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 , this was the accepted norm . The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised , and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013 . This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui , and South Island or Te Waipounamu . Note that for each island , either its English or M\u0101ori name can be used , or both can be used together .

Waipounamu on South Island, as well as several smaller islands.The Pacific island regions of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga are located approximately 1500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea, while New Zealand is roughly 1000 km to the south.Its remoteness meant that it was one of the last places for humans to settle in the lands.During its extended period of isolation, New Zealand developed a unique range of animal, fungal, and plant species.The country's varied terrain and towering mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, are largely due to the impact of volcanic eruptions and land uplift.Wellington is the capital city of New Zealand, and Auckland is its most populous city.A unique Mori culture was developed by the Polynesian inhabitants of the islands that would later become New Zealand between 1250 and 1300 CE.The first European to see New Zealand was Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer who did so in 1642.The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 by British Crown and Mori Chiefs, resulted in New Zealand becoming a British colony.Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 4 is concentrated in this location.7 million people are of European origin;The Mori population is the most populous, with Asians and Pacific Islanders making up the second, third, and fourth largest minority groups.New Zealand's culture is largely influenced by Mori and early British colonizers, with the latter having expanded its influence due to increased immigration.English, Mori, and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages, with English being the most commonly used.The economy of New Zealand is based on market practices, making it a developed nation.New Zealand's high-income economy status is backed by the World Bank, which places it highly in international benchmarks for its health, education, economic freedom, and quality of life.The elected, unicameral Parliament has the power to enact laws for the nation, while the Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister John Key, exercises executive political authority.Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a Governor-General.New Zealand's local government is divided into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities.Tokelau is a constituent of New Zealand's Realm and falls under its sovereignty;The Cook Islands and Niue, which are both independent nations in free association with New Zealand;The Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica.The Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation are all organizations in which New Zealand is a member.In 1642, Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand and named it Staten Landt, possibly because he believed it was linked to a landmass located at the southernmost point of South America.Nova Zeelandia was the new title given to the land by Dutch cartographers in 1645, taking its name from the Dutch province of Zealand.The name of New Zealand was later anglicized by British explorer James Cook.Aotearoa, which means \"land of the long white cloud,\" is the Mori name for New Zealand.It is uncertain whether Mori had a name for the entire country before Europeans arrived, as Aotearoa was originally limited to the North Island.Te Waipounamu or Te Waka o Aoraki were the names given to the canoe of Aori on the South Island, while the North Island was named as Te Ika-a-Mui (the fish of Mnui), which is another nomenclature for the islanders.The North, Middle, and South Islands were categorized as such on early European maps.The use of North and South on maps to differentiate the two largest islands was introduced in 1830 and became standard practice by 1907.The North Island and South Island's names were found to be unofficial by the New Zealand Geographic Board in 2009, with alternative names being formalised in 2013.Te Ika-a-Mui in North Island and Te Waipounamu in South Island were the two names chosen for this location.It is important to note that each island can be referred to using either its English or Mori name, or both at the same time.",

The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015 .   Alberta is bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east , the Northwest Territories to the north , and the U.S. state of Montana to the south . Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than to areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming .   Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , oil sands ( Athabasca oil sands ) and other northern resource industries .   About 290 km south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta . Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta 's two census metropolitan areas , both of which have populations exceeding one million , while the province has 16 census agglomerations . Tourist destinations in the province include Banff , Canmore , Drumheller , Jasper and Sylvan Lake .   Etymology   Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta ( 1848\u20131939 ) , the fourth daughter of Victoria , Queen of Canada , and Albert , Prince Consort . Princess Louise was the wife of John Campbell , Marquess of Lorne , Governor General of Canada ( 1878\u201383 ) . Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour .

To the south , the province borders on the 49th parallel north , separating it from the US state of Montana , while on the north the 60th parallel north divides it from the Northwest Territories . To the east , the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan , while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60\u00b0N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains , and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49\u00b0N .   The province extends 1223 km north to south and 660 km east to west at its maximum width . Its highest point is 3747 m at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border , while its lowest point is 152 m on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast .   With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the southeastern section , the province has adequate water resources . There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming , fishing and a range of water sports . There are three large lakes , Lake Claire ( 1436 km2 ) in Wood Buffalo National Park , Lesser Slave Lake ( 1168 km2 ) , and Lake Athabasca ( 7898 km2 ) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan . The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels 1538 km from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca . The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3/s . The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River , a tributary of the Mackenzie River .   Alberta 's capital city , Edmonton , is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province . It is the most northerly major city in Canada , and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada . The region , with its proximity to Canada 's largest oil fields , has most of western Canada 's oil refinery capacity .

A very small number of women have been bullfighters on foot or on horseback ; one recent example is Cristina S\u00e1nchez .

Bullfighting on horseback became a separate and distinct act called `` rejoneo '' which is still performed today -- although , not as often as bullfighting itself does on foot .   Bullfighting on foot became a means for poor , able-bodied men to achieve fame and fortune , similar to the role of boxing in the United States .

The story concerns a middle-aged middle manager , Reginald `` Reggie '' Perrin , who is driven to bizarre behaviour by the pointlessness of his job at Sunshine Desserts . The sitcom proved to be a subversion of others of the era , which were often based on bland middle-class suburban family life .   The first novel in the series , The Death of Reginald Perrin , was published in 1975 , with later editions retitled to match the title of the television series .

Perrin, was also written by Nobbs and released in 1996.Series One, which ran from August 8 to 20 October 1976, was the first series that centered on Nobbs' novel The Death of Reginald Perrin and was later renamed The Fall and Rise of Regaldo to complement the TV show.The replacement title is still in use for it.The mid-life crisis of Reginald Iolanthe Perrin is causing him to try and escape from his miserable life.The Poets Estate in Climthorpe, located at 12 Coleridge Close, is where he lives, and it differs from other areas due to the streets being named after well-known poets.He works as a sales executive at Sunshine Desserts and travels to his workplace.Despite being 11 minutes late each morning (and increasing in length to 17 and 22 minutes with series), he still gives different justifications every morning.These phenomena become more and more peculiar, with a defective junction box in New Malden being one of the more plausible scenarios;The lack of punishment at Chessington North was a reflection of the decline of both British Rail and his own mental health.The office building attracts him into the door with the sign \" Sunshine Desserts'', but as the series progresses, he loses more and more letters.Reggie, who goes by the name Walter Mitty, has a dream about himself.A portion of the tale reveals what voices within his head are saying.Despite his apparent love for his wife, he fantasizes about his secretary, Joan Greengross.His erratic behavior results in him being unable to write letters without using words like \" breast ''.\"Joan is not bothered by the attention and changes her posture to showcase her figure.The endless marketing campaigns for peculiar products, satirized in reports from the product research department, and Reggie's interactions with his oppressive boss  CJ and his yes-man subordinates are driving him insane.He is unconcerned about the aftermath and dictates disrespectful and condescending remarks to customers.There is no improvement in home decor.Despite his affectionate relationship with his wife Elizabeth, he is rendered impotent.The intensification of work pressures leads to a decline in relationships with his dysfunctional family members, particularly those of his less capable brothers and sisters Jimmy and Tom, who are both highly visible due to their political correctness.Despite some daring deeds, including leaving his car in the lion enclosure at a safari park, Reggie fakes suicide by leaving clothes and personal effects behind on ice on an oceanfront.Prior to sending an anonymous threat, he instructed CJ to release loganberry essence into a stream.Doc Morrisey, the doctor at the company, pronounces CJ dead after he collapses.With one eye open, CJ declares, 'You're no longer with us!'",

Definitions   Pre-twentieth-century   The English term `` natural history '' is a translation of the Latin historia naturalis .

In antiquity , it covered essentially anything connected with nature or which used materials drawn from nature . For example , Pliny the Elder 's encyclopedia of this title , published circa 77 to 79 AD , covers astronomy , geography , man and his technology , medicine and superstition as well as animals and plants .   Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions : the humanities ( primarily what is now known as classics ) and divinity , with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment . The study of nature revived in the Renaissance , and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge , itself divided into descriptive natural history and natural philosophy , the analytical study of nature . In modern terms , natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern physics and chemistry , while natural history included the biological and geological sciences . The two were strongly associated . During the heyday of the gentleman scientists , many people contributed to both fields , and early papers in both were commonly read at professional science society meetings such as the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences \u2013 both founded during the seventeenth century .   Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives , such as Linnaeus ' aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden . Similarly , the Industrial Revolution prompted the development of geology to help find useful mineral deposits .   The astronomer , William Herschel was also a natural historian . Instead of working with plants or minerals he worked with the stars . He spent his time building telescopes to see the stars and the rest of the time watching the stars . In the beginning , he believed there to be an object known as a nebulae , but then later realized it was just another stage in star development . Herschel can be considered a natural historian because he observed the natural world and attempted to understand it . In the process he made charts of all the stars and kept records of all that he saw ( while his sister Caroline did all the documenting ) .   Post-nineteenth-century   Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources , and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field , creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them . For example , while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study , it can also be defined as a body of knowledge , and as a craft or a practice , in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed .   Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment , as seen in this definition by Marston Bates : `` Natural history is the study of animals and Plants \u2013 of organisms . ... I like to think , then , of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual \u2013 of what plants and animals do , how they react to each other and their environment , how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities '' and this more recent definition by D.S .

About 85 % of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride . Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature . Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides , the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun . The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth ( the Coriolis effect ) .

Under the Roman Empire , many villas were constructed there , after Agrippina the Elder ( 14 BC \u2013 18 October AD 33 ) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD . In AD 40 , her son , Emperor Caligula ( 31 August AD 12\u201324 January AD 41 ; r. 37\u201341 ) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers ( AD 40 ) that was later completed by Nero , the Circus Gaii et Neronis , usually called , simply , the Circus of Nero .   Even before the arrival of Christianity , it is supposed that this originally uninhabited part of Rome ( the ager vaticanus ) had long been considered sacred , or at least not available for habitation . A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby .   The particularly low quality of Vatican wine , even after the reclamation of the area , was commented on by the poet Martial ( 40 \u2013 between 102 and 104 AD ) . In AD 69 , the Year of the Four Emperors , when the northern army that brought Vitellius to power arrived in Rome , `` a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican , which

(;It follows that;The State of Vatican City, also known as Vatican Palace, is officially recognized.In the city of Rome, there is a walled area.With a population of 842 and an area of roughly 44 hectares ( 110 acres), it is the world's smallest state in terms of both population and size.The Pope, as the Bishop of Rome, governs a type of theocracy known as an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state.Catholic clergy of different nationalities are appointed as the highest state functionaries.Since their return from Avignon in 1377, the Popes have primarily resided in the Apostolic Palace located inside Vatican City, with occasional stays in other locations such as the Quirinal Palace in Rome.The Holy See, which has its roots in early Christianity, is the primary episcopal see of 1 and is not linked to Vatican City.The number of Catholic followers worldwide is 2 billion, including both Latin and Eastern denominations.However, the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy in 1929 brought about the establishment of an independent city-state, which was viewed as a new entity rather than relict from the much larger Papal States ( 756\u20131870) that had previously covered much of central Italy.The treaty stipulates that the Holy See has exclusive control, sovereignty, and ownership over the city-state.St. is one of the religious and cultural sites within Vatican City.The Vatican Museums, the Sistine Chapel and Peter's Basilica.Some of the most renowned paintings and sculptures in the world are showcased.The Vatican City's distinct economic structure is sustained by the sale of postage stamps and tourist memorabilia, museum admission fees, and the marketing of magazines.The Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, brought the name of the modern city-state into existence.The state's name is derived from Vatican Hill, which is its geographical location.The name \"Vax\" is derived from the Etruscan settlement of Vatica, or Vaticum, which means garden in Latin and refers to the general area that the Romans called vaticanus ager, also known as Vatican territory.The city's official name in Italy is'or, which means the Vatican City State.The official documents of the Holy See and the Catholic Church use Ecclesiastical Latin, whereas Vatican City uses Italian.The name in Latin signifies ';Not only the Holy See, but also most official Church and Papal documents make use of this.The Roman Republic's early history revealed that the name Vatican was already in use for a barren area on the west bank of the Tiber, opposite Rome.Following the Roman Empire's occupation of the area by Agrippina the Elder, who drained it and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD, many villas were constructed in that location.Her son, Emperor Caligula (31 August AD 12\u201324 January AD 41), was born in AD 40;The r.A circus for charioteers was built in her gardens between AD 40 and completed by Nero, known as the Circus Gaii et Neronis, which is commonly referred to as The Circus of Neremo.Prior to the arrival of Christianity, the ager vaticanus, a former Roman holy area, was believed to have been considered sacred or unattainable.After the foundation of the Constantinian Basilica of St., a shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her lover Attis was still in operation.Peter was constructed in the vicinity.Despite the reclamation of the area, Martial, a poet aged 40 and from 102 to 104 AD, commented on the low quality of Vatican wine.When the northern army that enlisted Vitellius arrived in Rome during the Year of the Four Emperors in AD69, they frequently stationed themselves near the unhealthy Vatican districts to save many soldiers who were on the streets.", "question": "only two

During Labour 's time in Opposition to Margaret Thatcher 's Conservative government , he rose through the Shadow Cabinet , serving as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade ( 1979\u20131982 ) , Shadow Secretary of State for Energy ( 1982\u20131983 ) , Shadow Secretary of State for Employment ( 1983\u20131984 ) , Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry ( 1984\u20131987 ) and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer ( 1987\u20131992 ) .   After Labour leader Neil Kinnock resigned following the Party 's surprise loss in the 1992 general election to new Conservative leader John Major , Smith was elected his successor in July 1992 . He continued Kinnock 's moves to reform Labour , abolishing the trade union block vote at Labour party conferences and replacing it with `` one member , one vote '' at the 1993 party conference . However , his overall cautious approach to reform , which was dubbed `` one more heave '' , sought to avoid controversy and win the next election by capitalising on the unpopularity of the Conservative government . This frustrated many modernisers like Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and after Smith 's sudden death in May 1994 , he was succeeded as Leader by Blair , who undertook the subsequent re-branding of Labour as New Labour , winning the 1997 general election in a landslide .   Early life   The son of a headmaster , Smith was born in Dalmally , Argyll , and grew up in Ardrishaig . He attended Dunoon Grammar School , lodging in the town with a landlady and going home during the holidays , before enrolling at the University of Glasgow , where he studied History from 1956 to 1959 , and then Law , from 1959 to 1962 . He joined the Labour Party in 1956 .   He became involved in debating with the Glasgow University Dialectic Society and the Glasgow University Union . In 1962 , he won The Observer Mace debating competition , speaking with Gordon Hunter . In 1995 , after his death , the competition was renamed the John Smith Memorial Mace in his honour .   After graduating , Smith practised as a solicitor for a year . He was then elected to the Faculty of Advocates ( the Scottish equivalent of being called to the bar ) .   Member of Parliament   Smith first stood as a Labour parliamentary candidate at a by-election in 1961 in the East Fife constituency ; he contested that seat again in the 1964 general election . At the 1970 general election , he was elected as Member of Parliament ( MP ) for North Lanarkshire succeeding Margaret Herbison . Smith defied the Labour whips in 1971 , joining Labour MPs led by Roy Jenkins who voted in favour of entry to the European Economic Community . These included Roy Hattersley , Shirley Williams , Bill Rodgers and David Owen all of whom he was later to sit with in the Callaghan cabinet .   In government   In October 1974 , Harold Wilson offered Smith the post of Solicitor General for Scotland . Smith turned it down , not wishing his political career to become sidelined as a law officer . He was instead made an Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Energy . In December 1975 , he was made a Minister of State . When James Callaghan became Prime Minister , Smith became a Minister of State at the Privy Council Office , serving with Labour 's Deputy leader , Michael Foot , the Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons . In this position Smith piloted the highly controversial devolution proposals for Scotland and Wales through the House of Commons . Smith 's adroit handling of these proposals impressed Callaghan , and in November 1978 , when Edmund Dell retired , Callaghan appointed Smith Secretary of State for Trade .

It has sold consistently well ever since and has received unanimous critical acclaim , with NME listing it as the greatest album of all time in 2013 .   Songwriting   Guitarist Johnny Marr wrote several songs that would later appear on The Queen Is Dead while the Smiths toured Britain in early 1985 , working out song arrangements with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce during soundchecks . The title of the album is from the novel , `` Last Exit to Brooklyn '' by author Hubert Selby , Jr ..

The title could also refer to a scene in Cymbeline where Cornelius , the doctor , informs Cymbeline , the king , `` The queen is dead .

The first of these is reputed to have been addressed to Geoff Travis , head of the Smiths ' record label Rough Trade . Travis has since described it as `` a funny lyric '' about `` Morrissey 's desire to be somewhere else '' , acknowledging that a line in the song about `` bloody awful poetry '' was a reference to a poem he had written for Morrissey .   `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out '' features lyrics drawn from `` Lonely Planet Boy '' by the New York Dolls . According to Marr : `` When we first played it , I thought it was the best song I 'd ever heard '' . The guitar part of `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out ' draws on the Rolling Stones cover of Marvin Gaye 's `` Hitch Hike '' , a song that , itself , was an inspiration for the Velvet Underground 's `` There She Goes Again '' .

Boxing was a popular spectator sport in Ancient Rome . In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped leather thongs around their fists . Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a weapon . The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestus which then led to a more sinister weapon called the myrmex ( 'limb piercer ' ) . Fighting events were held at Roman Amphitheatres . The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events . However , especially in later times , purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities , and their lives were not given up without due consideration . Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor . This is where the term ring came from . In AD 393 , during the Roman gladiator period , boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality . It was not until the late 17th century that boxing re-surfaced in London .   Early London prize ring rules   Records of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western Roman Empire when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned . However , there are detailed records of various fist-fighting sports that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries . There was also a sport in ancient Rus called Kulachniy Boy or `` Fist Fighting '' .   As the wearing of swords became less common , there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists . The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of bare-knuckle boxing sometimes referred to as prizefighting . The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the London Protestant Mercury , and the first English bare-knuckle champion was James Figg in 1719 . This is also the time when the word `` boxing '' first came to be used . It should be noted , that this earliest form of modern boxing was very different . Contests in Mr. Figg 's time , in addition to fist fighting , also contained fencing and cudgeling .

By the 12th century , a team ball game called ' or ' , akin to a chaotic version of hockey or football ( depending on whether sticks were used ) , was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes ; it was attested in Cornwall as early as 1283 .   In the book Queen of Games : The History of Croquet , Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet , which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas .   The first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to Britain from France during the 1630\u20131685 reign of Charles II of England , and was played under the name of ' ( among other spellings , today usually pall-mall ) , derived ultimately from Latin words for ' '' ball and mallet ' ( the latter also found in the name of the earlier French game , ' ) . This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica , dated 1877 . In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England , Joseph Strutt , in 1611 , described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time : `` Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box [ wood ] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron , which he that can do at the fewest blows , or at the number agreed upon , wins . It is to be observed , that there are two of these arches , that is one at either end of the alley . The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second , and the walk in Saint James 's Park , now called the Mall , received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall , where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime . ''   While the name pall-mall and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere ( France and Italy ) , the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century . Some other early modern sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance ( as in golf ) , however an image in Strutt 's 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game ( balls on ground , hoop , bats and peg ) being played over a , garden-sized distance . The image 's caption describes the game as `` a curious ancient pastime '' , confirming that croquet games were not new in early nineteenth century England .   In Samuel Johnson 's 1755 dictionary , his definition of `` pall-mall '' clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet : `` A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring '' . However , there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game .   The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from Ireland during the 1850s , perhaps after being brought there from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches . Regular contact between Ireland and France had continued since the Norman invasion of Ireland in", "modContext": "A croquet is a sport that involves hitting plastic or wooden balls with sledgehammers through hoops, known as \"wicket\" in the United States.In November 1856, Isaac Spratt registered a set of rules with the Stationers' Company in London, which contained information about the modern game of croquet, making it the oldest document to do so.The Public Record Office has taken possession of this record.The All England Croquet Club was established in Wimbledon, London, the same year that Moreton-in-Marsh held the first all-comers' meet for croquet in 1868.Crocket, a form that has been commonly used since ancient times, was eventually introduced to England and the British colonies. It is similar to ground billiards in Western Europe, where it originated from classical antiquity and sometimes involved striking objects such as arches, pegs, balls, and mallets, much like field hockey sticks.In the 12th century, a team ball game called \"or\" was played in France and southern Britain, with players sharing games like football or hockey.Cornwall has attested it as early as 1283.The origins of croquet, which became a sensation in England during the 1860s and later spread internationally, are explained by Nicky Smith in her book Queen of Games: The History of Croquet.It is believed that the game's ancestor was brought to Britain from France during the reign of Charles II of England in 1630-1685 and was named \"Pall-mall,\" a name that has been linked to the Latin word for \"ball and mallet,\" which is also present in the French game.The ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica provided an explanation for this in 1877.In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, Joseph Strutt detailed the game of pall-maille in England as a ball hit with ice. The winner is determined by the player who strikes the ball with the least amount or most powerful iron mallet.It should be noted that there are two arches located at either end of the alley.The game of mall was a popular pastime during Charles the Second's reign, and the Mall Walk in Saint James' Park was named after its purpose of entertaining visitors who played it frequently.Despite the presence of pall-mall names and games with similar names in other countries like France and Italy, the description above implies that croquet-style games were prevalent in England by the early 1600s.In some of the early modern sources, a pall-mall game played over an extensive range is mentioned, but Strutt's 1801 book portrays billiard-style ground gameplay with balls on the field, bats, and peg.The image's caption identifies croquet games as an unusual ancient pastime, emphasizing that they were not new in England during the early 1800s.Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary defines a game called pall-mall, which is similar to modern croquet in that involves hitting the ball through an iron ring.There is no proof that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke, which is the defining trait of modern sport.The second hypothesis suggests that the principles behind the modern croquet game were introduced in Ireland during the 1850s, possibly by being transported from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches.", "question": "which creatures are used as croquet balls in the novel \u2018alice\u2019s adventures in wonderland\u2019?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "Flamingos and hedgehogs.", "modAnswer": "Hedgehogs and flamingos.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[4, 0.49277523159980774], [7, 0.49117904901504517], [0, 0.4797405004501343], [16, 0.4710271656513214], [14, 0.44198888540267944], [15, 0.4417187571525574], [13, 0.4272106885910034], [17, 0.41416993737220764], [10, 0.38601458072662354], [18, 0.37101107835769653], [1, 0.3599899113178253], [8, 0.3102809190750122], [12, 0.26281923055648804], [5, 0.25289615988731384], [3, 0.23893161118030548], [9, 0.18699270486831665], [11, 0.11350563913583755], [6, 0.08848953247070312], [2, -0.0452466644346714]]}, {"test case number": 40, "context": "The Uzbeks ( O\u02bbzbek/\u040e\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a , pl .

They comprise the majority population of Uzbekistan but are also found as a minority group in Afghanistan , Tajikistan , Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan , Russia and China . Uzbek diaspora communities also exist in Turkey , Saudi Arabia , and Pakistan .   Etymology   The origin of the word Uzbek remains disputed . One view holds that it is eponymously named after Oghuz Khagan , also known as Oghuz Beg , became the word Uzbek .  Another states that the name means independent or the lord itself , from O\u02bbz ( self ) and the Turkic title Bek/Bey/Beg . There is another theory which holds that the pronunciation of Uz comes from one of the Oghuz Turks variously known as Uz or Uguz united with the word Bey or Bek to form uguz-bey , meaning `` leader of an oguz '' .   Origins   Before , 5th century , what is today 's Uzbekistan was part of Sogdia , mainly inhabited by Sogdians , an Indo-Iranian people . It was part of the Achaemenid Empire and later part of Sasanian Empire . From 5th to 6th century , what is today 's Uzbekistan was part of the Hephthalite Empire . From 6th to 8th century , what is today 's Uzbekistan was under the rule of G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khanate . Turkic and Chinese migration into central Asia occurred during the Chinese Tang Dynasty , and Chinese armies commanded by Turkic generals stationed in large parts of central Asia . But Chinese influence ended with the An Lushan rebellion . From the 9th century on , Transoxania was under the rule of Turkic Kara-Khanid Khanate , their arrival in Transoxania signalled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia . Kara-Khanid ruler Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan was the first Turkic ruler to convert Islam , most people of Central Asia soon followed . In the 12th century , Transoxania was conquered by Qara Khitai ( Western Liao ) , a sinicized Khitan dynasty , they brought to Central Asia the Chinese system of government . In the 13th century , Kara-Khanid Khanate was destroyed by the Turkic Khwarazmian dynasty , a vassal of the Qara Khitai .   Although Turko-Mongol infiltration into Central Asia had started early , as late as the 13th century when Turkic and Mongol armies finally conquered the entire region , the majority of Central Asia 's peoples were Iranian peoples such as Sogdians , Bactrians and , more ancient , the Saka\u2013Massagetae tribes . It is generally believed that these ancient Indo-European-speaking peoples were linguistically assimilated by smaller but dominant Turkic-speaking groups while the sedentary population finally adopted the Persian language , the traditional lingua franca of the eastern Islamic lands . The language-shift from Middle Iranian to Turkic and New Persian was predominantly the result of an elite dominance process . This process was dramatically boosted during the Mongol conquest when millions were either killed or pushed further south to the Pamir region .   The modern Uzbek language is largely derived from the Chagatai language which gained prominence in the Timurid Empire . The position of Chagatai ( and later Uzbek ) was further strengthened after the fall of the Timurids and the rise of the Shaybanid Uzbek Khaqanate that finally shaped the Turkic language and identity of modern Uzbeks , while the unique grammatical and phonetical features of the Uzbek language as well as the modern Uzbek culture reflect the more ancient Iranian roots of the Uzbek people .   Genetic origins   The modern Uzbek population represents varying degrees of diversity derived from the high traffic invasion routes through Central Asia . Once populated by Iranian tribes and other Indo-European people , Central Asia experienced numerous invasions emanating out of Mongolia that would drastically affect the region . According to recent genetic genealogy testing from a University of Oxford study , the genetic admixture of the Uzbeks clusters somewhere between the Iranian peoples and the Mongols .   From the 3d century B.C. , Central Asia experienced nomadic expansions of Altaic-speaking oriental-looking people , and their incursions continued for hundreds of years , beginning with the Hsiung-Nu ( who may be ancestors of the Huns ) , in ~300 B.C. , and followed by the Turks , in the 1st millennium A.D. , and the Mongol expansions of the 13th century . High levels of haplogroup 10 [ C-M130 ] and its derivative , haplogroup 36 [ C-M210 ] , are found in most of the Altaic-speaking populations and are a good indicator of the genetic impact",

the people living in Uzbekistan are a minority in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Russia, and China.Uzbek diaspora communities can be found in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan as well.The etymology of the word Uzbek is still debated.According to one perspective, the name is derived from Oghuz Khagan, also known as Ogguzz Beg, who later became the term Uzbek.The name is said to signify self-sufficient or the lord itself, according to another source, derived from Oz and the Turkic words Bek/Bey/Beg.Another theory suggests that the way Uz is pronounced can be traced back to one of the Oghuz Turks, who were also known as Uxqab or Ugguz, but they combined the words Bey and Bek to create uguzz-bey, which means \"leader of an OG.The Indo-Iranian people of Sogdia, who were the primary inhabitants of what is now Uzbekistan, were present before the 5th century when it came under its own name.It was a constituent of the Achaemenid Empire and later, the Sasanian Empire.Uzbekistan was a part of the Hephthalite Empire from the 5th to the 6th century.Uzbekistan was under the rule of G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khanate from the 6th to the 8th century.During the Chinese Tang Dynasty, Turkic and Chinese troops moved into much of central Asia, while military forces led by Turkish commanders were stationed in various regions.The An Lushan rebellion marked the end of Chinese influence.Transoxania was under the control of the Turkic Kara-Khanid Khanate from the 9th century, and their arrival signaled a clear shift from Iranian to Turkish supremacy in Central Asia.Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, a Kara-Khanid ruler, was the first Turkic ruler to convert to Islam, and it was soon followed by most of Central Asia.Qara Khitai, a western Liao dynasty, conquered Transoxania in the 12th century and introduced the Chinese government system to Central Asia.The Kara-Khanid Khanate was destroyed by the Turkic Khwarazmian dynasty, a vassal of the Qara Khitai, in the 13th century.Despite the fact that the Turkic and Mongol armies had already invaded Central Asia by the 13th century, Iranian peoples like Sogdians, Bactrians or Saka-Massagetae tribes still made up the majority of Central Asian populations.The general consensus is that the ancient Indo-European speakers were assimilated by smaller but powerful Turkic-speaking groups, and the sedentary population eventually adopted the Persian language, which is considered the common language of eastern Islam.The shift from Middle Iranian to Turkic and New Persian was mainly due to an elite dominance process.During the Mongol conquest, the process experienced a significant boost as millions of people were either killed or forced to relocate southward to the Pamir region.The Chagatai language, which became prevalent in the Timurid Empire, is largely responsible for the development of the modern Uzbek language.With the fall of the Timurids and the emergence of Shaybanid Uzbek Khaqanate, the status of Chagatai and U.S. was strengthened, and this led to the development of modern Uzi language and culture that mirrored the ancient Iranian roots.The genetic makeup of the contemporary Uzbek population is diverse and influenced by the high volume of traffic entering Central Asia.In the past, Mongolia was home to Iranian tribes and other Indo-European peoples, but Central Asia experienced frequent invasions that had a significant impact on the region.A genetic genealogy study conducted by the University of Oxford has revealed that the Uzbeks' clusters are located somewhere between the Iranian peoples and the Mongols.Beginning in the 3rd century B.C.The nomadic expansion of Central Asia was characterized by the presence of Altaic-speaking oriental-looking peoples, who began in approximately 300 B and continued their invasions for hundreds of years.C.The Turks came after in the 1st millennium A.D.The Mongol expansion of the 13th

keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands . Invented in about 1700 ( the exact date is uncertain ) , the piano is widely employed in classical , jazz , traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances , accompaniment , and for composing and rehearsal . Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones . With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed . The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced .   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments . The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe . During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings . By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key . Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case , soundboard , bridge , and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings .   Invention   The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori ( 1655\u20131731 ) of Padua , Italy , who was employed by Ferdinando de ' Medici , Grand Prince of Tuscany , as the Keeper of the Instruments ; he was an expert harpsichord maker , and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments . It is", "modContext": "Musical instruments such as the piano utilize a keyboard, which is composed of alternating rows of keys that are played by the performer using both hands.The piano, which was invented in 1700, is commonly used in classical, jazz, traditional, and popular music for solo and ensemble performances, accompaniment, as well as for composing and rehearsal.Despite its limited mobility and high cost, the piano's versatility, chord-playing capabilities, and widespread use in performance venues and rehearsal rooms have made it a well-known musical instrument in the Western world.Typically, an acoustic piano is enclosed by  protective wooden casings and metal strings, with 88 black and white keys distributed over 12 different scales. The C Major scale has 52 white key keys, while the Black Keys have 36 shorter lengths to accommodate the \"accidental\" notes needed to play in all 12 modes.Pressing or striking the keys causes the strings to be sounded, and when they are released, a damper is used to silence them.The use of pedals at the base of the instrument enables the notes to be sustained, even when the keys are not in use.While the pipe organ and harpsichord were previously considered major keyboard instruments, the dynamics and tone of these instruments are altered by how much weight or force is applied by the performer to press or strike the keys.The piano's keyboard causes a padded hammer, often with strong felt padding, to hit the strings when one or more keys are pressed.The strings are released by the hammer, and they continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency.A bridge links the vibrations to a soundboard, which enhances their quality by better coupling coustic energy to the air.A damper is used to cancel the sound caused by the strings when the key is released.An acoustic piano with strings is commonly classified as percussion rather than stringed due to its being struck instead of plucked, unlike some harpsichord or spinet instruments.The Hornbostel-Sachs system categorizes instruments and classifies them as chordophones, including pianos.Technological progress has led to the creation of electric, electronic, and digital pianos.Jazz fusion and rock music in the 1960s and 1970s saw an increase in popularity of the electric piano.The term piano is a contraction of the Italian word for instrument, pianoforte, which is composed of gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano.Italian musical terms for piano and forte refer to the variations in sound produced by a pianist touching the keys, with higher velocity and stronger force being used to produce different sounds.Earlier technological advancements in keyboard instruments served as the foundation for the piano's development.The Middle Ages in Europe saw the emergence of hammered dulcimers, which were the first string instruments with struck strings.During the Middle Ages, there were numerous efforts to produce keyboard instruments that utilized struck strings.The 17th century saw the well-developed mechanisms of keyboard instruments, including the clavichord and harpsichorald.The strings of a clavichord are struck by tangents, while those of the harpsichored are mechanically plucked by quills when the key is depressed.The harpsichord's mechanism had been studied for centuries, leading to the identification of optimal methods for creating a keyboard case, soundboard, bridge, and mechanical action.Bartolomeo Cristofori, who worked as the Keeper of the Instruments for Ferdinando de'Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany and lived in Padua, Italy, is credited with inventing the modern piano.He had a skillful background in making harpsichords and was well-versed in the field of stringed keyboard instruments.", "question": "whose 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'apassionata'?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "Ludwig van Beethoven's 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'Appassionata'.", "modAnswer": "Beethoven's.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[15, 0.48250624537467957], [23, 0.45865607261657715], [1, 0.4305450916290283], [12, 0.39725780487060547], [2, 0.3701951503753662], [0, 0.35260793566703796], [16, 0.3464506268501282], [20, 0.3371580243110657], [14, 0.33261585235595703], [22, 0.3164258301258087], [17, 0.31336265802383423], [3, 0.30106353759765625], [6, 0.2804982662200928], [11, 0.2786175012588501], [24, 0.26984909176826477], [5, 0.26361680030822754], [13, 0.22052223980426788], [19, 0.21746355295181274], [21, 0.2053416520357132], [7, 0.16718736290931702], [18, 0.13368132710456848], [9, 0.1288168579339981], [10, 0.10632219910621643], [4, 0.10233736038208008], [8, -0.010603858157992363]]}, {"test case number": 44, "context": "Beaujolais nouveau is a red wine made from Gamay grapes produced in the Beaujolais region of France .

History   Beaujolais had always made a vin de l'ann\u00e9e to celebrate the end of the harvest , but until WWII it was only for local consumption . In fact , once the Beaujolais AOC was established in 1937 , AOC rules meant that Beaujolais wine could only be officially sold after 15 December in the year of harvest . Warning - plays music by default These rules were relaxed on 13 November 1951 , and the Union Interprofessionnelle des Vins du Beaujolais ( UIVB ) formally set 15 November as the release date for what would henceforth be known as Beaujolais nouveau .   A few members of the UIVB saw the potential for marketing Beaujolais nouveau . Not only was it a way to clear lots of vin ordinaire at a good profit , but selling wine within weeks of the harvest was great for cash flow .

The grapes must come from the Beaujolais AOC , with those of the ten `` cru '' appellations excluded . They are grown in `` stony , schistous soils '' . Both Beaujolais Nouveau and Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau are produced ; the latter comes from the ~ 30 non-cru villages in the region .   By law , all grapes in the region must be harvested by hand . The wine is made using carbonic maceration , whole berry anaerobic fermentation which emphasizes fruit flavors without extracting bitter tannins from the grape skins . Grapes are loaded into a large ( think 20,000 gallon ) sealed container that is filled with carbon dioxide . Grapes that are gently crushed at the bottom of the container by the weight of the grapes start to ferment , emitting more CO2 . All this carbon dioxide causes fermentation to take place inside the uncrushed grapes ( without access to oxygen , hence `` anaerobic fermentation '' ) . The resulting wine is fresh , fruity , and very low in tannins .   Celebration    This `` Beaujolais Day '' is accompanied by publicity events and heavy advertising . The traditional slogan , even in English-speaking countries , was `` Le Beaujolais nouveau est arriv\u00e9 !

In the United States , it is promoted as a drink for Thanksgiving , which always falls exactly one week after the wine is released ( on the fourth Thursday of November ) . Many producers release the nouveau with colourful or abstract design that changes every year , usually as an evolution from the previous year 's design . Duboeuf has silk ties made each year with their label 's abstract design , and releases them through select wholesalers and distributors .   Style   Beaujolais nouveau is a purple-pink wine reflecting its youth , bottled only 6-8 weeks after harvest .

Par-3 courses consist of nine or eighteen holes all of which have a par of three strokes .   Many older courses are links , often coastal . Courses are private , public , and municipally owned , and typically feature a pro shop . Many private courses are found at country clubs .   Design   Although a specialty within landscape design or landscape architecture , golf course architecture is considered a separate field of study . Some golf course architects become celebrities in their own right , such as Robert Trent Jones , Jr. ; others are professional golfers of high standing and demonstrated appreciation for golf course composition , notably Jack Nicklaus . The field is partially represented by the American Society of Golf Course Architects , the European Institute of Golf Course Architects , and the Society of Australian Golf Course Architects , though many of the finest golf course architects in the world choose not to become members of any such group , as associations of architects are not government-sanctioned licensing bodies , but private groups .   While golf courses often follow the original landscape , some modification is unavoidable . This is increasingly the case as new courses are more likely to be sited on less optimal land . Bunkers and sand traps are almost always artificial , although other hazards may be natural .   The layout of a fairway follows certain traditional principles , such as the number of holes ( nine and eighteen being most common ) , their par values , and the number of holes of each par value per course . It is also preferable to arrange greens to be close to the tee box of the next playable hole , to minimize travel distance while playing a round , and to vary the mix of shorter and longer holes . Combined with the need to package all the fairways within what is frequently a compact square or rectangular plot of land , the fairways of a course tend to form an oppositional tiling pattern . In complex areas , two holes may share the same tee box , fairway , or even green . It is also common for separate tee-off points to be positioned for men , women , and amateurs , each one respectively lying closer to the green . Eighteen-hole courses are traditionally broken down into a `` front 9 '' ( holes 1-9 ) and a `` back 9 '' ( holes 10-18 ) . On older courses ( especially links courses , like the Old Course at St. Andrews ) , the holes may be laid out in one long loop , beginning and ending at the clubhouse , and thus the front 9 is referred to on the scorecard as `` out '' ( heading out away from clubhouse ) and the back 9 as `` in '' ( heading back in toward the clubhouse ) . More recent courses ( and especially inland courses ) tend to be designed with the front 9 and the back 9 each constituting a separate loop beginning and ending at the clubhouse . This is partly for the convenience of the players and the club , as then it is easier to play just a 9-hole round , if preferred , or stop at the clubhouse for a snack between the front 9 and the back 9 .   A successful design is as visually pleasing as it is playable . With golf being a form of outdoor recreation , the strong designer is an adept student of natural landscaping who understands the aesthetic cohesion of vegetation , water bodies , paths , grasses , stonework , and woodwork , among other elements .

it is important to note that these organizations are not government-approved licensing bodies but private entities.Golf courses typically maintain their original surroundings, but there is always a possibility of modification.The likelihood of new courses being built on less desirable terrain is increasing.While there may be natural hazards, bunkers and sand traps are typically artificial.The design of a fairway adheres to specific established guidelines, including the number of holes (often nine and eighteen), their par values, and the count of each par value per course.It is more advantageous to arrange the greens near the tee box of the next playable hole to minimize travel distance and to vary the combination of shorter and longer holes.The combination of a compact square or rectangular land area and the need to pack all the fairways together results in an oppositional pattern on the course.In intricate regions, two holes may be situated on the same tee box, fairway, or green.Typically, men, women, and amateurs are assigned to have their own tee-off locations, with each player lying closer to the green.Eighteen-hole courses are commonly divided into two groups: the  front 9 (9-1-9), the \"back 9\" (9-10-18).Especially older courses, such as the Old Course at St.Andrews' layout involves the placement of holes in a loop, with the front nine being labeled as \"

Second Boer War ( , , literally `` Second Freedom War '' ) otherwise known as the Second Anglo-Boer War or the South African War , started on 11 October 1899 and ended on 31 May 1902 . The United Kingdom fought the South African Republic ( Transvaal Republic ) and the Orange Free State . The British war effort was supported by troops from several regions of the British Empire , including Southern Africa , the Australian colonies , Canada , Newfoundland , British India , and New Zealand . The war ended in victory for the British and the annexation of both republics . Both would eventually be incorporated into the Union of South Africa in 1910 .   Name   The conflict is commonly referred to as simply the Boer War , since the First Boer War ( December 1880 to March 1881 ) is much less well known . `` Boer '' was the common term for Afrikaans-speaking settlers in southern Africa at the time . It is also known as the South African War outside South Africa and as the ( Second ) Anglo-Boer War among South Africans . In Afrikaans it may be called the Anglo-Boereoorlog ( `` Anglo-Boer War '' ) , Tweede Boereoorlog ( `` Second Boer War '' ) , Tweede Vryheidsoorlog ( `` Second Freedom War '' , i.e. , a war of liberation ) or Engelse oorlog ( `` English War '' ) . In South Africa it is officially called the South African War .   Origins   The complex origins of the war resulted from more than a century of conflict between the Boers and the British Empire , but of particular immediate importance was the question as to which nation would control and benefit most from the very lucrative Witwatersrand gold mines . During the Napoleonic Wars , a British military expedition landed in the Cape Colony and defeated the defending Dutch forces at the Battle of Blaauwberg ( 1806 ) . After the war , the British formally acquired the colony ( 1814 ) , and encouraged immigration by British settlers who were largely at odds with the Dutch settlers . Many Boers who were dissatisfied with aspects of British administration , in particular with Britain 's abolition of slavery on 1 December 1834 , elected to migrate away from British rule in what became known as the Great Trek .   The Trekkers initially followed the eastern coast towards Natal and then , after Britain annexed the Natal in 1843 , journeyed northwards towards the interior . There they established two independent Boer republics : the South African Republic ( 1852 ; also known as the Transvaal Republic ) and the Orange Free State ( 1854 ) . The British recognised the two Boer republics in 1852 and 1854 , but attempted British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 led to the First Boer War in 1880\u201381 . After the British suffered defeats , particularly at the Battle of Majuba Hill ( 1881 ) , the independence of the two republics was restored subject to certain conditions ; relations , however , remained uneasy .   In 1866 Erasmus Jacobs discovered diamonds at Kimberley , prompting a diamond rush and a massive influx of foreigners to the borders of the Orange Free State . Then in 1886 , an Australian discovered gold in the Witwatersrand area of the South African Republic . Gold made the Transvaal the richest and potentially the most powerful nation in southern Africa ; however , the country had neither the manpower nor the industrial base to develop the resource on its own . As a result , the Transvaal reluctantly acquiesced to the immigration of uitlanders ( foreigners ) , mainly from Britain , who came to the Boer region in search of fortune and employment . This resulted in the number of uitlanders in the Transvaal potentially exceeding the number of Boers , and precipitated confrontations between the earlier-arrived Boer settlers and the newer , non-Boer arrivals .   British expansionist ideas ( notably propagated by Cecil Rhodes ) as well as disputes over uitlander political and economic rights resulted in the failed Jameson Raid of 1895 . Dr. Leander Starr Jameson , who led the raid , intended to encourage an uprising of the uitlanders in Johannesburg . However , the uitlanders did not take up arms in support , and Transvaal government forces surrounded the column and captured Jameson 's men before they could reach Johannesburg .

was popular among Boers who were dissatisfied with certain aspects of British governance, particularly the abolishment of slavery on December 1, 1834.After pursuing the eastern coast towards Natal, the Trekkers moved northward towards the interior after Britain's acquisition of the region in 1843.In 1852, the South African Republic was founded and two Boer republics were created.The Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State ( 1854) are also recognized as these locations.In 1852 and 1854, the British acknowledged both Boer republics, but their attempt to annex the Transvaal in 1877 resulted in the First Boar War in 1800-1881.In the aftermath of British defeats, particularly in the Battle of Majuba Hill (1881), the two republics were able to restore their independence on certain conditions.The relations remained uneasy.The discovery of diamonds at Kimberley by Erasmus Jacobs in 1866 led to a massive wave of foreigners moving to the Orange Free State.The discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand area of the South African Republic was made by an Australian in 1886.The Transvaal's gold wealth has made it the richest and potentially most powerful country in southern Africa;The country lacked the necessary manpower and industrial base to develop the resource independently.The Transvaal reluctantly accepted the arrival of a significant number of foreigners, mostly from Britain, who came to the Boer region in search of wealth and employment.The Transvaal may have had a higher number of uitlanders than Boers, leading to confrontations between the earlier-arrived Boer settlers and the newer non-Boer arrivals.The Jameson Raid of 1895 was a failure due to the influence of British expansionist ideas, particularly those championed by Cecil Rhodes, and disagreements over political and economic rights in the Netherlands.Dr.Leander Starr Jameson, the mastermind behind the raid, aimed to incite a rebellion of native Johannesburg inhabitants.Despite this, the uitlanders did not take up arms in support, and the Transvaal government forces surrounded the column and captured Jameson's men before they could reach Johannesburg.", "question": "which south

England are currently ranked fourth in Tests , fifth in ODIs and fifth in T20Is by the ICC .   History   The first recorded incidence of a team with a claim to represent England comes from 9 July 1739 when an `` All-England '' team , which consisted of 11 gentlemen from any part of England exclusive of Kent , played against `` the Unconquerable County '' of Kent and lost by a margin of `` very few notches '' . Such matches were repeated on numerous occasions for the best part of a century .   In 1846 William Clarke formed the All-England Eleven . This team would eventually compete against a United All-England Eleven with annual matches occurring between 1847 and 1856 . These matches were arguably the most important contest of the English season if judged by the quality of the players .   Early tours   The first overseas tour occurred in September 1859 with England touring North America . This team had six players from the All-England Eleven , six from the United All-England Eleven and was captained by George Parr .   With the outbreak of the American Civil War , attention turned elsewhere . English tourists visited Australia in 1861-62 with this first tour organised as a commercial venture by Messrs Spiers and Pond , restaurateurs of Melbourne . Most matches played during tours prior to 1877 were `` against odds '' , with the opposing team fielding more than 11 players to make for a more even contest . This first Australian tour were mostly against odds of at least 18/11 .   The tour was so successful that George Parr led a second tour in 1863\u201364 . James Lillywhite led a subsequent England team which sailed on the P & O steamship Poonah on 21 September 1876 . They would play a combined Australian XI , for once on even terms of 11 a side . The match , starting on 15 March 1877 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground came to be regarded as the inaugural Test match . The combined Australian XI won this Test match by 45 runs with Charles Bannerman of Australia scoring the first Test century . At the time , the match was promoted as James Lillywhite 's XI v Combined Victoria and New South Wales . The teams played a return match on the same ground at Easter , 1877 , when Lillywhite 's team avenged their loss with a victory by four wickets .

The more general term computer-generated imagery encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images , while computer animation only refers to the moving images . Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics , although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic , low bandwidth , and faster real-time renderings . Sometimes , the target of the animation is the computer itself , but sometimes film as well .   Computer animation is essentially a digital successor to the stop motion techniques used in traditional animation with 3D models and frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations . Computer-generated animations are more controllable than other more physically based processes , constructing miniatures for effects shots or hiring extras for crowd scenes , and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology . It can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors , expensive set pieces , or props . To create the illusion of movement , an image is displayed on the computer monitor and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to it , but advanced slightly in time ( usually at a rate of 24 or 30 frames/second ) . This technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with television and motion pictures .   For 3D animations , objects ( models ) are built on the computer monitor ( modeled ) and 3D figures are rigged with a virtual skeleton . For 2D figure animations , separate objects ( illustrations ) and separate transparent layers are used with or without that virtual skeleton . Then the limbs , eyes , mouth , clothes , etc . of the figure are moved by the animator on key frames . The differences in appearance between key frames are automatically calculated by the computer in a process known as tweening or morphing . Finally , the animation is rendered .   For 3D animations , all frames must be rendered after the modeling is complete . For 2D vector animations , the rendering process is the key frame illustration process , while tweened frames are rendered as needed . For pre-recorded presentations , the rendered frames are transferred to a different format or medium , like digital video . The frames may also be rendered in real time as they are presented to the end-user audience . Low bandwidth animations transmitted via the internet ( e.g . Adobe Flash , X3D ) often use software on the end-users computer to render in real time as an alternative to streaming or pre-loaded high bandwidth animations .   Explanation   To trick the eye and the brain into thinking they are seeing a smoothly moving object , the pictures should be drawn at around 12 frames per second or faster . ( A frame is one complete image . ) With rates above 75-120 frames per second , no improvement in realism or smoothness is perceivable due to the way the eye and the brain both process images . At rates below 12 frames per second , most people can detect jerkiness associated with the drawing of new images that detracts from the illusion of realistic movement . Conventional hand-drawn cartoon animation often uses 15 frames per second in order to save on the number of drawings needed , but this is usually accepted because of the stylized nature of cartoons . To produce more realistic imagery , computer animation demands higher frame rates .   Films seen in theaters in the United States run at 24 frames per second , which is sufficient to create the illusion of continuous movement . For high resolution , adapters are used .   History   Early digital computer animation was developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1960s by Edward E. Zajac , Frank W. Sinden , Kenneth C. Knowlton , and A. Michael Noll . Other digital animation was also practiced at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .   An early step in the history of computer animation was the sequel to the 1973 film Westworld , a science-fiction film about a society in which robots live and work among humans . The sequel , Futureworld ( 1976 ) , used the 3D wire-frame imagery , which featured a computer-animated hand and face both created by University of Utah graduates Edwin Catmull and Fred Parke .

utilized to transport water.An unimproved river has a series of channels called A navigation, which run parallel to its valley and stream bed.The river's drainage basin is always shared by navigation.The vessel navigates the still areas of the river and enhances, navigating through the same alteration in elevation.A true canal is a channel that crosses dividing drainage lines, creating directional connectivity between two separate drainage basins.In the first half of the 1800s, most commercially significant canals were a combination of both types, with rivers being used for extended distances and divide-crossing channels in other areas.Many canals that are still in use today meet this standard.To improve navigation, artificial waterways and canals use engineered structures such as weirs and dams to raise river levels to usable levels.Making looping cuts to create a gentler, longer channel around cliffs or falls;* Establishments to enable ships and barges to move up or down.Canals are more challenging to construct because they cross drainage divides and require additional improvements such as viaducts, aqueduct bridges over streams, roads, and ways to keep water in

lies in their contribution to commerce and the advancement, flourishing, and vitality of a society.The numbers that were once the backbone of 17th-20th century industries and economies are now only surviving as modern canals.Today, the bulk cargo and large ship transportation sectors are the only uses for surviving canals, while inland boat and barge canal have been replaced by faster and cheaper railways first, followed by flexibility and slope climbing capabilities offered by lorries.Construction canals can be built using one of three methods, or a combination of the three depending

using building materials such as dirt, stone, and concrete to create either the body of water or the sides of the canal.Water that is supplied to the canal must be sourced from an outside source, such as streams or reservoirs.Elevation engineering works such as locks, lifts, or elevators that raise and lower vessels must be changed in the new waterway.Canals, such as the Canal du Midi, Canal de Briare, and the Panama Canal, connect valleys that rise above a higher body of land.A canal can be created by dredging the bottom of an already existing lake.The lake is emptied and transformed into another canal when the channel is finished, providing for the drainage of the nearby polder and transportation.The list comprises of examples such as the.The construction of two parallel dikes in an

period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840 . This transition included going from hand production methods to machines , new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes , improved efficiency of water power , the increasing use of steam power , the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system . Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment , value of output and capital invested ; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods . The Industrial Revolution began in the United Kingdom and most of the important technological innovations were British .   The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history ; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way . In particular , average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth . Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history , although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries . At approximately the same time the Industrial Revolution was occurring , Britain was undergoing an agricultural revolution , which also helped to improve living standards .   Mechanised textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe in the early 19th century , with important centres in France . A major iron making centre developed in Belgium . Since then industrialisation has spread throughout the world . The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians , as is the pace of economic and social changes . GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy , while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies . Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants .   The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870 , when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport ( steam-powered railways , boats and ships ) , the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories .   Etymology   The earliest recorded use of the term `` Industrial Revolution '' seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto , announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise . In his 1976 book Keywords : A Vocabulary of Culture and Society , Raymond Williams states in the entry for `` Industry '' : `` The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen , between 1811 and 1818 , and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the [ 19th ] century . '' The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s , as in J\u00e9r\u00f4me-Adolphe Blanqui 's description in 1837 of la r\u00e9volution industrielle . Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of `` an industrial revolution , a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society '' . However , although Engels wrote in the 1840s , his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s , and his expression did not enter everyday language until then . Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee , whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term .   Some historians , such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts , have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer . This is still a subject of debate among historians .   Important technological developments   The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations , beginning in the second half of the 18th century . By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies :  * Textiles \u2013 Mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water greatly increased the output of a worker . The power loom increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40 . The cotton gin increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor", "modContext": "The Industrial Revolution was a period of altered manufacturing methods that occurred between approximately 1760 and 1840.The change involved embracing machines over manual labor, exploring new chemical manufacturing and iron production methods, improving water power efficiency, increasing steam power usage, developing machine tools, and expanding factory infrastructure.In terms of employment, output, and capital invested, textiles were the most significant industry during the Industrial Revolution.The textile industry was the first to adopt modern production methods.The United Kingdom was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, and its technological advancements were predominantly made by British companies.The Industrial Revolution was a pivotal moment in history;Practically every aspect of daily existence was impacted in some manner.The average income and population both saw an increase that was unprecedented and sustained.The standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently during the Industrial Revolution, as some economists argue, but it was not until the end of the 19th and 20th centuries that this trend became meaningful.The Industrial Revolution occurred around the same time as an agricultural revolution in Britain, which helped to improve living standards.Mechanized textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe in the early 19th century, with France being a significant hub.Belgium emerged as a major hub for the production of iron.Industrialisation has spread globally since then.The exact beginning and conclusion of the Industrial Revolution, as well as the speed of economic and social change, are still disputed by historians.Capitalist economies experienced per-capita economic growth after the Industrial Revolution, while GDP per capita remained relatively stable before the industrial revolution and the development of the modern capitalist economy.According to economic historians, the Industrial Revolution is widely regarded as the most significant event in human history since the domestication of animals and plants.The Second Industrial Revolution occurred during the transition period from 1840 to 1870, coinciding with the evolution of the First Industrial revolution into the Second industrial revolution, which was characterized by the growing use of steam transport, machine tools, and machinery in factories powered by steam.The earliest known usage of the term \"Industrial Revolution\" is traced back to a letter dated 6 July 1799 written by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto, declaring France's involvement in the industrial revolution.In his 1976 book Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society, Raymond Williams notes that the concept of a new social order with major industrial changes was implicit from Blake's time in the early 1790s to Wordsworth'S in late 19th century.J\u00e9r\u00f4me-Adolphe Blanqui's 1837 description of the Industrial Revolution, also known as la r\u00e9volution industrielle, demonstrated the increasing prevalence of this term for technological change by the late 1830s.Friedrich Engels' book, The Condition of the Working Class in England, published in 1844, discussed the industrial revolution that had a profound impact on civil society.Engels' book was written in the 1840s, but it was not until the late 1800s that his words were translated into English and entered common language.It is possible that Arnold Toynbee played a role in the term's popularity, as his 1881 lectures were informative and detailed on this topic.The term revolution has been criticized by historians like John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts, who argue that the economic changes were gradual and social.Historians are still in disagreement about this matter.The Industrial Revolution's inception was marked by a few technological advancements that began during the second half of the 18th century.Textiles and mechanised cotton spinning, powered by steam or water, were instrumental in achieving significant productivity increases for workers by the 1830s.The output of a worker was multiplied by more than 40 when the power loom was used.", "question": "name the leicester-born eponymous inspiration of the

The performance is typically given in an opera house , accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble , which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor .   Opera is part of the Western classical music tradition . It started in Italy at the end of the 16th century ( with Jacopo Peri 's lost Dafne , produced in Florence in 1598 ) and soon spread through the rest of Europe : Sch\u00fctz in Germany , Lully in France , and Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century . In the 18th century , Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe ( except France ) , attracting foreign composers such as Handel . Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera , until Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his `` reform '' operas in the 1760s . In the 2000s , the most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Mozart , who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas , especially The Marriage of Figaro ( Le Nozze Di Figaro ) , Don Giovanni , and Cos\u00ec fan tutte , as well as The Magic Flute ( Die Zauberfl\u00f6te ) , a landmark in the German tradition .

The mid-to-late 19th century was a `` golden age '' of opera , led and dominated by Wagner in Germany and Verdi in Italy . The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Puccini and Strauss in the early 20th century . During the 19th century , parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe , particularly in Russia and Bohemia . The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles , such as atonality and serialism ( Schoenberg and Berg ) , Neoclassicism ( Stravinsky ) , and Minimalism ( Philip Glass and John Adams ) . With the rise of recording technology , singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans .

Some composers , notably Richard Wagner , have written their own libretti ; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists , e.g . Mozart with Lorenzo Da Ponte . Traditional opera , often referred to as `` number opera '' , consists of two modes of singing : recitative , the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech , and aria ( an `` air '' or formal song ) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style .

Sch\u00fctz, Lully, and Purcell all played a role in establishing their respective national traditions in Europe during the 17th century.Italian opera was still prevalent in most of Europe during the 18th century, with the exception of France, which enticed foreign composers like Handel to study it.Until the 1760s, opera seria was the most esteemed type of Italian opera, but Gluck's \"reform\" operas challenged its artificiality.The late 18th-century opera's most popular figure in the 2000s was Mozart, who is best known for his Italian comic operas, such as The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Cos fan tutte, as well as a significant achievement in German literature, including The Magic Flute.Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini marked the peak of the bel canto style in the first third of 19th century, producing works that are still performed today.

After they formally teamed up in burlesque in 1936 , he and Costello continued to hone the sketch . It was a big hit in 1937 , when they performed the routine in a touring vaudeville revue called `` Hollywood Bandwagon '' .   In February 1938 , Abbott and Costello joined the cast of The Kate Smith Hour radio program , and the sketch was first performed for a national radio audience that March . The routine may have been further polished before this broadcast by burlesque producer John Grant , who became the team 's writer , and Will Glickman , a staff writer on the radio show . Glickman may have added the nicknames of then-contemporary baseball players like Dizzy and Daffy Dean to set up the routine 's premise . This version , with extensive wordplay based on the fact that most of the fictional baseball team 's players had `` strange nicknames '' that seemed to be questions , became known as `` Who 's on First ?

Abbott and Costello performed `` Who 's on First ? '' numerous times in their careers , rarely performing it exactly the same way twice . They did the routine for President Franklin Roosevelt several times . An abridged version was featured in the team 's 1940 film debut , One Night in the Tropics . The duo reprised the bit in their 1945 film The Naughty Nineties , and it is that longer version which is considered their finest recorded rendition . They also performed `` Who 's on First ?

Unlike the Summer Olympics , the Winter Olympics feature sports practiced on snow and ice . The first Winter Olympics , the 1924 Winter Olympics , was held in Chamonix , France . The original five sports ( broken into nine disciplines ) were bobsleigh , curling , ice hockey , Nordic skiing ( consisting of the disciplines military patrol , cross-country skiing , Nordic combined , and ski jumping ) , and skating ( consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating ) . The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936 , after which they were interrupted by World War II . The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years . Until 1992 , the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years , but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years , the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994 .   The Winter Games have evolved since its inception . Sports and disciplines have been added and some of them , such as Alpine skiing , luge , short track speed skating , freestyle skiing , skeleton , and snowboarding , have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic program . Others ( such as curling and bobsleigh ) have been discontinued and later reintroduced , or have been permanently discontinued ( such as military patrol , though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it ) . Still others , such as speed skiing , bandy and skijoring , were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports . The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced the profile of the Games . It created an income stream , via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising , which has become lucrative for the IOC . This allowed outside interests , such as television companies and corporate sponsors , to exert influence . The IOC has had to address several criticisms , internal scandals , the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians , as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics . Nations have used the Winter Games to showcase the claimed superiority of their political systems .   The Winter Olympics has been hosted on three continents by eleven different countries . The United States has hosted the Games four times ( 1932 , 1960 , 1980 , 2002 ) ; France has been the host three times ( 1924 , 1968 , 1992 ) ; Austria ( 1964 , 1976 ) , Canada ( 1988 , 2010 ) , Japan ( 1972 , 1998 ) , Italy ( 1956 , 2006 ) , Norway ( 1952 , 1994 ) , and Switzerland ( 1928 , 1948 ) have hosted the Games twice . Germany ( 1936 ) , Yugoslavia ( 1984 ) , and Russia ( 2014 ) have hosted the Games once . The IOC has selected Pyeongchang , South Korea , to host the 2018 Winter Olympics and Beijing , China , to host the 2022 Winter Olympics . No country in the southern hemisphere has hosted or even been an applicant to host the Winter Olympics ; the major challenge preventing one hosting the games is the dependence on winter weather , and the traditional February timing of the games falls in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer .

This led to the subsequent Winter Olympics in 1994.The Winter Games have undergone changes since their inception.Alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, freestyle skiing (extreme cross-country skiing), skeleton, and snowboarding are just a few of the disciplines that have been added to the Olympic program.Certain Winter Olympic activities, including curling and bobsleigh, have either been discontinued or permanently abandoned, such as military patrol, although biathlon is a derivative of these events.Speed skiing, bandy, and skijoring were among the demonstration sports that were never included in the Olympic games.The Games' image was heightened by the advent of television as a global communication platform.Through the sale of broadcast rights and advertising, the IOC generated a revenue stream that has proven to be profitable.Outsiders, such as television companies and corporate sponsors, were able to exert their influence.Several criticisms, internal scandals and the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians have led to the IOC's response to a political boycott of the Winter Olympics.The Winter Games have been utilized by nations to exhibit the supposed dominance of their political systems.Eleven countries have hosted the Winter Olympics on three continents.Throughout history, the Games have been held in the United States four times (1932), 1960, 1980, and 2002);France has hosted three times (1924, 1968, 1992);The Games have been held twice, with Austria, Canada, Japan, Italy, Norway, and Switzerland.The Games were previously hosted by Germany in 1936, Yugoslavia in 1984, and Russia in 2014.The IOC has chosen Pyeongchang, South Korea, as the location for the 2018 Winter Olympics and Beijing, China, to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games.The Winter Olympics have not been hosted or sought to be hosted by any southern country.Winter weather is the primary obstacle in keeping the games from being held, as the traditional February schedule falls during summer in the southern hemisphere.Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States have all sent athletes to participate in the Winter Olympic Games.Austria, Canada, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United States are the only countries that have won medals at every Winter Olympic Games, while the USA has only achieved gold.The Games have experienced a ban of both Germany and Japan on occasion.Only winter sports are restricted by the Olympic Charter.The.The.Which activities are carried out on snow or ice.The Olympic programme has seen the inclusion of several new sports since 1992.Short track speed skating, snowboarding, freestyle and moguls skiing are all part of the options.The Winter Olympics' popularity has risen beyond Europe and North America due to the introduction of these events.", "question": "which european country hosted the 1956 winter olympic games?", "groundTruth": "italy", "answer": "Italy.", "modAnswer": "Italy hosted the 1956 Winter Olympic Games.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[16, 0.5786430835723877], [24, 0.5726417303085327], [22, 0.5550636053085327], [19, 0.5334926247596741], [1, 0.5248454809188843], [20, 0.5200741291046143], [33, 0.5054417848587036], [25, 0.5052388310432434], [17, 0.49098140001296997], [15, 0.4882095456123352], [21, 0.4766960144042969], [2, 0.46653613448143005], [23, 0.4604586958885193], [6, 0.455049991607666], [27, 0.43552982807159424], [0, 0.4228516221046448], [7, 0.4035903513431549], [14, 0.40346717834472656], [5, 0.3939340114593506], [8, 0.3812195658683777], [18, 0.33346760272979736], [3, 0.3165999948978424], [31, 0.3122115731239319], [10, 0.3115631937980652], [30, 0.3061300218105316], [4, 0.2976149022579193], [9, 0.2874741852283478], [26, 0.2067553997039795], [32, 0.19481801986694336], [11, 0.14229698479175568], [12, 0.10775171220302582], [13, 0.05518079176545143], [28, 0.03333726525306702], [29, 0.03333726525306702]]}, {"test case number": 59, "context": "The date of the start of the history of the United States is a subject of debate among historians .

By the 1770s , thirteen British colonies contained two and a half million people along the Atlantic coast east of the Appalachian Mountains . In the 1760s , the British government imposed a series of new taxes while rejecting the American argument that any new taxes had to be approved by the people ( see Stamp Act 1765 ) . Tax resistance , especially the Boston Tea Party ( 1774 ) , led to punitive laws ( the Intolerable Acts ) by Parliament designed to end self-government in Massachusetts .

All thirteen colonies united in a Congress that called on them to write new state constitutions .

Those Patriot governments in the colonies unanimously empowered their delegates to Congress to declare independence . In 1776 , Congress declared that there was a new , independent nation , the United States of America , not just a collection of disparate colonies . With large-scale military and financial support from France and military leadership by General George Washington , the American Patriots rebelled against British rule and succeeded in the Revolutionary War .   The peace treaty of 1783 gave the new nation the land east of the Mississippi River ( except Florida and Canada , and Spain disputed the Mississippi Territory until 1795 ) and confirmed Great Britain 's recognition of the United States as a nation . The central government established by the Articles of Confederation proved ineffectual at providing stability , as it had no authority to collect taxes and had no executive officer . Congress called a convention to meet secretly in Philadelphia in 1787 to revise the Articles of Confederation . It wrote a new Constitution , which was adopted in 1789 . In 1791 , a Bill of Rights was added to guarantee inalienable rights . With Washington as the Union 's first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief political and financial adviser , a strong central government was created .

The Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom , which eventually spread throughout Italy , assimilating and conquering other nearby civilizations and forming the Roman Republic . Rome ultimately emerged as the dominant power , conquering much of the ancient world and becoming the leading cultural , political , and religious centre of Western civilisation .

As the 19th century gave way to the 20th , there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution , which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic , followed by the bloody Philippine\u2013American War of conquest by US military force . Aside from the period of Japanese occupation , the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II , when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation . Since then , the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy , which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution .   The nation 's large population and economic potential have led it to be classified as a middle power .

Spanish explorer Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of Leyte and Samar Felipinas after the then Prince of Asturias . Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago . Before that became commonplace , other names such as Islas del Poniente ( Islands of the West ) and Magellan 's name for the islands San L\u00e1zaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands .   The official name of the Philippines has changed several times in the course of its history . During the Philippine Revolution , the Malolos Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Rep\u00fablica Filipina or the Philippine Republic . From the period of the Spanish\u2013American War ( 1898 ) and the Philippine\u2013American War ( 1899\u20131902 ) until the Commonwealth period ( 1935\u201346 ) , American colonial authorities referred to the country as the Philippine Islands , a translation of the Spanish name . From the 1898 Treaty of Paris , the name Philippines began to appear and it has since become the country 's common name .

system comprises approximately 7,641 islands that are broadly categorized into three main geographical divisions, which are Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.The most populous city in the Philippines is Quezon City, and it is also the capital city of Manila, which is part of Metro Manila.The Philippines' location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and its proximity to the equator make it susceptible to earthquakes and typhoons, but also provide some of the world's most abundant biodiversity.With a population of over 100 million and an area of roughly 300000 km2, the Philippines has one of the fastest-growing nations in Asia.The country's population ranks seventh in Asia and 12th globally.The Philippines has a significant population of 12 million people, making it one of the largest diasporas globally.Various ethnicities and cultures can be found throughout the islands.Negritos were among the first people to inhabit the archipelago during prehistoric times.A succession of Austronesian peoples followed them.Exchanges were established with Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Islamic nations.Datus, Rajahs, Sultans or Lakans were responsible for the establishment of various countries.Ferdinand Magellan's arrival in Homonhon, Eastern Samar, in 1521 initiated the process of Hispanic colonization.The archipelago was named Las Islas Filipinas by Spanish explorer Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos in 1543, as a tribute to Philip II of Spain.The first Hispanic settlement in the archipelago was established in 1565 when Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi arrived from Mexico City.The Spanish Empire incorporated the Philippines into its dominion for over three centuries.As a result, Roman Catholicism became the most widely practiced religion.Manila was the westernmost point of the trans-Pacific trade that connected Asia to Acapulco in the Americas, using Manila galleons during this period.As the 19th century progressed into the 20th, the Philippine Revolution triggered the brief-lived First Philippine Republic, which was then followed by the violent Philippine-American War of conquest.The United States held onto sovereignty over the islands until the Philippines gained independence after World War II, with the exception of the Japanese occupation.Since then, the Philippines has frequently faced a chaotic history of democracy, with instances of non-violent revolutions overthrowing dictatorships.The country's status as a middle power is due to its large population and significant economic potential.It has been a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEA), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and East Asia Summit.The Asian Development Bank's main office is also located there.An emerging market and newly industrialized country, the Philippines' economy is shifting towards a more service-oriented and manufacturing-based economy.The URL is being accessed through https:

[ http : //www.filmsite.org/fantasyfilms.html Fantasy Films ]   Subgenres   Several sub-categories of fantasy films can be identified , although the delineations between these subgenres , much as in fantasy literature , are somewhat fluid .   The most common fantasy subgenres depicted in movies are High Fantasy and Sword and Sorcery . Both categories typically employ quasi-medieval settings , wizards , magical creatures and other elements commonly associated with fantasy stories .   High Fantasy films tend to feature a more richly developed fantasy world , and may also be more character-oriented or thematically complex . Often , they feature a hero of humble origins and a clear distinction between good and evil set against each other in an epic struggle . Many scholars cite J. R. R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings novel as the prototypical modern example of High Fantasy in literature , and the recent Peter Jackson film adaptation of the books is a good example of the High Fantasy subgenre on the silver screen .   Sword and Sorcery movies tend to be more plot-driven than high fantasy and focus heavily on action sequences , often pitting a physically powerful but unsophisticated warrior against an evil wizard or other supernaturally endowed enemy . Although Sword and Sorcery films sometimes describe an epic battle between good and evil similar to those found in many High Fantasy movies , they may alternately present the hero as having more immediate motivations , such as the need to protect a vulnerable maiden or village , or even being driven by the desire for vengeance .   The 1982 film adaptation of Robert E. Howard 's Conan the Barbarian , for example , is a personal ( non-epic ) story concerning the hero 's quest for revenge and his efforts to thwart a single megalomaniac\u2014while saving a beautiful princess in the process . Some critics refer to such films by the term Sword and Sandal rather than Sword and Sorcery , although others would maintain that the Sword and Sandal label should be reserved only for the subset of fantasy films set in ancient times on the planet Earth , and still others would broaden the term to encompass films that have no fantastic elements whatsoever . To some , the term Sword and Sandal has pejorative connotations , designating a film with a low-quality script , bad acting and poor production values .   Another important subgenre of fantasy films that has become more popular in recent years is contemporary fantasy . Such films feature magical effects or supernatural occurrences happening in the `` real '' world of today .   Films with live action and animation such as Disney 's Mary Poppins , Pete 's Dragon , Enchanted and the Robert Zemeckis film Who Framed Roger Rabbit are also fantasy films although are more often referred to as Live action/animation hybrids ( 2 of those are also classified as musicals ) .   Fantasy films set in the afterlife , called Bangsian Fantasy , are less common , although films such as the 1991 Albert Brooks comedy Defending Your Life would likely qualify . Other uncommon subgenres include Historical Fantasy and Romantic Fantasy , although 2003 's Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl successfully incorporated elements of both .   As noted above , superhero movies and fairy tale films might each be considered subgenres of fantasy films , although most would classify them as altogether separate movie genres .   Fantasy movies and the film industry   As a cinematic genre , fantasy has traditionally not been regarded as highly as the related genre of science fiction film . Undoubtedly , the fact that until recently fantasy films often suffered from the `` Sword and Sandal '' afflictions of inferior production values , over-the-top acting and decidedly poor special effects was a significant factor in fantasy film 's low regard .   Since the late 1990s , however , the genre has gained new respectability in a way , driven principally by the successful adaptations of J.R.R . Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings and J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter series .

Sword and Sorcery are the two most frequently featured fantasy subgenres in movies.Both genres commonly incorporate quasi-medieval settings, wizards, magical creatures, and other fantasy-based elements.A more elaborate fantasy world and a greater emphasis on characters or thematic complexity are common characteristics of High Fantasy films.Frequently, they showcase an unassuming protagonist

High Fantasy in literature, and the recent Peter Jackson film adaptation showcases the popularity of this subgenre on the silver screen.The plot of Sword and Sorcery movies is more focused on capturing the action, much like high fantasy films, with a physical-action yet visually impervious warrior facing off against an evil wizard or other supernatural force.While Sword and Sorcery movies often depict a fierce battle between good and evil, similar to the conflicts in High Fantasy films, they may also portray characters with more immediate motives, such as protecting vulnerable maidens or villages, or seeking revenge.The 1982 film version of Robert E.In Howard's non-epic Conan the Barbarian, the hero battles against a magnanimous megalomaniac to seek revenge and rescue Vivienne, despite having fought off an evil knight.There are critics who prefer to use the term Sword and Sandal instead of Sargent and Sorcery, but they also argue that this label should be limited to fantasy films set in ancient times on Earth, and others would like to expand the category to include movies without any fantastic elements.To certain individuals, Sword and Sandal holds pejorative implications, referring to an otherwise inferior film with poor scripts, unsatisfactory acting, and inadequate production values.Contemporary fantasy is a significant subgenre of fantasy films that has gained increasing popularity in recent times.The movies depict the occurrence of magical effects or supernatural phenomena in the present-day reality.Although live action and animation are often mixed, such as in Disney's Mary Poppins, Pete'S Dragon, Enchanted, and Robert Zemeckis' Who Framed Roger Rabbit, two of these films are also considered to be musicals.Although Defending Your Life from 1991 is an example of a film that could be considered Bangsian Fantasy, fantasy films set in the afterlife are not as common.Historical Fantasy and Romantic Fantasy are among the rare subgenres that have been created, but the 2003 film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of Black Pearl successfully blended elements from both genres.Although they are distinct movie genres, superhero and fairy tale movies can be classified as subgenres of fantasy films, as previously mentioned.Despite its popularity, the film industry has not traditionally considered fantasy as dominant as it does science fiction films.There is no doubt that the low regard for fantasy films was due to the fact that they often struggled with inferior production values, over-the-top acting, and subpar special effects.The

The winning team is the one that scores the most runs , including any extras gained , during their period batting .   At the start of each game , two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play . The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team , known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , towards a set of wooden stumps , in front of which stands one of the batsmen , known as the striker . The striker 's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat , and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs . The other batsman , known as the non-striker , waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler . The bowler 's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman , at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease .   The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball , leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat , and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground . Runs are scored through two main methods : either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary , or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball . If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground , a run-out occurs . Adjudication is performed on-field by two umpires .

The pitch in the center is rectangular and 22 yards long, with a wicket and three wooden stumps placed at each end for safety.The batting team endeavors to score as many runs as possible while competing against their opponents.The term \"innings\" is used to denote every stage of the game.When either ten batsmen are dismissed or a specific number of overs have been played, the innings concludes and the two teams switch sides.The team that scores the most runs, including any extras, during their innings is known as the winning team.The field of play is always occupied by eleven fielders and two batsmen at the beginning of each game.At the start of the game, the ball is delivered by the bowler from the fielding team to a set of wooden stumps, with the batsman being placed in front of it.The striker's task is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps and score runs by striking it well.The non-striker batsman waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler.The bowler's objective is to prevent runs and then discard the batsman, resulting in his departure from the field while another player takes over at the crease.The most common types of dismissal are bowled, which involves the bowler hitting the stumps with their legs and wicket, caught, or batting.The scoring of runs can be achieved through either striking the ball with enough force to cross the boundary or having the batsmen run in opposite directions while the fielders are retrieving the pitch.The wicket can be left out of reach by either batsman, resulting in a run-out as the fielder retrieves the ball quickly.On-field adjudication is carried out by two umpires.The ICC and MCC are responsible for upholding the rules of cricket.The formats available include Twenty20, which involves each team playing a single 20-overs innings, and Test cricket, where teams play two innings each over five days with unlimited overs.In the past, cricketers have traditionally donned white uniforms, but in limited overs matches, they opt for their team or club colours.In addition to their basic equipment, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury from the ball, which is made of cork and compressed leather.The origins of cricket are uncertain, but it was first recorded in south-east England during the 16th century.With the expansion of the British Empire, it became a global phenomenon and there were initial international matches in the mid-19th century.The ICC, the game's governing body, has a total of 100-members, including 10 full members who are Test cricketers.The international standard for women's cricket, played separately and in an organised manner, has been established.The world's second most popular spectator sport is cricket, which is predominantly played in Australasia, Great Britain and Ireland (GBI), the Indian subcontinent, southern Africa, and the West Indies.The origin of the word  cricket '' has been suggested through various sources.Creckett is the name given to the sport that was mentioned for the first time in 1598.The name of the item may have been derived from the Old English words cricc or cryce, which means crutch or staff.Birley's writing is located on the page.Three.The term \"cricket\" in Samuel Johnson's Dictionary was derived from the words \"cryce\", \"Saxon,\" and \"stick.\"In the Old French, the word criquet appears to mean club or stick.", "question": "which international cricket side had its best year ever in 2014 with five test wins?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "The England cricket team had its best year ever in 2014 with five test wins.", "modAnswer": "The Australian cricket team had its best year ever in 2014 with five test wins.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[4, 0.5016406774520874], [0, 0.487848699092865], [21, 0.42985957860946655], [3, 0.42908352613449097], [20, 0.42770087718963623], [22, 0.4239029288291931], [15, 0.41835635900497437], [16, 0.4091416001319885], [1, 0.3805306553840637], [5, 0.3705361485481262], [8, 0.3515559732913971], [14, 0.3353821039199829], [18, 0.33381104469299316], [11, 0.31182217597961426], [12, 0.31061577796936035], [23, 0.3092259168624878], [10, 0.30728381872177124], [6, 0.2983977794647217], [2, 0.28625649213790894], [9, 0.2852250933647156], [19, 0.26966145634651184], [7, 0.26900383830070496], [28, 0.26336967945098877], [13, 0.21822834014892578], [27, 0.14114883542060852], [17, 0.12217503786087036], [29, 0.10140577703714371], [26, 0.08016429841518402], [24, 0.05896790698170662], [25, -0.01401466503739357]]}, {"test case number": 67, "context": "The Czech Republic ( ; ) , also known as Czechia ( ; ) , is a nation state in Central Europe bordered by Germany to the west , Austria to the south , Slovakia to the east and Poland to the northeast .

The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire . After the fall of the Empire in 907 , the centre of power transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the P\u0159emyslid dynasty . In 1004 , the duchy was formally recognized as part of the Holy Roman Empire , becoming the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 and reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century . Besides Bohemia itself , the king of Bohemia ruled the lands of the Bohemian Crown , he had a vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor , and Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century . In the Hussite wars of the 15th century driven by the Bohemian Reformation , the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five crusades proclaimed by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church .   Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 , the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary . The Protestant Bohemian Revolt ( 1618\u201320 ) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years ' War , after which the monarchy consolidated its rule , reimposed Catholicism , and adopted a policy of gradual Germanization . With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 , the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire and the Czech language experienced a revival as a consequence of widespread romantic nationalism . In the 19th century , the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia , which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I .   Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany in World War II , and was liberated in 1945 by the Soviet and the United States armies . The country lost the majority of its German-speaking inhabitants after they were expelled following the war . The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won the 1946 elections . Following the 1948 coup d'\u00e9tat , Czechoslovakia became a one-party communist state under Soviet influence . In 1968 , increasing dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known as the Prague Spring , which ended in a Soviet-led invasion . Czechoslovakia remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution , when the communist regime collapsed and a multiparty parliamentary republic was formed . On 1 January 1993 , Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved , with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia .   The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004 ; it is a member of the United Nations , the OECD , the OSCE , and the Council of Europe . It is a developed country with an advanced , high income economy and high living standards . The UNDP ranks the country 14th in inequality-adjusted human development . The Czech Republic also ranks as the 6th most peaceful country , while achieving strong performance in democratic governance . It has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union .   Etymology   The traditional English name `` Bohemia '' derives from Latin `` Boiohaemum '' , which means `` home of the Boii '' . The current name comes from the endonym \u010cech , spelled `` C\u017eech '' until the orthographic reform in 1842 .  The name comes from the Slavic tribe ( Czechs , ) and , according to legend , their leader \u010cech , who brought them to Bohemia , to settle on \u0158\u00edp Mountain . The etymology of the word \u010cech can be traced back to the Proto-Slavic root * \u010del- , meaning `` member of the people ; kinsman '' , thus making it cognate to the Czech word \u010dlov\u011bk ( a person ) .   The country has been traditionally divided into three lands , namely Bohemia ( \u010cechy ) in the west , Moravia ( Morava ) in the southeast , and Czech Silesia ( Slezsko ;", "modContext": "The Czech Republic ( ;Czechia, which is also referred to as such (;The nation state is situated in Central Europe and is bordered by Germany to the west, Austria tothe south, Slovakia to its east, and Poland to their northeast.The Czech Republic's continental climate is mainly temperate in nature.With 10 members, the republic operates as a unitary parliamentary democracy.With a population of 5 million, Prague is both the capital and largest city, with over 10.000 inhabitants.A population of 2 million people.Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia are the three historical regions that make up the Czech Republic.In the late 9th century, the Great Moravian Empire created what is now known as the Czech state, namely the Duchy of Bohemia.Following the collapse of the Empire in 907, the Pemyslid dynasty's center of power moved from Moravia to Bohemia.In 1004, the duchy was officially recognized as a part of the Holy Roman Empire, which later became known as the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 and reached its maximum size during the 14th century.The king of Bohemia had authority over the territories of the Bohemian Crown, was a voting member in the selection of Rome's Holy Roman Emperor, and Prague was the capital during the 14th to 17th centuries.In the 15th century, the kingdom was embroiled in economic turmoil due to the Bohemian Reformation and the Hussite wars, but it emerged triumphant in five declared crusades led by Roman Catholic Church leaders.The Habsburg Monarchy assimilated the Crown of Bohemia, the Archduchy of Austria, and the Kingdom of Hungary after the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526.Following the Protestant Bohemian Revolt against the Catholic Habsburgs, the monarchy consolidated its rule, reinstated Catholicism, and pursued a gradual Germanization policy, leading to the Thirty Years' War.The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 led to the Austrian Empire taking over the Bohemian Kingdom and the Czech language's revival due to popular romantic nationalism.After the 19th century, the Czech lands became the industrial hub of the monarchy and eventually formed the nucleus of what is now the Republic of Czechoslovakia in 1918, following the collapse of Hungary after World War I.During World War II, Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany and then freed by the Soviet and American forces in 1945.After the war, the majority of the country's German-speaking population was expelled.In the 1946 elections, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia emerged as the winner.The 1948 coup d'\u00e9tat led to Czechoslovakia becoming a one-party communist state controlled by the Soviet Union.A reform movement known as the Prague Spring was initiated in 1968 due to growing discontent with the regime, resulting in a Soviet-led invasion.Until the 1989 Velvet Revolution, Czechoslovakia was under communist rule and a multiparty parliamentary republic was established.Czechoslovakia disintegrated peacefully on 1 January 1993, and its constituent states were granted independence, resulting in the formation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.The Czech Republic's membership in NATO began in 1999, and it joined the European Union in 2004;The United Nations, OECD, OSCE, and Council of Europe all count it as one of its members.The country is characterized by advanced economic growth, high income levels, and excellent living standards.According to the UNDP, the country is ranked 14th for human development after inequality.The Czech Republic's democratic governance is impressive, and it ranks 6th in terms of peacefulness among countries.The European Union's lowest unemployment rate is found in it.Origin: The traditional English name  Bohemia' comes from the Latin word ostensibly meaning \"Boiohaemum\", which means \"house of the Boii\".The current name is derived from the word ech, which was spelled as 'C' before the orthographic change in 1842.The name is derived from the Slavic tribe, led by their leader ech, who was said to have brought them to Bohemia to settle on a hilly location on P\u00e9p Mountain.The word ech has its roots in the Proto-Slavic root * el-, which means a \"member of the

"Giovanni Antonio Canal ( 28 October 1697 \u2013 19 April 1768 ) , better known as Canaletto , was an Italian painter of landscapes , or vedute , of Venice . He was also an important printmaker in etching . He was the son of the painter Bernardo Canal , he visited England between 1746\u201356 and he is famous for his urban landscapes of Venice . He is very famous for his scenes , usually associated with `` evocative views of the city '' . The Stonemason\u00b4s Yard , was his finest work around 1725 and was presented by Sir George Beaumont in 1823/8 .   Canaletto , together with Giambattista Pittoni , Giovan Battista Tiepolo , Giovan Battista Piazzetta , Giuseppe Maria Crespi and Francesco Guardi forms the ultimate group of Venetian old master painters .   Early career   He was born in Venice as the son of the painter Bernardo Canal , hence his mononym Canaletto ( `` little Canal '' ) , and Artemisia Barbieri . Canaletto served his apprenticeship with his father and his brother . He began in his father 's occupation , that of a theatrical scene painter . Canaletto was inspired by the Roman vedutista Giovanni Paolo Pannini , and started painting the daily life of the city and its people .   After returning from Rome in 1719 , he began painting in his topographical style . His first known signed and dated work is Architectural Capriccio ( 1723 , Milan , in a private collection ) . Studying with the older Luca Carlevarijs , a moderately-talented painter of urban cityscapes , he rapidly became his master 's equal .   In 1725 , the painter Alessandro Marchesini , who was also the buyer for the Lucchese art collector Stefano Conti , had inquired about buying two more 'views of Venice ' , when the agent urged him to consider instead the work of `` Antonio Canale ... it is like Carlevaris , but you can see the sun shining in it . ''   Outdoor painting   Much of Canaletto 's early artwork was painted `` from nature '' , differing from the then customary practice of completing paintings in the studio . Some of his later works do revert to this custom , as suggested by the tendency for distant figures to be painted as blobs of colour \u2013 an effect produced by using a camera obscura , which blurs farther-away objects .   However , his paintings are always notable for their accuracy : he recorded the seasonal submerging of Venice in water and ice .   Early and late work   Canaletto 's early works remain his most coveted and , according to many authorities , his best . One of his early pieces is The Stonemason 's Yard ( 1729 , London , the National Gallery ) which depicts a humble working area of the city .   Later Canaletto painted grand scenes of the canals of Venice and the Doge 's Palace . His large-scale landscapes portrayed the city 's pageantry and waning traditions , making innovative use of atmospheric effects and strong local colors . For these qualities , his works may be said to have anticipated Impressionism .   His graphic print S.A Giustina in Pr\u00e0 della Vale was found in the 2012 Nazi loot discovery .   Work in England   Many of his pictures were sold to Englishmen on their Grand Tour , often through the agency of the merchant Joseph Smith ( who was later appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744 ) .   It was Smith who acted as an agent for Canaletto , first in requesting paintings of Venice from the painter in the early 1720s and helping him to sell his paintings to other Englishmen .   In the 1740s Canaletto 's market was disrupted when the War of the Austrian Succession led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice . Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of `` capricci '' ( or architectural phantasies ) ( capriccio Italian for fancy ) in his vedute ideale , but the returns were not high enough , and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London , to be closer to his market .   He remained in England until 1755 , producing views of London ( including several of the new Westminster Bridge , which was completed during his stay ) and of his patrons ' castles and houses . His 1754 painting of Old Walton Bridge includes an image of Canaletto himself .

In its approximately 12 centuries of existence , Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to a classical republic and then to an increasingly autocratic empire . Through conquest and assimilation , it came to dominate Southern and Western Europe , Asia Minor , North Africa , and parts of Northern and Eastern Europe . Rome was preponderant throughout the Mediterranean region and was one of the most powerful entities of the ancient world . It is often grouped into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece , and their similar cultures and societies are known as the Greco-Roman world .   Ancient Roman society has contributed to modern government , law , politics , engineering , art , literature , architecture , technology , warfare , religion , language and society . A highly developed civilization , Rome professionalized and expanded its military and created a system of government called res publica , the inspiration for modern republics such as the United States and France . It achieved impressive technological and architectural feats , such as the construction of an extensive system of aqueducts and roads , as well as the construction of large monuments , palaces , and public facilities .   By the end of the Republic ( 27 BC ) , Rome had conquered the lands around the Mediterranean and beyond : its domain extended from the Atlantic to Arabia and from the mouth of the Rhine to North Africa . The Roman Empire emerged with the end of the Republic and the dictatorship of Augustus Caesar . 721 years of Roman-Persian Wars started in 92 BC with their first war against Parthia . It would become the longest conflict in human history , and have major lasting effects and consequences for both empires . Under Trajan , the Empire reached its territorial peak . Republican mores and traditions started to decline during the imperial period , with civil wars becoming a prelude common to the rise of a new emperor . Splinter states , such as the Palmyrene Empire , would temporarily divide the Empire during the crisis of the 3rd century .   Plagued by internal instability and attacked by various migrating peoples , the western part of the empire broke up into independent kingdoms in the 5th century . This splintering is a landmark historians use to divide the ancient period of universal history from the pre-medieval `` Dark Ages '' of Europe .   Founding myth   According to the founding myth of Rome , the city was founded on 21 April 753 BC by twin brothers Romulus and Remus , who descended from the Trojan prince Aeneas and who were grandsons of the Latin King , Numitor of Alba Longa . King Numitor was deposed from his throne by his brother , Amulius , while Numitor 's daughter , Rhea Silvia , gave birth to the twins . Because Rhea Silvia was raped and impregnated by Mars , the Roman god of war , the twins were considered half-divine .   The new king , Amulius , feared Romulus and Remus would take back the throne , so he ordered them to be drowned . A she-wolf ( or a shepherd 's wife in some accounts ) saved and raised them , and when they were old enough , they returned the throne of Alba Longa to Numitor .   The twins then founded their own city , but Romulus killed Remus in a quarrel over the location of the Roman Kingdom , though some sources state the quarrel was about who was going to rule or give his name to the city . Romulus became the source of the city 's name . In order to attract people to the city , Rome became a sanctuary for the indigent , exiled , and unwanted . This caused a problem for Rome , which had a large workforce but was bereft of women .

there were also massive palaces (including those under the Alexander-Pompey complex), and public facilities.From the Atlantic to Arabia and from the Rhine to North Africa, Rome had taken control of all the territories around Europe by the end of the Republic ( 27 BC).With the demise of the Republic and Augustus Caesar's dictatorship, the Roman Empire was born.In 92 BC, the Roman-Persian Wars began with the first battle against Parthia, which took place 721 years ago.The conflict that took place was the lengthiest in human history and had a significant impact on both empires.The Empire reached its highest point of territorial expansion under Trajan.The decline of Republican customs and beliefs began during the imperial era, with civil wars becoming a common trigger for the rise of emperors.Splinter states, including the Palmyrene Empire, caused a temporary division of the Empire during the 3rd century's crisis.In the 5th century, the western part of the empire disintegrated into separate kingdoms due to internal instability and attacks by migrating peoples.This fragmentation is a crucial element used by historians to differentiate between the ancient period of universal history and the pre-medieval Dark Ages of Europe.The founding myth of Rome posits that on 21 April 753 BC, the city was founded by twin brothers Romulus and Remus, who were descended from Aeneas and were grandsons of Numitor of Alba Longa.Amulius, the brother of King Numitor, removed him from power, and his daughter Rhea Silvia gave birth to twins.The twins were considered half-divine due to Rhea Silvia's rape and impregnation by Mars, the god of war in Roman mythology.The fear of Romulus and Remus regaining the throne led Amulius to order their drowning.A she-wolf, or a shepherd's wife, saved and raised them, and they returned the throne of Alba Longa to Numitor when they were old enough.After founding their own city, the twins were killed by Romulus in a dispute over the location of the Roman Kingdom, although some sources suggest that the conflict was about who would take control of or give his name to the city.The name of the city was derived from Romulus.To draw people to the city, Rome became a sanctuary for the destitute, exiled, and unwanted.Rome's lack of women caused a problem, despite the high number of workers employed.Despite his efforts to secure marriage rights with the towns and tribes around him, Romulus was met with a deluge of undesirables who turned on him in Rome.", "question": "what type of bridge was used to bring water to roman cities?", "groundTruth": "aqueduct", "answer": "Aqueducts.", "modAnswer": "Aqueducts.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[11, 0.41284990310668945], [9, 0.40497592091560364], [12, 0.3804900050163269], [28, 0.37353605031967163], [7, 0.35169827938079834], [1, 0.3454670310020447], [0, 0.33748042583465576], [5, 0.33656391501426697], [8, 0.32215309143066406], [29, 0.2950248718261719], [10, 0.2889787554740906], [26, 0.28274238109588623], [21, 0.26489678025245667], [13, 0.24947717785835266], [15, 0.23842260241508484], [16, 0.23160013556480408], [25, 0.21702994406223297], [27, 0.21587787568569183], [30, 0.21536505222320557], [17, 0.19969871640205383], [24, 0.19077670574188232], [18, 0.1843997836112976], [20, 0.15015658736228943], [6, 0.14342495799064636], [19, 0.14240887761116028], [14, 0.1417756825685501], [4, 0.1357305645942688], [2, 0.10488826036453247], [3, 0.08280842751264572], [23, 0.07809282094240189], [22, -0.01761726289987564]]}, {"test case number": 71, "context": "The Gulf War ( 2 August 1990 \u2013 28 February 1991 ) , codenamed Operation Desert Shield ( 2 August 1990 \u2013 17 January 1991 ) , for operations leading to the buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm ( 17 January 1991 \u2013 28 February 1991 ) in its combat phase , was a war waged by coalition forces from 34 nations led by the United States against Iraq in response to Iraq 's invasion and annexation of Kuwait .

A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms ( e.g . a noble gas like neon ) , elemental molecules made from one type of atom ( e.g . oxygen ) , or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms ( e.g . carbon dioxide ) . A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air . What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles . This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer . The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image . One type of commonly known gas is steam .   The gaseous state of matter is found between the liquid and plasma states , the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases . Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention . High-density atomic gases super cooled to incredibly low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either a Bose gas or a Fermi gas . For a comprehensive listing of these exotic states of matter see list of states of matter .   Elemental gases   The only chemical elements which are stable multi atom homonuclear molecules at standard temperature and pressure ( STP ) , are hydrogen ( H2 ) , nitrogen ( N2 ) and oxygen ( O2 ) ;  plus two halogens , fluorine ( F2 ) and chlorine ( Cl2 ) .  These gases , when grouped together with the monatomic noble gases ; which are helium ( He ) , neon ( Ne ) , argon ( Ar ) , krypton ( Kr ) , xenon ( Xe ) and radon ( Rn ) ; are called `` elemental gases '' . Alternatively they are sometimes known as `` molecular gases '' to distinguish them from molecules that are also chemical compounds .   Etymology   The word gas is a neologism first used by the early 17th-century Flemish chemist J.B. van Helmont . Van Helmont 's word appears to have been simply a phonetic transcription of the Greek word \u03c7\u03ac\u03bf\u03c2 Chaos \u2013 the g in Dutch being pronounced like ch in `` loch '' \u2013 in which case Van Helmont was simply following the established alchemical usage first attested in the works of Paracelsus . According to Paracelsus 's terminology , chaos meant something like `` ultra-rarefied water '' .   An alternative story is that Van Helmont 's word is corrupted from gahst ( or geist ) , signifying a ghost or spirit . This was because certain gases suggested a supernatural origin , such as from their ability to cause death , extinguish flames , and to occur in `` mines , bottom of wells , churchyards and other lonely places '' .   Physical characteristics   Because most gases are difficult to observe directly , they are described through the use of four physical properties or macroscopic characteristics : pressure , volume , number of particles ( chemists group them by moles ) and temperature . These four characteristics were repeatedly observed by scientists such as Robert Boyle , Jacques Charles , John Dalton , Joseph Gay-Lussac and Amedeo Avogadro for a variety of gases in various settings . Their detailed studies ultimately led to a mathematical relationship among these properties expressed by the ideal gas law ( see simplified models section below ) .   Gas particles are widely separated from one another , and consequently have weaker intermolecular bonds than liquids or solids . These intermolecular forces result from electrostatic interactions between gas particles . Like-charged areas of different gas particles repel , while oppositely charged regions of different gas particles attract one another ; gases that contain permanently charged ions are known as plasmas . Gaseous compounds with polar covalent bonds contain permanent charge imbalances and so experience relatively strong intermolecular forces , although the molecule while the compound 's net charge remains neutral . Transient , randomly induced charges exist across non-polar covalent bonds of molecules and electrostatic interactions caused by them are referred to as Van der Waals forces . The interaction of these intermolecular forces varies within a substance which determines many of the physical properties unique to each gas . A comparison of boiling points for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds leads us to this conclusion .

He therefore followed the alchemical usage that was first documented in Paracelsus.Paracelsus equated chaos with the presence of ultra-rarefied water.A different tale suggests that Van Helmont's word is corrupted from the word \"gahst,\" implying the presence of a ghost or spirit.Some of the gases were believed to have supernatural origins, such as their ability to cause death, extinguish flames and occur in isolated locations like mines or minefields.Due to their inability to be directly observed, most gases are described using physical properties or macroscopic characteristics such as pressure, volume, number of particles (chemists classify them by moles), and temperature.The four characteristics of different gases were observed by scientists like Robert Boyle, Jacques Charles, John Dalton, Joseph Gay-Lussac, and Amedeo Avogadro in various settings.The ideal gas law was used to express the mathematical relationship between these properties, which were ultimately determined through detailed studies.Gas particles are more distant from each other than liquids or solids, resulting in weaker intermolecular bonds.Intermolecular forces arise from the electrostatic interactions between gas particles.Comparable charges in gases have opposite charges that repel each other, while similar charges are mutually beneficial;Gases that possess a constant charge are classified as plasmas.Gaseous compounds with polar covalent bonds exhibit permanent charge imbalances and experience strong intermolecular forces, even though their net charge remains neutral.Van der Waals forces are responsible for the electrostatic interactions that occur when non-polar covalent bonds between molecules are induced by random, transient charges.The intermolecular forces within a substance cause variations in their physical properties, which are particular to specific gases.This conclusion is based on the comparison of boiling points for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds.", "question": "what is the most common gas in the earth's atmosphere?", "groundTruth": "nitrogen", "answer": "The most common gas in Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen (N2).", "modAnswer": "The most common gas in Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen (N2).", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[8, 0.6930217742919922], [12, 0.5967701077461243], [19, 0.5846819281578064], [1, 0.5831938982009888], [0, 0.5572617053985596], [21, 0.5496225357055664], [9, 0.5364949107170105], [35, 0.522463321685791], [13, 0.5126222372055054], [7, 0.5019394755363464], [17, 0.4990188479423523], [31, 0.46077069640159607], [20, 0.4526238441467285], [15, 0.43259063363075256], [36, 0.4319649040699005], [3, 0.43072035908699036], [5, 0.42900216579437256], [23, 0.42526090145111084], [22, 0.4200385808944702], [30, 0.418537437915802], [33, 0.4030389189720154], [16, 0.3900440037250519], [29, 0.37427273392677307], [39, 0.35585182905197144], [32, 0.3300750255584717], [11, 0.32412320375442505], [34, 0.3176485300064087], [10, 0.3076813220977783], [14, 0.2817962169647217], [18, 0.22303618490695953], [37, 0.2196299433708191], [40, 0.200714111328125], [27, 0.1828949749469757], [38, 0.137926384806633], [2, 0.13621464371681213], [4, 0.13621464371681213], [6, 0.13621464371681213], [26, 0.12674552202224731], [24, 0.08612386137247086], [25, 0.05250732973217964], [28, -0.023136895149946213]]}, {"test case number": 74, "context": "Gremlins is a 1984 American comedy horror film directed by Joe Dante and released by Warner Bros .

The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase `` God , King and Country '' . Tories generally advocate monarchism , are usually of a high church Anglican religious heritage , and are opposed to the liberalism of the Whig faction . Under the Corn Laws ( 1815\u20131846 ) a majority of Tories supported protectionist agrarianism with tariffs being imposed at the time for sustainability , self-sufficiency and enhanced wages in rural employment .   The Tory political faction originally emerged within the Parliament of England to uphold the legitimist rights of James II , Duke of York , to succeed his brother Charles II to the throne . James was a Catholic while the state institutions had broken from the Catholic Church\u2014this was an issue for the Exclusion Crisis supporting Patricians , the political heirs to the nonconformist Roundheads and Covenanters . There were two Tory ministries under James II ; the first led by Laurence Hyde , 1st Earl of Rochester , the second by Lord Belasyse . A significant faction took part in the ousting of James II with the Whigs to defend the Anglican Church or definitive protestantism . A large but dwindling faction of Tories held sympathy for Catholic Stuart heirs to the throne from the 1714 accession of George I of Great Britain , the first Hanoverian monarch , many of which supported Jacobitism , the military campaigns of which saw them lost and castigated . Although only a minority of Tories gave their adhesion to the Jacobite risings , it was used by the Whigs to completely discredit the Tories and paint them as traitors . After the advent of the Prime Ministerial system under the Whig Robert Walpole , John Stuart , 3rd Earl of Bute 's premiership in the reign of George III marked a revival .   Conservatism emerged by the end of the 18th century\u2014it synthesised moderate Whig economic positions and many Tory social values to create a new political philosophy and faction , in opposition to the French Revolution . Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger led the way in this . Interventionism and a strong military were to prove a hallmark of Toryism under subsequent Prime Ministers . Due to these Tories leading the formation of the Conservative Party , members of the party are colloquially referred to as Tories , even if they are not traditionalists . Actual adherents to traditional Toryism in contemporary times may be referred to as `` High Tories '' as the traditionalist conservative values of Toryism differ from that of the more liberal and cosmopolitan parts of the Conservative Party .   History of the term   The word `` Tory '' derives from the Middle Irish word t\u00f3raidhe ; modern Irish t\u00f3ra\u00ed : outlaw , robber or brigand , from the Irish word t\u00f3ir , meaning `` pursuit '' , since outlaws were `` pursued men '' . It was originally used to refer to a Rapparee and later applied to Confederates or Cavaliers in arms . The term was thus originally a term of abuse , `` an Irish rebel '' , before being adopted as a political label in the same way as `` Whig '' .   Towards the end of Charles II 's reign ( 1660\u201385 ) there was some debate about whether or not his brother , James , Duke of York , should be allowed to succeed to the throne . `` Whigs '' , originally a reference to Scottish cattle-drivers ( stereotypically radical anti-Catholic Covenanters ) , was the abusive term directed at those who wanted to exclude James on the grounds that he was a Roman Catholic . Those who were not prepared to exclude James were labelled `` Abhorrers '' and later `` Tories '' . Titus Oates applied the term `` Tory '' , which then signified an Irish robber , to those who would not believe in his Popish Plot , and the name gradually became extended to all who were supposed to have sympathy with the Catholic Duke of York .   The suffix -ism was quickly added to both `` Whig '' and ``", "modContext": "Toryism, a political philosophy, is rooted in traditionalism and conservatism from the British perspective.The English Civil War saw the Tory political faction come into being through the Cavalier faction.The politics of the United Kingdom and certain regions of Canada's Commonwealth of Nations are shaped by this political philosophy.The former British Empire had its own proponents, including the Loyalists of British America who opposed American secession during the American Revolutionary War.The Tory ideology has been encapsulated by the phrase \"God, King and Country.\"The Tories typically support monarchism, have a religious background in the Anglican movement, and are against the Whigs' liberalism.During the Corn Laws ( 1815-1846), most Tories advocated for protectionist agriculture, which involved the imposition of tariffs to promote sustainability, independence, and higher wages in rural areas.The Tory political group was initially established in the Parliament of England to secure the legitimist rights of James II, Duke of York, as a successor to his brother Charles II.The Exclusion Crisis, which was fueled by the Patricians, were involved in dealing with the issue of James being Catholic while the state institutions had broken away from the Catholic Church. These groups were the political successors to the nonconformist Roundheads and Covenanters.James II had two ministries that were affiliated with the Tory party.Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester, was in charge of the first order, and Lord Belasyse was responsible for the second.The Whigs were involved in the removal of James II to safeguard the Anglican Church or definitive protestantism, which was a significant cause.The Tories had a growing amount of support for the Catholic Stuart heirs to the throne after George I of Great Britain took power in 1714, but their numbers have been decreasing. Many of them were supporters of Jacobitism, which led to their loss and criticism in military operations.Although a small number of Tories were willing to support the Jacobite uprisings, they were exploited by the Whigs to discredit them and label them as traitors.A revival occurred after the introduction of the Prime Ministerial system by Whig Robert Walpole, John Stuart, and the 3rd Earl of Bute during George III's reign.By the late 1700s, Conservatism had emerged as a political philosophy and faction that combined moderate Whig economic views and various Tory social values to oppose the French Revolution.This was led by Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger.The hallmark of Toryism was the use of a powerful military and interventionist policies under subsequent Prime Ministers.Members of the Conservative Party, who may not be traditionalists, are commonly referred to as Tories due to their leadership in creating the party.Traditional Conservatives in today's society are often referred to as the \"High Tories,\" due to their unique blend of traditional conservative values that distinguish them from the more liberal and cosmopolitan parts of the Conservative Party.The term  Tory's origin can be traced back to the Middle Irish word t\u00f3raidhe;In Irish language, the term t\u00f3ra is used to describe an outlaw, criminal, or brigand, which comes from the word terry, meaning \"purchasing,\" because pursued men were considered as targets.The term's first usage was to designate a Rapparee, but it was later used to describe soldiers who were Confederates or Cavaliers.Initially used as a derogatory term for an Irish rebel, the term was later adopted as political terminology, similar to \"Whig.\"There was a dispute over whether James, Duke of York, should have been allowed to become the monarch towards the end of Charles II's reign.Initially, the term \"Wigs\" was used to describe Scottish cattle-drivers who were stereotypical anti-Catholic Covenanters and were targeted for excluding James due to his Roman Catholic faith.Those who refused to exclude James were labeled as  Abhorrers'' and later referred to as the repressed Tories.The term \"Tory\" was employed by Titus Oates to refer to an Irish robber, and it gradually broadened to encompass those who did not accept his Popish Plot but still sympathize with the Catholic Duke of York.", "question": "who was the first tory prime minister of great britain (may, 1762 to july, 1765)?", "groundTruth": "3rd earl of bute", "answer": "The first Tory Prime Minister of Great Britain, from May 1762 to July 1765, was John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute.", "modAnswer": "The first Tory Prime Minister of Great Britain, serving from May 1762 to July 1765, was John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[9, 0.5574520826339722], [0, 0.4696686863899231], [17, 0.44830745458602905], [20, 0.43757471442222595], [7, 0.4112514853477478], [14, 0.40649616718292236], [27, 0.4031940996646881], [12, 0.37223300337791443], [10, 0.35844433307647705], [4, 0.3583384156227112], [18, 0.35794174671173096], [1, 0.3356480002403259], [19, 0.32533931732177734], [15, 0.3076191544532776], [2, 0.29811471700668335], [5, 0.2796629071235657], [26, 0.27778124809265137], [13, 0.2736313045024872], [24, 0.2583101689815521], [6, 0.22112590074539185], [11, 0.19332045316696167], [25, 0.18761637806892395], [23, 0.16649720072746277], [3, 0.15019448101520538], [16, 0.13678359985351562], [22, 0.07573176175355911], [8, 0.06206528842449188], [21, 0.051750198006629944]]}, {"test case number": 77, "context": "Food coloring , or color additive , is any dye , pigment or substance that imparts color when it is added to food or drink .

Regulation   Past use and regulation history   The addition of colorants to foods is thought to have occurred in Egyptian cities as early as 1500 BC , when candy makers added natural extracts and wine to improve the products ' appearance . During the Middle Ages , the economy in the European countries was based on agriculture , and the peasants were accustomed to producing their own food locally or trading within the village communities . Under feudalism , aesthetic aspects were not considered , at least not by the vast majority of the generally very poor population . This situation changed with urbanization at the beginning of the Modern Age , when trade emerged\u2014especially the import of precious spices and colors . One of the very first food laws , created in Augsburg , Germany , in 1531 , concerned spices or colorants and required saffron counterfeiters to be burned .   With the onset of the industrial revolution , people became dependent on foods produced by others . These new urban dwellers demanded food at low cost . Analytical chemistry was still primitive and regulations few . The adulteration of foods flourished . Heavy metal and other inorganic element-containing compounds turned out to be cheap and suitable to `` restore '' the color of watered-down milk and other foodstuffs , some more lurid examples being :  * Red lead ( Pb3O4 ) and vermillion ( HgS ) were routinely used to color cheese and confectionery .  * Copper arsenite ( CuHAsO3 ) was used to recolor used tea leaves for resale . It also caused two deaths when used to color a dessert in 1860 .   Sellers at the time offered more than 80 artificial coloring agents , some invented for dyeing textiles , not foods . Many color additives had never been tested for toxicity or other adverse effects . Historical records show that injuries , even deaths , resulted from tainted colorants . In 1851 , about 200 people were poisoned in England , 17 of them fatally , directly as a result of eating adulterated lozenges . In 1856 , mauveine , the first synthetic color , was developed by Sir William Henry Perkin and by the turn of the century , unmonitored color additives had spread through Europe and the United States in all sorts of popular foods , including ketchup , mustard , jellies , and wine .

BBC Four launched on 2 March 2002 , with a schedule running from 19:00 to 04:00 . The channel shows `` a wide variety of programmes including comedy , documentaries , music , international film , original programmes , drama and current affairs ... an alternative to programmes on the mainstream TV channels '' . It is required by its licence to broadcast at least 100 hours of new arts and music programmes , 110 hours of new factual programmes and to premiere twenty international films each year .   History   BBC Four launched on 2 March 2002 at 19.00 GMT , having been delayed from the original planned 2001 launch . BBC 4 began originally as a late schedule to BBC 2 , before it received its own channel , along with BBC 3 . Weirdly , BBC 4 had to launch before BBC Three as a result of the government delaying approval plans . The channel replaced BBC Knowledge , an educational and cultural channel which had undergone many changes throughout its lifetime ; in its final format it carried a schedule of documentaries and art programming , essentially a test of the new BBC Four schedule . BBC Four would rebrand this channel , and bring it into line with the well recognised BBC One and Two brands at the same time . Planning for the new channel , along with the new BBC Three , had been in progress since October 2000 ; however , the incumbent government delayed approving the new BBC digital plans . The BBC Four plans were approved earlier , and as a result launched before BBC Three .   BBC Four was different from the old BBC Knowledge : the channel would be more heavily promoted with more new and original programming and the channel would not be broadcast 24 hours a day . This was because on the Freeview digital terrestrial platform , BBC Four is broadcast in a statistically multiplexed stream in Multiplex B that timeshares with the CBeebies channel ( which is on air from 6.00 until 19.00 ) . As a result , BBC Four broadcasts from 19.00 to around 4.00 each night , with an hour 's down-time and promotions for CBeebies before the start of that channel 's schedule .   On 12 May 2011 , BBC Four was added to the Sky EPG in Ireland on channel 230 .   Organisation   BBC Four forms part of the BBC Vision group , and as a result , the channel controller is answerable to the head of this executive department : Emma Swain , as of 2012 . The channel direction is determined by the channel 's remit , set by royal charter and the corporation 's governing body ( the BBC Trust ) , and by the channel controller . In October 2013 , following the departure of Richard Klein from the controllership , the management of the channel changed , with the role of Controller of BBC Four scrapped : from this point the Controller of BBC Two would have ultimate oversight of BBC Four as part of their role , absorbing some of the former duties of the Controller of BBC Four , but a new 'Channel Editor ' post , reporting up to this controller , would be created to take day-to-day charge of Four . The controllers of BBC Four from 2002-2016 had been :   * 2002\u20132004 : Roly Keating  * 2004\u20132008 : Janice Hadlow  * 2008\u20132013 : Richard Klein  * 2013\u20132014 : Janice Hadlow ( as Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four ) `` on an interim basis '' - Hadlow had been Controller of BBC Two since departing BBC Four in 2008  * Early 2014 : Adam Barker ( interim Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four following Janice Hadlow 's departure to a new post )  * 2014\u20132016 : Kim Shillinglaw ( as Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four )   Channel Editors of BBC Four have been :   * 2013\u2013present : Cassian Harrison   BBC Four has an annual budget of \u00a354.3 million .

In 2004 , it came 9th in Britain 's Best Sitcom . In the United States , it aired on various PBS stations under the title Good Neighbors .   Background   The Good Life was written by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey for Richard Briers , the only cast member with a previously established high-profile . Larbey and Esmonde were inspired by Larbey attaining his 40th birthday , which seemed to them a milestone in most people 's lives . Their storyline has the Goods ' decision to pursue self-sufficiency conflicting sharply with the habits of the Leadbetters , who live next door . The conflict between neighbours balanced with an increasingly close friendship creates comic tension as that friendship is tried to its limits .   Peter Bowles was originally cast to play the role of Jerry , but was unavailable . He later starred opposite Penelope Keith in To the Manor Born . Hannah Gordon was considered for the role of Barbara but ruled out , having recently played a similar role in the BBC sitcom My Wife Next Door .

The study of these traditional reptile groups , historically combined with that of modern amphibians , is called herpetology .   The earliest known proto-reptiles originated around 312 million years ago during the Carboniferous period , having evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods that became increasingly adapted to life on dry land . Some early examples include the lizard-like Hylonomus and Casineria . In addition to the living reptiles , there are many diverse groups that are now extinct , in some cases due to mass extinction events . In particular , the K\u2013Pg extinction wiped out the pterosaurs , plesiosaurs , ornithischians , and sauropods , as well as many species of theropods ( e.g . tyrannosaurids and dromaeosaurids ) , crocodyliforms , and squamates ( e.g . mosasaurids ) .   Modern non-avian reptiles inhabit every continent with the exception of Antarctica ( If birds are classed as reptiles , then all continents are inhabited . ) Several living subgroups are recognized : Testudines ( turtles , terrapins and tortoises ) , approximately 400 species ; Sphenodontia ( tuatara from New Zealand ) , 1 species ; Squamata ( lizards , snakes , and worm lizards ) , over 9,600 species ; Crocodilia ( crocodiles , gavials , caimans , and alligators ) , 25 species ; and Aves ( birds ) , 10,000 species . Because some reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles ( crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards ) , many modern scientists prefer to make Reptilia a monophyletic grouping and so also include the birds , which today contain over 10,000 species .   Reptiles are tetrapod vertebrates , creatures that either have four limbs or , like snakes , are descended from four-limbed ancestors . Unlike amphibians , reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage . Most reptiles are oviparous , although several species of squamates are viviparous , as were some extinct aquatic clades \u2014 the fetus develops within the mother , contained in a placenta rather than an eggshell . As amniotes , reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport , which adapt them to reproduction on dry land . Many of the viviparous species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to those of mammals , with some providing initial care for their hatchlings . Extant reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko , Sphaerodactylus ariasae , which can grow up to 17 mm to the saltwater crocodile , Crocodylus porosus , which may reach 6 m in length and weigh over 1000 kg .   Classification   Research history   In the 18th century , the reptiles were , from the outset of classification , grouped with the amphibians . Linnaeus , working from species-poor Sweden , where the common adder and grass snake are often found hunting in water , included all reptiles and amphibians in class `` III \u2013 Amphibia '' in his Systema Natur\u00e6 .  The terms `` reptile '' and `` amphibian '' were largely interchangeable , `` reptile '' ( from Latin repere , `` to creep '' ) being preferred by the French . Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti was the first to formally use the term `` Reptilia '' for an expanded selection of reptiles and amphibians basically similar to that of Linnaeus . Today , the two groups are still commonly treated under the same heading as herptiles .   It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that it became clear that reptiles and amphibians are , in fact , quite different animals , and Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille erected the class Batracia ( 1825 ) for the latter , dividing the tetrapods into the four familiar classes of reptiles , amphibians , birds , and mammals . The British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley made Latreille 's definition popular and , together with Richard Owen , expanded Reptilia to include the various fossil `` antediluvian monsters '' , including dinosaurs and the mammal-like ( synapsid ) Dicynodon he helped describe . This was not the only possible classification scheme : In the Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1863 , Huxley grouped the vertebrates into mammals , sauroids , and ichthyoids ( the latter containing the fishes and amphibians ) . He subsequently proposed the names of Sauropsida and Ichthyopsida for the latter two groups .

There are currently over 10,000 species.Tetrapod vertebrates, which are either four-limbed or descended from four limbed ancestors like snakes, make up reptiles.In contrast to amphibians, reptiles do not possess an aquatic larva.While the majority of reptiles are oviparous, some species of squamates and certain extinct aquatic groups have viviparity. The baby develops inside the mother, rather than inside an eggshell.Amniotes utilize membranes to shield and transport their eggs, which enable them to reproduce on land without water exposure.Several viviparous species provide their fetuses with nourishment from placenta of different types, similar to those found in mammals, while others take care of their young first.The size of reptiles varies greatly, from the tiny Sphaerodactylus ariasae geckoe which can reach 17 mm to the large and powerful Crocodylus porosus, an extremely large saltwater crocodile that weighs over 1000 kg.The research conducted during the 18th century focused on classification, and from then on, reptiles were classified alongside amphibians.In Sweden, where the common adder and grass snake are frequently used as bait, Linnaeus included all reptiles and amphibians in class  III \u2013 Amphibia in his Systema Natur.The French preferred the term reptile (from the Latin word repere, which means creep in a native way) over amphibian, as both terms were widely used.The term Reptilia was first used by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti to refer to an expanded group of reptiles and amphibians, which were almost identical to those of Linnaeus.Herptiles and the two groups are still commonly grouped together today.The distinction between reptiles and amphibians was not acknowledged until the early 1800s, when Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille constructed the Batracia class to differentiate them.Latreille's definition gained popularity among British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley, who subsequently expanded Reptilia by including various fossilized monsters like dinosaurs and synapsids.Huxley classified vertebrates into mammals, sauroids, and ichthyoids in his 1863 lectures at the Royal College of Surgeons.Subsequently, he suggested the names Sauropsida and Ichthyopsidas for the latter two groups.", "question": "what reptile, of which there are two living species, the american and the chinese, got its name from the spanish for lizard?", "groundTruth": "alligators", "answer": "The reptile you're referring to is the tuatara.", "modAnswer": "The reptile you're referring to is the \"Gila monster.\"", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[1, 0.6201938986778259], [25, 0.558985710144043], [3, 0.524159848690033], [26, 0.5213614702224731], [0, 0.5187820196151733], [23, 0.5073749423027039], [13, 0.4970836043357849], [11, 0.48356330394744873], [2, 0.4796708822250366], [28, 0.46045684814453125], [14, 0.4558294713497162], [17, 0.4557071030139923], [7, 0.4282774329185486], [22, 0.4262683093547821], [16, 0.4011792540550232], [18, 0.3998996615409851], [12, 0.3909626603126526], [4, 0.3683609962463379], [10, 0.3596861958503723], [24, 0.34607118368148804], [15, 0.3342247009277344], [30, 0.3202824592590332], [19, 0.31263232231140137], [5, 0.31120216846466064], [29, 0.2991775870323181], [20, 0.2578643560409546], [9, 0.23315970599651337], [31, 0.21517068147659302], [6, 0.207727313041687], [8, 0.207727313041687], [21, 0.1186729297041893], [27, 0.11059416830539703]]}, {"test case number": 84, "context": "The modern Olympic Games or Olympics ( ) are the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions .

"An ecchymosis is a subcutaneous spot of bleeding ( from extravasation of blood ) with diameter larger than 1 cm . It is similar to ( and sometimes indistinguishable from ) a hematoma , commonly called a bruise , though the terms are not interchangeable in careful usage . Specifically , bruises are caused by trauma whereas ecchymoses , which are the same as the spots of purpura except larger , are not necessarily caused by trauma , often being caused by pathophysiologic cell function .   A broader definition of ecchymosis is the escape of blood into the tissues from ruptured blood vessels . The term also applies to the subcutaneous discoloration resulting from seepage of blood within the contused tissue .   Signs and symptoms   Hematomas can be subdivided by size . By definition , ecchymoses are 1 centimeter in size or larger , and are therefore larger than petechiae ( less than 2 millimeters in diameter ) or purpura ( 2 millimeters to 1 centimeter in diameter ) . Ecchymoses also have a more diffuse border than other purpura .   Cause   There are many causes of subcutaneous hematomas including ecchymoses . Coagulopathies such as Hemophilia A may cause ecchymosis formation in children .   Etymology and pronunciation   The word ecchymosis ( ; plural ecchymoses , ) comes to English from New Latin , based on Greek ekchym\u014dsis , from ekchymousthai `` to extravasate blood '' , from ex- ( elided to e- ) and chymos , `` juice '' .

Rock and roll   Rock and roll dominated popular music in the later half of the 1950s . The musical style originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s , and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world . Its immediate origins lay in a mixing together of various black musical genres of the time , including rhythm and blues and gospel music ; with country and western and Pop . In 1951 , Cleveland , Ohio disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience , and is credited with first using the phrase `` rock and roll '' to describe the music .   The 1950s saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar ( developed and popularized by Les Paul ) . Paul 's hit records like `` How High the Moon '' , and `` The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise '' , helped lead to the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing of such exponents as Chuck Berry , Link Wray , and Scotty Moore . Chuck Berry , who is considered to be one of the pioneers of Rock and roll music , refined and developed the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive , focusing on teen life and introducing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.M .

Artists such as Chuck Berry , Bo Diddley , Fats Domino , Little Richard , Jerry Lee Lewis , Big Joe Turner , and Gene Vincent released the initial rhythm and blues-influenced early rock and roll hits . Rock and roll forerunners in the popular music field included Johnnie Ray , The Crew-Cuts , The Fontane Sisters , and Les Paul and Mary Ford . The Rock and Roll Era is generally dated from 25 March 1955 premiere of the motion picture , `` The Blackboard Jungle '' . This film \u2019 s use of Bill Haley and His Comets ' `` ( We \u2019 re Gon na ) Rock Around the Clock '' over its opening credits , caused a national sensation when teenagers started dancing in the aisles .   Pat Boone became one of the most successful artists of the 50s with his heavily Pop-influenced `` covers '' of R & B hits like `` Two Hearts , Two Kisses ( Make One Love ) '' , `` Ai n't That a Shame '' , and `` At My Front Door ( Crazy Little Mama ) '' . Boone 's traditional pop approach to rock and roll , coupled with his All-American , clean-cut image helped bring the new sound to a much wider audience . Elvis Presley , who began his career in the mid-1950s , soon became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances , motion pictures , and chart-topping records . His energized interpretations of songs , many from African American sources , and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial during that period . Boone and Presley 's styles/images represented opposite ends of the burgeoning musical form , which competed with one another throughout the remainder of the decade .   In 1957 , a popular television show featuring rock and roll performers , American Bandstand , went national . Hosted by Dick Clark , the program helped to popularize the more clean-cut , All-American brand of rock and roll . By the end of the decade , teen idols like Bobby Darin , Ricky Nelson , Frankie Avalon , Paul Anka , Neil Sedaka , Bobby Rydell , Connie Francis , and Fabian Forte were topping the charts .

The matriarch of the Munster household , Lily is a vampire . The role was later played by Lee Meriwether in The Munsters Today and by Portia de Rossi in Mockingbird Lane .   In the original unaired color pilot her name was Phoebe Munster .   Origins   Lily was born in 1827 to Sam Dracula ( Grandpa ) and his 166th wife ( referred to only as `` Grandma '' ) . She lived with Grandpa for some time in Transylvania ( a region in Romania ) before meeting Herman Munster and marrying him in 1865 . She , Grandpa , and Herman moved to America sometime before the mid-1940s and adopted her sister 's child , Marilyn . In the mid-1950s , she gave birth to Eddie , her and Herman 's only child .

She has a werewolf for a brother , who appears in one episode , and a sister who is mentioned a few times who is Marilyn 's mother .

While she is deeply in love with Herman ( `` Pussycat , '' as she calls him ) , she also frequently gets very angry at him ( due to his frequent stupidity and occasional selfishness ) , and Herman often meekly discloses his fear ( to others ) of being on the receiving end of her wrath . She also has reprimanded her own father ( Grandpa ) on several occasions for his own foolish actions and stubborn self-righteousness .   Lily treats her niece Marilyn as her own daughter , but shares the family 's concern that Marilyn 's `` hideousness '' is going to condemn her to a spinster 's life . As such , she is very much in favor of Marilyn dating , and is very accommodating to Marilyn 's fleeting beaus despite their `` rudeness . '' ( What Lily is perceiving as lack of manners is in fact the young man 's terror of seeing Marilyn 's monstrous relatives ) .   Lily is very supportive of her son , Eddie , and keeps a close eye on his activities and social circle .   Lily is mainly a housewife , and her duties include spreading garbage around the mansion and `` dusting '' with a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse so that it blows dirt about in the nine-room-and-a-dungeon house . During the course of the series , Lily works as a welder in a shipyard , a fashion model , and a palm reader in a tea room . In one episode she forces Herman to give her money so that she and Marilyn can open a beauty parlor , but this soon goes out of business , as Lily assumes her clientele wants to look more like her . These part-time jobs never seem to stick , and Lily would be back to being a homemaker by the next episode .   Lily is a beautiful and slender woman who appears to be in her middle age years , although she is actually hundreds of years old . Later incarnations of the character , played by different actresses , would change her skin from green to pale white . A white streak in her hair recalls the monster 's mate from Bride of Frankenstein . Lily usually dresses in an ankle-length pale pink gown that appears faded and old , and she sometimes also wears a scarf . Her necklace features a bat-shaped medallion . When away from the Munster house , she sometimes wears a long silver cape with a hood . In the episode `` Munsters Masquerade '' , Lily demonstrates the ability to float in the air while dancing .

Mark Little left the programme in July 1996 , following press reports that he and Zo\u00eb Ball had fallen out . Little was replaced by Keith Chegwin , who himself exited the programme in August 1996 , just ahead of a massive relaunch . In an attempt to stem the sliding viewing figures , the Big Breakfast house was refurbished at a cost of \u00a32 million .

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural , and military force in Europe . Both `` Byzantine Empire '' and `` Eastern Roman Empire '' are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire ( , tr . ; ) , or Romania ( ) , and to themselves as `` Romans '' .   Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West divided . Constantine I ( r. 324\u2013337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital , and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379\u2013395 ) , Christianity became the Empire 's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . Finally , under the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610\u2013641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin . Thus , although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture , and characterised by Orthodox Christianity .   The borders of the Empire evolved significantly over its existence , as it went through several cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527\u2013565 ) , the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy , and Rome itself , which it held for two more centuries . During the reign of Maurice ( r. 582\u2013602 ) , the Empire 's eastern frontier was expanded and the north stabilised . However , his assassination caused the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628 , which exhausted the Empire 's resources and contributed to major territorial losses during the Muslim conquests of the seventh century . In a matter of years the Empire lost its richest provinces , Egypt and Syria , to the Arabs .   During the Macedonian dynasty ( 10th\u201311th centuries ) , the Empire again expanded and experienced the two-century long Macedonian Renaissance , which came to an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . This battle opened the way for the Turks to settle in Anatolia as a homeland .   The Empire recovered again during the Komnenian restoration , such that by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city . However , it was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade , when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 and the territories that the Empire formerly governed were divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms . Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261 , the Byzantine Empire remained only one of several small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence . Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century . The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 finally ended the Byzantine Empire .   Nomenclature   The first use of the term `` Byzantine '' to label the later years of the Roman Empire was in 1557 , when the German historian Hieronymus Wolf published his work Corpus Histori\u00e6 Byzantin\u00e6 , a collection of historical sources . The term comes from `` Byzantium '' , the name of the city of Constantinople before it became Constantine 's capital . This older name of the city would rarely be used from this point onward except in historical or poetic contexts . The publication in 1648 of the Byzantine du Louvre ( Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae ) , and in 1680 of Du Cange 's Historia Byzantina further popularised the use of `` Byzantine '' among French authors , such as Montesquieu . However , it was not until the mid-19th century that the term came into general use in the Western world .   The Byzantine Empire was known to its inhabitants as the ``", "modContext": "During the Late Antiquity and Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire in Europe continued as the Byzantine Empire, with Constantinople (now Istanbul) as its capital city.The Western Roman Empire's collapse and fragmentation in the 5th century AD did not put an end to its existence, which persisted for a thousand years before being conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1453.The empire held the position of Europe's most potent economic, cultural, and military power for a considerable duration.The Byzantine Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire are both historical expressions that were coined after the kingdom's demise;The inhabitants of the region continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire.It follows that;Romania and the Romans refer to themselves as \"Romans\".The division of the Greek East and Latin West in the Roman Empire occurred during the transition period from the 4th to the 6th centuries, accompanied by several signal events.The reign of Constantine I was marked by significant events.Constantinople was chosen as the new capital, the empire was restructured between 324 and 337, and Christianity was legalized.During the reign of Theodosius I,During the period of 379-395, Christianity was declared the official state religion of the Empire and other religious practices were prohibited.Finally, during the reign of Heraclius (r.),In the years 610-641, the military and administration of the Empire were reorganized and officially adopted Greek instead of Latin.Modern historians argue that Byzantium differed from ancient Rome due to its focus on Constantinople, Greek culture, and Orthodox Christianity, despite the continued continuation of Roman state traditions.The Empire's borders underwent a significant transformation throughout its existence, experiencing various periods of decline and recovery.In the time of Justinian I ( r.After reconquering much of the western Mediterranean coast, including North Africa, Italy, and Rome, which it had held for two centuries, the Empire reached its greatest extent between 527 and 565.Under the leadership of Maurice ( r.Between 582 and 602, the Empire's eastern frontier was expanded and the north stabilized.The Byzantine-Sasanian War of 602-628 was triggered by his assassination, which led to significant territorial losses and depletion for the Empire during the Muslim conquests of the seventh century.The Arabs took over the Empire's most prosperous provinces, namely Egypt and Syria, in a short period of time.The Macedonian dynasty, which lasted from the 10th to 11th centuries, saw the Empire expand once more and witness the Macedon Renaissance, a period that ended with the Seljuk Turks' takeover of Asia Minor in 1071 at the Battle of Manzikert.The battle paved the way for the Turks to establish themselves as a nation in Anatolia.Constantinople became the most prosperous and affluent European city by the 12th century, thanks to the Komnenian restoration that revived the Empire.Nevertheless, it suffered a fatal setback during the Fourth Crusade, when Constantinople was toppled in 1204 and the Empire's territories were split into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms.Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire was one of several small rival states in the region for the last two centuries of its existence.The Ottomans gradually absorbed the territories that were left over during the 15th century.In 1453, the Byzantine Empire was brought to a close by the Ottoman Empire's fall of Constantinople.The term \"Byzantine\" was first used to describe the later years of the Roman Empire in 1557, when German historian Hieronymus Wolf published Corpus Histori Byzantin, a collection of historical sources.The word was coined from the name of the city that Constantinople was known as \"Byzantium\" before it became the capital of Constantine.The city's older name would seldom be used after this point, except in historical or poetic contexts.Montesquieu and other French writers found the use of the term \"Byzantine\" to gain acceptance.The term did not become widely used in the Western world until the mid-19th century.", "question": "what is the name of 11 roman emperors, the first of which transferred the capital to byzantium in 330 ad, and the last of which died when it was captured by the turks in 1453?", "groundTruth": "constantine", "answer": "Constantine I and Constantine XI.", "modAnswer": "The name of the 11 Roman emperors, the first of which transferred the capital to Byzantium in 330 AD, and the last of which died when it was captured by the Turks in 1453, are:\n\n1.

The term ' is Medieval Latin , which means in the year of the Lord but is often translated as in the year of our Lord . It is occasionally set out more fully as ' ( or Jesu ) ' ( `` in the year of Our Lord Jesus Christ '' ) .  Dionysius Exiguus of Scythia Minor introduced the AD system in AD 525 , counting the years since the birth of Christ .   This calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth , with AD counting years from the start of this epoch , and BC denoting years before the start of the era . There is no year zero in this scheme , so the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1 BC . This dating system was devised in 525 , but was not widely used until after 800 .   The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today . For decades , it has been the unofficial global standard , adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication , transportation , and commercial integration , and recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations .   Traditionally , English followed Latin usage by placing the `` AD '' abbreviation before the year number . However , BC is placed after the year number ( for example : AD , but 68 BC ) , which also preserves syntactic order . The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium , as in `` fourth century AD '' or `` second millennium AD '' ( although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions ) . Because BC is the English abbreviation for Before Christ , it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means After Death , i.e. , after the death of Jesus . However , this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would not be included in either of the BC and the AD time scales .   Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current , or Common Era ( abbreviated as CE or C.E . ) , with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common , Christian , or Current Era ( BCE or B.C.E . ) . Astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity , but use the same numbers for AD years .   History   The Anno Domini dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus to enumerate the years in his Easter table . His system was to replace the Diocletian era that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians . The last year of the old table , Diocletian 247 , was immediately followed by the first year of his table , AD 532 . When he devised his table , Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year\u2014he himself stated that the `` present year '' was `` the consulship of Probus Junior '' , which was 525 years `` since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ '' . Thus Dionysius implied that Jesus ' Incarnation occurred 525 years earlier , without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred . `` However , nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system , whether consulate , Olympiad , year of the world , or regnal year of Augustus ; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date . ''   Blackburn & Holford-Strevens briefly present arguments for 2 BC , 1 BC , or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the Nativity or Incarnation . Among the sources of confusion are :  * In modern times , Incarnation is synonymous with the conception , but some ancient writers , such as Bede , considered Incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity  * The civil , or consular year began on 1 January but the Diocletian year began on 29 August ( 30 August in the year before a Julian leap year ) .  * There were inaccuracies in the list of consuls  * There were confused summations of emperors ' regnal years", "modContext": "The words ( AD or A.)D.Prior to Christ's arrival in BC or B.A.The Julian and Gregorian calendars employ the marking or numbering of years.\"The term 'in the year of the Lord' is derived from Medieval Latin and typically signifies the same year as our Lord.\"The term can be more accurately referred to as \"( or Jesu )\" (in the year of Our Lord Jesus Christ).The AD system, which counts the years since Christ's birth, was introduced by Dionysius Exiguus of Scythia Minor in AD 525.The traditional year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth is used to calculate the era's duration, with AD and BC starting from this date.The year AD 1 is immediately followed by the year 1 BC in this system, as there is no year zero.The emergence of this dating system occurred in 525, but it was not widely adopted until the 8th century.The Gregorian calendar is the most commonly used calendar in the world today.It has been the unofficial global standard for many years, used in the practical context of international communication, transportation and commercial integration, and is recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations.In the past, English has traditionally used the abbreviation  AD's before the year number in Latin.BC is positioned after the year number, such as AD but not 68 BC, which also ensures proper syntactic organization.After a century or millennium, the abbreviation is commonly employed, such as \"AD 400\" or \"AAD 200,\" which was previously considered offensive in conservative usage.Due to the English abbreviation of Before Christ, AD is sometimes mistakenly referred to as After Death.e.Following the death of Jesus.The time scales of the BC and AD would not account for the roughly 33 years that Jesus' life was commonly referred to.A terminology that some consider to be more neutral and inclusive of non-Christians is known as the Current or Common Era.E.The preceding years are referred to as Before the Common, Christian, or Current Era ( BCE or B).C.E.)The numbering of astronomical years and ISO 8601 guidelines avoid using Christian abbreviations or words, but adhere to the same numerical values for AD years.Dionysius Exiguus created the Anno Domini dating system in 525 to determine the number of years on his Easter table.The Diocletian era that was once discussed in an old Easter table would be replaced by his system, as he did not want to perpetuate the image of a dictator who persecuted Christians.AD 532 marked the beginning of his table, which was preceded by the last year of Diocletian 247.At the time he created his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming which consuls were in office that year\u2014He himself stated that the current year was \"consulship of Probus Junior\", 525 years after Christ's incarnation.Dionysius proposed that Jesus' Incarnation took place 525 years earlier, but did not specify the exact year of his birth or conception.Despite the absence of any references to other dating systems, Dionysius' table does not provide any indication of his time period, whether it be consul, Olympiad, year of the world, or Augustus\u2019 regnal year.He neglects to clarify or rationalize the underlying date.Blackburn & Holford-Strevens provide brief arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC or AD 1 as the year in which Dionysius intended to create either the Nativity or Incarnation.Among the confusions, Incarnation is now considered to be synonymous with conception, but some ancient writers like Bede believed that it was actually connected to the Nativity.", "question": "238 ad is known in roman history as the year of the ........

Cremation urns were also commonly used in early Anglo Saxon England , and in many Pre-Columbian cultures .

Tea-urns are frequently used in catering to serve tea or coffee, even though they are typically made of metal cylinders with practical applications.Whether placed outside, in gardens, as architectural ornaments on buildings, or kept inside, large sculpted vases are commonly referred to as urns.The use of funerary urns, also known as cinerary or burial ones, has been observed in many cultures.The remains of the deceased were cremated by the survivors and the ashes were placed in an urn after their funeral.In China, an early Jiahu site has yielded pottery urns dating back to around 7000 BC, along with 32 burial ashes found in Laoguantai, Shaanxi.Over 700 burial urns have been discovered in the Yangshao region, with over 50 types of shapes and sizes.While children were the primary use of burial urns, adults were also utilized on occasion.The Urnfield civilization ( circa.The culture of 1300 BC to 750 BC, which was a product of the late Bronze Age in central Europe, is named after its vast sites of urn burials.The discovery of a Bronze Age burial site in Norfolk, England was followed by Sir Thomas Browne's description of the antiquities.He enlarged his research to examine burial and funerary practices, both past and present, and published it as Hydriotaphia or Urn Burial in 1658.In ancient Greece, it was customary to burn the remains in a painted Greek vase.The lekythos, a vase-like structure, was utilized to store oil in funerary rituals.A columbarium, a collective tomb, was where the Romans placed the urns in ledges.Doves are commonly placed in niches within dovecotes.Early Anglo Saxon England and Pre-Columbian cultures frequently utilized cremation urns.In later European traditions, a king's heart and organs may be placed in one or more urns after his death, as was the case with King Otto of Bavaria in 1916, and then interred elsewhere to signify remembrance by the deceased.The modern funeral industry offers cremation urns of different quality, complexity, and cost, which could potentially harm traditional burial traditions.Biodegradable urns are sometimes used for burial of both humans and animals.Paper, salt, cellulose, and other natural materials are utilized in their production, which can decompose into organic matter and serve as a seed for the growth of flora.In addition to the standard funeral or cremation ashes urns, it is feasible to keep a portion of the departed person's ash in valuable jewelry or small utensils.The ashes of two people may be placed in what are called companion urns.http: //artisurn.The urns used for cremation or funeral purposes can be made from a range of materials, including wood, stone, ceramic, glass, or steel.The practice of scattering ashes has become widespread in recent times.The outcome was the creation of urns that would disperse cremated remains.A few of them are eco-conscious, cost-effective, and can be repurposed after being utilized.A vase or larger container with a figure-like shape, such as figural urns, is created by using either the classic amphora or crucible style as the base.These can either be attached to the main body as handles or embellishments, or displayed in relief on the body.", "question": "what, loosely translating as 'self-boiler', is a traditional metal russian tea urn called?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "A traditional metal Russian tea urn is called a \"samovar.\"", "modAnswer": "A traditional metal Russian tea urn is called a \"samovar.\"", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[3, 0.597262978553772], [1, 0.43450820446014404], [0, 0.38864830136299133], [10, 0.3588308095932007], [26, 0.30568575859069824], [15, 0.3016549348831177], [30, 0.2888489365577698], [18, 0.2802762985229492], [4, 0.2692859470844269], [2, 0.26157665252685547], [11, 0.25983938574790955], [28, 0.2501443028450012], [22, 0.20580828189849854], [7, 0.2007872611284256], [5, 0.19499647617340088], [21, 0.1940012276172638], [12, 0.19348987936973572], [14, 0.17872551083564758], [24, 0.17763802409172058], [25, 0.1645115613937378], [23, 0.13120439648628235], [9, 0.12896975874900818], [20, 0.12499668449163437], [13, 0.12056009471416473], [19, 0.11296367645263672], [6, 0.10755454748868942], [16, 0.10082951188087463], [31, 0.08826693147420883], [8, 0.08655060082674026], [29, 0.07682307809591293], [27, 0.04029349982738495], [17, -0.0033150631934404373]]}, {"test case number": 101, "context": "William Buckland DD FRS ( 12 March 1784 \u2013 14 August 1856 ) was an English theologian who became Dean of Westminster . He was also a geologist and palaeontologist , writing the first full account of a fossil dinosaur , which he named Megalosaurus . His work proving that Kirkdale Cave had been a prehistoric hyena den , for which he was awarded the Copley Medal , was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct events from the distant past . He was a pioneer in the use of fossilised faeces , for which he coined the term coprolites , to reconstruct ancient ecosystems .   Buckland was a proponent of the Gap Theory that interpreted the biblical account of Genesis as referring to two separate episodes of creation separated by a lengthy period ; it emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a way to reconcile the scriptural account with discoveries in geology that suggested the earth was very old . Early in his career he believed that he had found geological evidence of the biblical flood , but later became convinced that the glaciation theory of Louis Agassiz provided a better explanation , and he played an important role in promoting that theory in Great Britain .   Early life and university   Buckland was born at Axminster in DevonChisholm , 1911 and , as a child , would accompany his father , the Rector of Templeton and Trusham , on his walks where interest in road improvements led to collecting fossil shells , including ammonites , from the Jurassic lias rocks exposed in local quarries .   He was educated first at Blundell 's School , Tiverton , Devon , and then at Winchester College , from where in 1801 he won a scholarship to study for the ministry at Corpus Christi College , Oxford , also attending the lectures of John Kidd on mineralogy and chemistry , as well as developing an interest in geology and carrying out field research on strata , during vacations . Having taken his BA in 1804 , he went on to obtain his MA degree in 1808 . He then became a Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1809 , was ordained as a priest and continued to make frequent geological excursions , on horseback , to various parts of England , Scotland , Ireland and Wales . In 1813 , he was appointed reader in mineralogy , in succession to John Kidd , giving lively and popular lectures with increasing emphasis on geology and palaeontology . As ( unofficial ) curator of the Ashmolean Museum , he built up collections , touring Europe and coming into contact with scientists including Georges Cuvier .   Rejection of flood geology and Kirkdale Cave   In 1818 , Buckland was elected a fellow of the Royal Society . That year he persuaded the Prince Regent to endow an additional Readership , this time in Geology and he became the first holder of the new appointment , delivering his inaugural address on 15 May 1819 . This was published in 1820 as Vindici\u00e6 Geologi\u00e6 ; or the Connexion of Geology with Religion explained , both justifying the new science of geology and reconciling geological evidence with the biblical accounts of creation and Noah 's Flood . At a time when others were coming under the opposing influence of James Hutton 's theory of uniformitarianism , Buckland developed a new hypothesis that the word `` beginning '' in Genesis meant an undefined period between the origin of the earth and the creation of its current inhabitants , during which a long series of extinctions and successive creations of new kinds of plants and animals had occurred . Thus , his catastrophism theory incorporated a version of Old Earth creationism or Gap creationism . Buckland believed in a global deluge during the time of Noah but was not a supporter of flood geology as he believed that only a small amount of the strata could have been formed in the single year occupied by the deluge .   From his investigations of fossil bones at Kirkdale Cave , in Yorkshire , he concluded that the cave had actually been inhabited by hyaenas in antediluvian times , and that the fossils were the remains of these hyaenas and the animals they had eaten , rather than being remains of animals that had perished in the Flood and then carried from the tropics by the surging waters , as he and others had at first thought .

Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports , with events in butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke , freestyle , and individual medley . In addition to these individual events , Olympic swimmers also participate in relays . Swimmers can also compete in open-water events ( i.e . swimming in the Ocean ) .   History   Evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has been found , with the earliest evidence dating to Stone Age paintings from around 10000 years ago . Written references date from 2000 BC , with some of the earliest references to swimming including the Iliad , the Odyssey , the Bible , Beowulf , the Quran and others . In 1538 , Nikolaus Wynmann , a German professor of languages , wrote the first swimming book , The Swimmer or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming ( Der Schwimmer oder ein Zweigespr\u00e4ch \u00fcber die Schwimmkunst ) .   Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England . In 1828 , the first indoor swimming pool , St George 's Baths was opened to the public . By 1837 , the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools , built around London . The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880 , when the first national governing body , the Amateur Swimming Association , was formed , there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country .   In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming competition in London introduced the front crawl to a Western audience . Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from some South American natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873 , winning a local competition in England . His stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today .   Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel ( between England and France ) , in 1875 . Using the breaststroke technique , he swam the channel in 21 hours and 45 minutes . His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years , until T.W . Burgess made the crossing in 1911 .   Other European countries also established swimming federations ; Germany in 1882 , France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896 . The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna . The world 's first women 's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892 .   Men 's swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens . In 1902 , the Australian Richmond Cavill introduced the front crawl to the Western world . In 1908 , the world swimming association , F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation ( FINA ) , was formed . Women 's swimming was introduced into the Olympics in 1912 . Butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was at first a variant of breaststroke , until it was accepted as a separate style in 1952 .   Competitive swimming   Competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century . The goal of competitive swimming is to break personal or world records while beating competitors in any given event . Swimming in competition should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed . However , some professional swimmers who do not hold a national or world ranking are considered the best in regard to their technical skills . Typically , an athlete goes through a cycle of training in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the cycle , and then the workload is decreased in the final stage as the swimmer approaches competition .   The practice of reducing exercise in the days just before an important competition is called tapering . A final stage is often referred to as `` shave and taper '' : the swimmer shaves off all exposed hair for the sake of reducing drag and having a sleeker and more hydrodynamic feel in the water .

American competitors who participated in a swimming competition in London.After being impressed by the hand-over stroke practiced by South American natives, Sir John Arthur Trudgen successfully introduced the new stroke in 1873 at a local competition in England.His stroke is still considered the most potent tool to use today.In 1875, Captain Matthew Webb became the first person to swim the

Culinary origin   Belgium   Some claim that fries originated in Belgium , and that the ongoing dispute between the French and Belgians about where they were invented is highly contentious , with both countries claiming ownership . From the Belgian standpoint the popularity of the term `` French fries '' is explained as a `` French gastronomic hegemony '' into which the cuisine of Belgium was assimilated because of a lack of understanding coupled with a shared language and geographic proximity between the two countries .   Belgian journalist Jo G\u00e9rard claims that a 1781 family manuscript recounts that potatoes were deep-fried prior to 1680 in the Meuse valley , in what was then the Spanish Netherlands ( present-day Belgium ) : `` The inhabitants of Namur , Andenne , and Dinant had the custom of fishing in the Meuse for small fish and frying , especially among the poor , but when the river was frozen and fishing became hazardous , they cut potatoes in the form of small fish and put them in a fryer like those here .

At most they were saut\u00e9ed in a pan ... '' .   Some people believe that the term `` French '' was introduced when British and American soldiers arrived in Belgium during World War I and consequently tasted Belgian fries . They supposedly called them `` French '' , as it was the local language and the official language of the Belgian Army at that time , believing themselves to be in France . At that time , the term `` French fries '' was growing popular . But in fact the term was already used in America as early as 1899 , in an item in Good Housekeeping which specifically references `` Kitchen Economy in France '' : `` The perfection of French fries is due chiefly to the fact that plenty of fat is used '' .   `` Pommes frites '' , `` frites '' ( French ) , or ``", "modContext": "Batonnet or allumette cut potato, also known as deep-fried potatoes, are commonly used in place of French fries, chips, Indian chips and other dishes.In the United States and most of Canada, fries are referred to as fried, long-cut pieces of elongated potatoes, while shoestring fries can be found in other countries like the UK, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, and New Zealand.Fast food restaurants often include French fries on their menus as part of their lunch or dinner dishes, and they are usually served hot and crispy, either soft or crunchy, or as a snack.The usual accompaniment for French fries is ketchup, which is usually added and they are salted;In numerous nations, other condiments or toppings like vinegar, mayonnaise, or other local specialties are used as a topside.Poutine and chili cheese fries are examples of dishes that can be topped with more elaborate ingredients.Instead of potatoes, sweet potatoes can be used to make French fries.A baked version of the french fry is also made, typically without excessive oil or fat.Thomas Jefferson provided potatoes in the French style at a White House dinner in 1802.In 1856, the phrase  French Fried Potatoes'' was first printed in English in Cookery for Maids of All Work by E Warren.Slice new potatoes into thin strips and place them in a pan of fat, salt and pour it over.Fry the sides until a light golden brown color is achieved;Eliminate waste through drainage.During the early 1900s, the term \"French fried\" was being used to describe other foods like chicken and onion rings, which were also called \"deep-fried.\"Although French fried potatoes are the most well-known dish, it is unlikely that this term actually refers to frenching in the sense of julienning.In the past, frenching was solely concerned with removing meat from the shanks of chops.The origin of fries is believed by some to have originated in Belgium, and the debate over their country of origin has been ongoing due to claims from both French and Belgians.According to the Belgian perspective, the adoption of the term \"French fries\" suggests a dominant French culinary culture that was influenced by mutual ignorance and geographic proximity between France and Belgium.According to Jo G\u00e9rard, a journalist from Belgium, potatoes were deep-fried in the Meuse valley before 1680.The absence of a manuscript by G\u00e9rard supports this assertion, but it is unrelated to the French fry's later history.In the context of 18th century economic conditions, it is highly unlikely that a peasant would use significant amounts of fat in preparation for cooking potatoes.The pan was the only source of sauteed vegetables.The.The.\"''It is believed by some that the term  French '' was coined during World War I when British and American soldiers arrived in Belgium and consumed Belgian fries.Supposedly, they were called  French because it was the official language of the Belgian Army during that period and they believed themselves to be in France.French fries, which were referred to as \"flavor fries,\" became increasingly popular during that period.The term \"Kitchen Economy in France\" was mentioned in Good Housekeeping as early as 1899, highlighting the importance of high fat content in making French fries.", "question": "from which country do french fries originate? france, belgium or switzerland?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "Belgium.", "modAnswer": "Belgium.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[16, 0.7961686253547668], [25, 0.7012621760368347], [17, 0.6891223192214966], [27, 0.6497533321380615], [1, 0.6297580003738403], [18, 0.5784153342247009], [28, 0.5719516277313232], [0, 0.5600751042366028], [14, 0.5370481014251709], [2, 0.5242513418197632], [3, 0.5201878547668457], [6, 0.5162286758422852], [7, 0.4978489279747009], [9, 0.4835193157196045], [5, 0.46512842178344727], [26, 0.45270729064941406], [13, 0.44555342197418213], [8, 0.37552526593208313], [19, 0.3452826738357544], [15, 0.31615808606147766], [11, 0.3105715215206146], [4, 0.28454825282096863], [20, 0.27912336587905884], [21, 0.20725935697555542], [10, 0.18013957142829895], [22, 0.11914101243019104], [23, 0.11914101243019104], [24, 0.11904232203960419], [12, -0.027076594531536102]]}, {"test case number": 109, "context": "John Marwood Cleese ( ; born 27 October 1939 ) is an English actor , comedian , writer , and film producer .

His family 's surname was originally Cheese , but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the Army during World War I .   As a child , Cleese supported Bristol City Football Club and Somerset County Cricket Club . Cleese was educated at St Peter 's Preparatory School , where he received a prize for English studies and did well at cricket and boxing . When he was 13 , he was awarded an exhibition at Clifton College , an English public school in Bristol . He was already more than 6 feet ( 1.83 m ) tall by then . He allegedly defaced the school grounds , as a prank , by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of Field Marshal Earl Haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet . Cleese played cricket in the First XI and did well academically , passing 8 O-Levels and 3 A-Levels in mathematics , physics , and chemistry . In his autobiography So , Anyway he says that discovering , aged 17 , he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster , Billy Williams , affected his outlook .

He then took up a place he had won at Downing College , Cambridge to read Law . He also joined the Cambridge Footlights . He recalled that he went to the Cambridge Guildhall , where each university society had a stall , and went up to the Footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance . He replied `` no '' as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad , and if there was anything worse than his singing it was his dancing . He was then asked `` Well , what do you do ? `` , to which he replied , `` I make people laugh '' .   At the Footlights theatrical club he spent a lot of time with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Bill Oddie and met his future writing partner Graham Chapman . Cleese wrote extra material for the 1961 Footlights Revue I Thought I Saw It Move , and was Registrar for the Footlights Club during 1962 .

The genre has also been described as possessing `` a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years '' . This view sees the novel 's origins in Classical Greece and Rome , medieval , early modern romance , and the tradition of the novella . The latter , an Italian word used to describe short stories , supplied the present generic English term in the 18th century . Ian Watt , however , in The Rise of the Novel ( 1957 ) suggests that the novel first came into being in the early 18th century ,   Miguel de Cervantes , author of Don Quixote , is frequently cited as the first significant European novelist of the modern era ; the first part of Don Quixote was published in 1605 .   The romance is a closely related long prose narrative . Walter Scott defined it as `` a fictitious narrative in prose or verse ; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents '' , whereas in the novel `` the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society '' . However , many romances , including the historical romances of Scott , Emily Bront\u00eb 's Wuthering Heights and Herman Melville 's Moby-Dick , are also frequently called novels , and Scott describes romance as a `` kindred term '' . Romance , as defined here , should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or romance novel . Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel : `` a novel is le roman , der Roman , il romanzo . ''   Defining the genre   A novel is a long , fictional narrative which describes intimate human experiences . The novel in the modern era usually makes use of a literary prose style , and the development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in printing , and the introduction of cheap paper , in the 15th century .   The present English ( and Spanish ) word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian novella for `` new '' , `` news '' , or `` short story of something new '' , itself from the Latin novella , a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus , diminutive of novus , meaning `` new '' . Most European languages use the word `` romance '' ( as in French , Dutch , Russian , Serbo-Croatian , Romanian , Danish , Swedish and Norwegian `` roman '' ; German `` Roman '' ; Portuguese `` romance '' and Italian `` romanzo '' ) for extended narratives .   A fictional narrative   Fictionality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from historiography . However this can be a problematic criterion . Throughout the early modern period authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion . Historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes . Novels can , on the other hand , depict the social , political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history .   Literary prose   While prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel , the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the Romance language of southern France , especially those by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes ( late 12th century ) , and in Middle English ( Geoffrey Chaucer 's ( c. 1343 \u2013 1400 ) The Canterbury Tales ) .

Vikram Seth 's The Golden Gate ( 1986 ) , composed of 590 Onegin stanzas , is a more recent example of the verse novel .   Content : intimate experience   Both in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe , prose fiction created intimate reading situations .

The present-day location is known as Hisarl\u0131k . It was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle , in particular in the Iliad , one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer . Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey suggests that the name ( Ilion ) formerly began with a digamma : ( Wilion ) ; this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city , Wilusa .   A new capital called Ilium was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus . It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople and declined gradually in the Byzantine era .   In 1865 , English archaeologist Frank Calvert excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarl\u0131k , and in 1868 , Heinrich Schliemann , a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist , also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in \u00c7anakkale . These excavations revealed several cities built in succession . Schliemann was at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy , but was persuaded by Calvert and took over Calvert 's excavations on the eastern half of the Hisarlik site , which was on Calvert 's property . Troy VII has been identified with the Hittite city Wilusa , the probable origin of the Greek \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , and is generally ( but not conclusively ) identified with Homeric Troy .   Today , the hill at Hisarl\u0131k has given its name to a small village near the ruins , which supports the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site . It lies within the province of \u00c7anakkale , some 30 km south-west of the provincial capital , also called \u00c7anakkale . The nearest village is Tevfikiye . The map here shows the adapted Scamander estuary with Ilium a little way inland across the Homeric plain .   Troy was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998 .   Homeric Troy   Ancient Greek historians variously placed the Trojan War in the 12th , 13th , or 14th centuries BC : Eratosthenes to 1184 BC , Herodotus to 1250 BC , Duris of Samos to 1334 BC . Modern archaeologists associate Homeric Troy with archaeological Troy VII .   In the Iliad , the Achaeans set up their camp near the mouth of the River Scamander ( presumably modern Karamenderes ) , where they had beached their ships . The city of Troy itself stood on a hill , across the plain of Scamander , where the battles of the Trojan War took place . The site of the ancient city is some 5 km from the coast today , but 3,000 years ago the mouths of Scamander were much closer to the city , discharging into a large bay that formed a natural harbour and which has since been filled with alluvial material . Recent geological findings have permitted the identification of the ancient Trojan coastline , and the results largely confirm the accuracy of the Homeric geography of Troy .   In November 2001 , the geologist John C. Kraft from the University of Delaware and the classicist John V. Luce from Trinity College , Dublin , presented the results of investigations , begun in 1977 , into the geology of the region . They compared the present geology with the landscapes and coastal features described in the Iliad and other classical sources , notably Strabo 's Geographia , and concluded that there is a regular consistency between the location of Schliemann 's Troy and other locations such as the Greek camp , the geological evidence , descriptions of the topography and accounts of the battle in the Iliad .   Besides the Iliad , there are references to Troy in the other major work attributed to Homer , the Odyssey , as well as in other ancient Greek literature ( such as Aeschylus ' Oresteia ) .

Later, in 1868, Heinrich Schliemann, renowned German businessman and arch\u00e4ologist began to dig in the area after meeting Calf in their hometown of anakkale.The excavations uncovered multiple cities that were built in succession.Initially, Schliemann was doubtful about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy, but Calvert convinced him and took control of his excavations on the eastern half of the Hisrlik site.Wilusa, the Hittite city that likely gave birth to the Greek word, is now associated with Troy VII, which is also commonly referred to as Homeric Troy.The Troia archaeological site's tourist industry is supported by a small village near the ruins, which has been named after the hill at Hisarlk.It is situated in the province of anakkale, which is located some 30 km to the south-west of the provincial capital.The nearest village is Tevfikiye.The map displayed here depicts the adapted Scamander estuary and Ilium located a little ways back across the Homeric plain.The UNESCO World Heritage list was added to Troy in 1998.The Trojan War was placed in the timeline of the Homeric Troy by various Ancient Greek historians, with Eratosthenes slated for 1184 BC, Herodotus for 1250 BC and Duris of Samos for 1334 BC.Archaeologists of today associate the Homeric Troy region with archaeological Troy VII.In the Iliad, the Achaeans established a camp near the River Scamander's mouth, which is believed to be the present-day Karamenderes, where their ships were beached.The city of Troy was situated on a hillside, across from the plain of Scamander, where the Trojan War's battles were conducted.The ancient city's location is approximately 5 km from the present coast, but 3,000 years ago, it was closer to the mouths of Scamander, which formed a natural harbour and were now filled with sediment.Recent geological discoveries have enabled the identification of the coastline in ancient Troy, which supports the accuracy of Homeric geography.November 2001 saw the arrival of geologist John C.Classicist John V and Kraft from the University of Delaware.Luce, who was associated with Trinity College in Dublin, showcased the results of research conducted on the geology of the area since 1977.After reviewing the landscapes and coastal features described in both the Iliad and classical sources such as Strabo's Geographi, they concluded that there is consistent consistency between the location of Schliemann'Storage (Schlutzag) and other locations.The Odyssey and other ancient Greek literature, in addition to the Iliad, contain mentions of Troy.In his Aeneid, Virgil elaborates on the Homeric legend of Troy.", "question": "the archaeological site of the ancient city of troy is in which country?", "groundTruth": "turkey", "answer": "The archaeological site of the ancient city of Troy is in modern-day Turkey.", "modAnswer": "Turkey.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[21, 0.7413163185119629], [14, 0.6477389335632324], [25, 0.5886812806129456], [0, 0.5295861959457397], [31, 0.5086987614631653], [23, 0.5035370588302612], [12, 0.5011360049247742], [19, 0.47686246037483215], [29, 0.4555314779281616], [20, 0.44724851846694946], [15, 0.43213433027267456], [30, 0.4245285391807556], [8, 0.41784489154815674], [24, 0.3759050965309143], [4, 0.35314279794692993], [3, 0.3374638259410858], [18, 0.3227726221084595], [7, 0.3174118101596832], [9, 0.31610578298568726], [13, 0.3136803209781647], [17, 0.3031863570213318], [11, 0.2914002537727356], [26, 0.27425628900527954], [22, 0.2731577754020691], [5, 0.2610129117965698], [2, 0.237440824508667], [27, 0.21765515208244324], [6, 0.21382568776607513], [28, 0.19111473858356476], [10, 0.15157878398895264], [1, 0.11314333230257034], [16, -0.00727708637714386]]}, {"test case number": 112, "context": "Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks , concerning their gods and heroes , the nature of the world , and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices .

These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature .  The oldest known Greek literary sources , Homer 's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias .   Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology , with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes .   Sources   Greek mythology is known today primarily from Greek literature and representations on visual media dating from the Geometric period from c. 900\u2013800 BC onward . In fact , literary and archaeological sources integrate , sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict ; however , in many cases , the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots .   Literary sources   Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature . Nevertheless , the only general mythographical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity was the Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus . This work attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets and provides a grand summary of traditional Greek mythology and heroic legends . Apollodorus of Athens lived from c. 180\u2013125 BC and wrote on many of these topics . His writings may have formed the basis for the collection ; however the `` Library '' discusses events that occurred long after his death , hence the name Pseudo-Apollodorus .   Among the earliest literary sources are Homer 's two epic poems , the Iliad and the Odyssey . Other poets completed the `` epic cycle '' , but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely . Despite their traditional name , the `` Homeric Hymns '' have no direct connection with Homer . They are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so-called Lyric age . Hesiod , a possible contemporary with Homer , offers in his Theogony ( Origin of the Gods ) the fullest account of the earliest Greek myths , dealing with the creation of the world ; the origin of the gods , Titans , and Giants ; as well as elaborate genealogies , folktales , and etiological myths . Hesiod 's Works and Days , a didactic poem about farming life , also includes the myths of Prometheus , Pandora , and the Five Ages . The poet gives advice on the best way to succeed in a dangerous world , rendered", "modContext": "The ancient Greeks' myths and teachings, which encompass their gods/heroes as well as the nature of the world and the history and significance of their own cult and ritual practice, constitute Greek mythology.In ancient Greece, it was a component of the religion.The myths are cited and studied by contemporary scholars to gain insight into the religious and political structures of Ancient Greece and its society, as well as to comprehend the nature of myth creation.Vase-paintings and votive gifts are examples of Greek representational arts, which implicitly reflect Greek mythology through a large number of narratives.In the Greek myth, there are numerous deities, gods, goddesses and heroes, as well as heroic figures and creatures that recount their lives and adventures.These stories were initially disseminated through an oral tradition;Today, Greek literature is the primary source of knowledge about Greek myths.Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the oldest Greek literary sources, primarily focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath.The Theogony and the Works and Days, two poems by Homer's contemporary Hesiod, contain accounts of the world' genesis, divine rulers succession, human ages, the origin of human suffering, and religious sacrifice.Myths are present in various parts of the Bible, including Homeric Hymns, Epic Cycle fragments and lyric poems, Hellenistic Age scholars and poets like Plutarch and Pausanias.Archaeological finds are a primary source of information about Greek mythology, with gods and heroes being prominently featured in the decoration of many artifacts.The eighth century BC saw the emergence of geometric pottery that portrays scenes from the Trojan cycle and Heracles' exploits.Homeric and other mythological scenes are added to the literary evidence during the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic eras.The culture, arts, and literature of Western civilization have been greatly shaped by Greek mythology, which still holds significance in the language and heritage of this region.The themes have been inspired by Greek mythology and have gained contemporary significance and relevance among poets and artists, dating back to ancient times.Greek literature and visual media from the Geometric period from c. are the primary sources of the current knowledge about Greek mythology.From 900 to 800 BC.In reality, literary and archaeological sources merge, sometimes with mutual support and sometimes without reciprocity;The corpus of data being present is a strong indication that many aspects of Greek mythology have robust historical and factual foundations.Nearly all genres of Greek literature rely on Mythical narration in their literary texts.The Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus was the only surviving general mythical manual from Greek antiquity.The purpose of this work is to reconcile the conflicting narratives of the poets and offers a comprehensive summary of traditional Greek mythology and heroic tales.Apollodorus of Athens was present from c.Between 180-125 BC, he wrote extensively on various subjects.The collection may have been influenced by his writings;The  Library's content documents events that took place decades after his passing, giving rise to the name Pseudo-Apollodorus.The Iliad and the Odyssey,

can be generalised as :   * Cookery practised by indigenous people of Africa such as the Sotho- and Nguni-speaking people .  * Cookery that emerged from several waves of colonisation and immigration introduced during the colonial period by white European people of Dutch ( since 1652 ) , German , French , Italian , Greek and British ( since 1805~1820 ) descent and their Indo-Asian slaves or servants \u2013 this includes the cuisine of the so-called Cape Malay people , which has many characteristics of Indonesia and cooking styles from neighbouring colonial cultures such as Portuguese Mozambique .   Indigenous cookery   In the precolonial period , indigenous cuisine was characterised by the use of a very wide range of foods including fruits , nuts , bulbs , leaves and other products gathered from wild plants and by the hunting of wild game . The introduction of domestic cattle and grain crops by Bantu speakers who arrived in the southern regions from central Africa since 10,000 BC and the spread of cattle keeping to Khoisan groups enabled products and the availability of fresh meat on demand . The pre-colonial diet consisted primarily of cooked grains , especially sorghum , fermented milk ( somewhat like yogurt ) and roasted or stewed meat . At some point , maize replaced sorghum as the primary grain , and there is some dispute as to whether maize , a Central American crop , arrived with European settlers ( notably the Portuguese ) or spread through Africa before white settlement via Africans returning from the Americas during the era of the slave trade . People also kept sheep and goats , and communities often organised vast hunts for the abundant game ; but beef was considered the absolutely most important and high status meat . The ribs of any cattle that were slaughtered in many communities were so prized that they were offered to the chief of the village .   In many ways , the daily food of South African families can be traced to the indigenous foods that their ancestors ate . A typical meal in a South African family household that is Bantu-speaking is a stiff , fluffy porridge of maize meal ( called `` pap , '' and very similar to American grits ) with a flavourful stewed meat gravy . Traditional rural families ( and many urban ones ) often ferment their pap for a few days \u2013 especially if it is sorghum instead of maize \u2013 which gives it a tangy flavor . The Sotho-Tswana call this fermented pap , `` ting . ''   The vegetable is often some sort of pumpkin , varieties of which are indigenous to South Africa , although now many people eat pumpkins that originated in other countries . Rice and beans are also very popular even though they are not indigenous . Another common vegetable dish , which arrived in South Africa with its many Irish immigrants , but which has been adopted by South Africans , is shredded cabbage and white potatoes cooked with butter .   For many South Africans meat is the centre of any meal . The Khoisan ate roasted meat , and they also dried meat for later use . The influence of their diet is reflected in the common Southern African love of barbecue ( generally called in South Africa by its Afrikaans name , a `` braai '' ) and biltong ( dried preserved meat ) . As in the past , when men kept cattle as their prized possession in the rural areas , South Africans have a preference for beef . Today , South Africans enjoy not only beef , but mutton , goat , chicken and other meats as a centrepiece of a meal . On weekends , many South African families have a `` braai , '' and the meal usually consists of `` pap and vleis '' , which is maize meal and grilled meat . Eating meat even has a ritual significance in both traditional and modern South African culture . In Bantu culture , for weddings , initiations , the arrival of family members after a long trip and other special occasions , families will buy a live animal and slaughter it at home , and then prepare a large meal for the community or neighbourhood . Participants often say that spilling the blood of the animal on the ground pleases the ancestors who invisibly gather around the carcass . On holiday weekends , entrepreneurs will set up pens of live animals along the main roads of townships\u2014mostly sheep and goats\u2014for families to purchase , slaughter , cook and eat . Beef being the most", "modContext": "The cuisine of South Africa can be characterized by the cooking practices of indigenous communities in Africa, including those from the Sotho- and Nguni-speaking regions.During the colonial period, white European people of Dutch, German, French, Italian, Greek, and British descent introduced cooking techniques to the region through colonization and immigration. The Cape Malay people's cuisine, which has Indo-Asian characteristics and cooking styles from neighbouring colonist countries like Portuguese Mozambique, is a product of this process.Indigenous cooking during the precolonial period was characterized by the use of a diverse range of foods, including fruits, nuts and other wild plant products, as well as hunting game.Since 10,000 BC, the introduction of domestic cattle and grain crops to southern regions by Bantu speakers from central Africa and the dissemination of cattle keeping to Khoisan groups have facilitated the availability of fresh meat on demand.The pre-colonial era's eating pattern was primarily focused on cooked grains, particularly sorghum, fermented milk (similar to yogurt), and roasted or steweMaize was once the primary grain, replacing sorghum, and there is some disagreement about whether it was introduced by European colonizers (especially Portuguese) or spread through Africa before white people arrived via Africans returning from the Americas during the slave trade.People kept sheep and goats, and communities often arranged extensive hunts for game;Beef was regarded as the most crucial and highly esteemed meat.The chief of a village was given the prized ribs from any cattle that were slaughtered in many communities.Many South African families trace their daily meals back to the indigenous foods consumed by their ancestors.In Bantu-speaking South Africa, the common dish is a thick and fluffy maize meal mixed with stewed meat gravy.The use of fermented pap, especially in urban areas where it is often sorghum instead of maize, can result in a pungent taste.The Sotho-Tswana refer to this fermented pap as  ting.Pumpkins are a common vegetable in South Africa, but they are also grown in other countries.Although not native to the area, rice and beans are still widely consumed.South Africans have embraced a vegetable dish that originated with Irish immigrants, such as shredded cabbage and white potatoes cooked with butter.The heart of most meals in South Africa is often centered around meat.Roasted meat and dried meat were both consumed by the Khoisan for future consumption.The Southern African culture's love for barbecue and biltong is a reflection of their diet.Unlike in the past when cattle was the primary means of subsistence for men in rural areas, South Africans now have a preference for beef.In addition to beef, South Africans enjoy a variety of other meats as supplementary dishes.During the weekend, South African families often enjoy a  braai meal that includes grilled meat and maize meal, followed by pap and vleis.The consumption of meat is a part of both traditional and modern South African traditions, with ritualistic connotations.During special events like weddings, initiations and family gatherings in Bantu culture, families purchase live animals to slaughter at home and prepare a large meal for the community or nearby area.According to the participants, spilling animal blood on the ground makes the ancestors feel content as they gather around the carcass in an invisible manner.During holiday weekends, entrepreneurs will create sanctuaries for live animals, mostly sheep and goats, along townships' main roads, for families to purchase, slaughter, cook, and eat.", "question": "bunny chow, also known as kota, is a fast-food dish consisting of a hollowed-out loaf filled with curry and is native to which country?", "groundTruth": "south africans", "answer": "South Africa.", "modAnswer": "South Africa.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[2, 0.42657333612442017], [0, 0.3644666075706482], [20, 0.35507506132125854], [10, 0.35156893730163574], [4, 0.351420521736145], [17, 0.33922278881073], [23, 0.33594003319740295], [1, 0.3314923048019409], [16, 0.3267555832862854], [18, 0.32366323471069336], [15, 0.30269351601600647], [8, 0.2976655960083008], [14, 0.29456520080566406], [21, 0.2864755392074585], [9, 0.2737535238265991], [22, 0.27037549018859863], [13, 0.2667764723300934], [6, 0.2664082646369934], [3, 0.24338790774345398], [7, 0.22316314280033112], [25, 0.20863446593284607], [19, 0.1877025067806244], [11, 0.1536874622106552], [24, 0.1520863175392151], [12, 0.14552347362041473], [5, 0.08454378694295883]]}, {"test case number": 114, "context": "Anna Wintour , OBE ( ; born 3 November 1949 ) is a British journalist and editor .

He rose quickly up the ATP rankings , and by 1996 had reached the quarter-finals of the Wimbledon Championships . Throughout his career , Henman was a noted grass specialist , only becoming truly comfortable on clay and hard court before the end of his career , when in 2004 he reached the semi-finals in both the French and US Open . The year 2005 began a decline for Henman , and from that year onwards he never managed to pass through the third round in a Grand Slam tournament . Henman retired from professional tennis in late 2007 , but he remains active in the ATP Champions Tour ( a tour for former professional tennis players ) .   Early life   Henman was born in Oxford , Oxfordshire , as the youngest boy in a family of three boys . Henman 's father Tony , a solicitor , was accomplished at various sports , including tennis , hockey and squash . His mother Jane , a dress designer , played Junior Wimbledon and introduced Tim and his elder brothers Michael and Richard to tennis as soon as they could walk on the family 's grass tennis court . His great grandfather played at Wimbledon . His maternal grandfather , Henry Billington , played at Wimbledon between 1948 and 1951 , and he represented Britain in the Davis Cup in 1948 , 1950 and 1951 . In 1901 his maternal great-grandmother , Ellen Stanwell-Brown , was reputedly the first woman to serve overarm at Wimbledon . His maternal grandmother , Susan Billington , appeared regularly at Wimbledon in the 1950s , playing mixed doubles on Centre Court with her husband Henry , reaching the third round of the ladies ' doubles in 1951 , 1955 and 1956 .   Henman grew up in Weston-on-the-Green , Oxfordshire , a village between Oxford and Bicester with a population of around 500 . At home , the family owned a grass tennis court in their back garden . Henman began playing tennis before the age of three with a shortened squash racket . At this stage , he was already teaching himself how to serve and volley . At an early stage in his life , Henman decided if he did not succeed in tennis , he would become a golf player instead .   Henman attended the Longbridge School for boys between the ages of five and seven , and was enrolled in the private Dragon School in Oxford from seven to 11 . He excelled in all sports but was always best at tennis . But Henman was small for his age , a factor which would bode against him in the future . In 1985 , he was appointed the school 's captain of tennis and led the school 's tennis team to win 21 out of 27 matches . He remains to this day the only pupil who has won both the school 's junior and senior tennis tournaments in the same year . From the age of eight until his introduction to the Slater Squad , Henman received coaching from the David Lloyd Tennis Centre , where he was given personal lessons by former professional player Onny Parun from New Zealand . In retrospect , Parun stated that Henman 's greatest strength `` had always been his head .

also had 40 wins and 14 losses in the Great Britain Davis Cup team.From 1999 to 2005, he held the British number 1 ranking, and then Andy Murray took his place.He achieved a career high of being ranked as the World No.From July 2002 to October 2004, there were 4 instances.With a prize money of 11,635,542, he has become one of the most successful male British tennis players during the open era.At the age of three, Henman began playing tennis and started a systematic training regimen with the Slater Squad at eleven.Despite being sidelined by a serious injury for almost two years, his junior year saw him embark on international tours and experience some success.He rapidly advanced in the ATP rankings and eventually reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon Championships in 1996.Henman's career was marked by his expertise in grass, but he only gained confidence playing on clay and hard courts before retiring, including reaching the semi-finals of both the French and US Open in 2004.Henman's decline began in 2005, and he never advanced beyond the third round of a Grand Slam tournament.Henman ended his career in tennis at the end of 2007, but he still participates in events such as the ATP Champions Tour.Henman was born in Oxford, Oxfordshire, as the youngest of three boys in a family.Tony, Henman's father and a solicitor, had varying talents, such as tennis, hockey, and squash.Tim's mother, Jane, who was a dress designer, played at Junior Wimbledon and introduced him and his siblings, Michael and Richard, to the sport right away.At Wimbledon, his great grandfather was a player.Henry Billington, his maternal grandfather, was a Wimbledon player from 1948 to 1951 and represented Britain in the Davis Cup three times.It is believed that Ellen Stanwell-Brown, his maternal great-grandmother, was the first woman to serve overarm at Wimbledon in 1901.During the 1950s, Susan Billington, his maternal grandmother, played mixed doubles on Centre Court with her husband Henry and made it to the third round of the ladies' double event in 1951, 1955, and 1956.Weston-on the Green in Oxfordshire, a village with c. 500 inhabitants between Oxford and Bicester, was where Henman grew up.The family had a grass tennis court in the back garden of their home.Henman started playing tennis with a shorter squash racket before he reached the age of three.He had already started practicing serve and volley on his own.In his early years, Henman made up his mind to pursue golf if he didn't succeed in tennis.From ages seven to 11, Henman was enrolled in the Longbridge School for boys aged five to seven, as well as the private Dragon School in Oxford.He excelled in all sports, but his tennis prowess was unmatched.Henman's age was too young to have a significant impact on the next few years, which could be detrimental.In 1985, he was named the school's tennis team captain and led them to their most victories ever, winning 21 out of 27 matches.He is the only student to win both junior and senior tennis tournaments at the same time in the school's history.The David Lloyd Tennis Centre provided coaching from the age of eight to Henman, who was later introduced to the Slater Squad by former professional player Onny Parun from New Zealand.In hindsight, Parun claimed that Henman's most significant strength was his ability to see beyond the

It is one of the three branches of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic , together with the Army and the Air Force . Each ship of the Argentine Navy is designated with the prefix `` ARA '' before its name .   The Argentine Navy day is celebrated on May 17 , anniversary of the victory achieved in 1814 in the Battle of Montevideo over the Spanish fleet during the war of Independence .   History   19th century   The Argentine Navy was created in the aftermath of the May Revolution of May 25 , 1810 , which started the war for independence from Spain . The navy was first created to support Manuel Belgrano in the Paraguay campaign , but it was sunk by ships from Montevideo , and did not take part in that conflict . Renewed conflicts with Montevideo led to the creation of a second fleet , which participated in the capture of the city . As Buenos Aires had little maritime history , most men in the navy were from other nations , such as the Irish-born admiral William Brown , who directed the operation . As the cost of maintaining a navy was too high , most of the Argentine naval forces were composed of privateers .   Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata .   In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself . At the close of the century , the force included :   * 5 armoured cruisers  * 4 coastal defence ironclads  * 3 second-class , high-speed , British-built cruisers  * 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats  * 4 destroyers and  * 22 torpedo boats .   The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships : , , and , each at over 6,000 tons . Three older ironclads , , , and dated from the 1880s and early 1890s .   The navy 's ships were built primarily in Italy , Britain , France , and Spain and were operated by over 600 officers and 7760 seamen . These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery .   20th century   Argentina remained neutral in both world wars . In 1940 , Argentina 's navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world ( after the European powers , Japan , and the United States ) and the largest in Latin America . A ten-year building programme costing $ 60 million had produced a force of 14,500 sailors and over a thousand officers . The fleet included two First World War-era ( but modernized ) American-built s , three modern cruisers , a dozen British-built destroyers , and three submarines in addition to minelayers , minesweepers , coastal defence ships , and gunboats . A naval air force was also in operation .   In the postwar period , Naval Aviation and Marine Corps units were put under direct Navy command . With Brazil , Argentina is one of two South American countries to have operated two aircraft carriers : the and .   The Argentine Navy has been traditionally heavily involved in fishery inspection helping the Coast Guard : most notably in 1966 a destroyer fired on and holed a Soviet trawler that had refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata , in the 1970s there were four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships and continued in recent years .   The Navy also took part in all military coups through the 20th century . During the last dictatorship , Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War of the late 1970s in which thousands of people were kidnapped , tortured and killed by the forces of the Military Junta . The Naval Mechanics School , known as ESMA , was a notorious centre for torture .

In 1966, a destroyer fired at and holed dozens of Soviet trawlers that refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata; this was followed by four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships in the 1970s and several more in recent years.The Navy was involved in every military coup during the 20th century.Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War of the late 1970s during the last dictatorship, where the Military Junta kidnapped, tortured and killed thousands of people.The Naval Mechanics School, also known as ESMA, was a notorious location for torture.The Argentine Navy gave the school to human rights groups in October 2007, who were later identified as victims of the Swedish teenager Dagmar Hagelin and French nuns Alice Domon and L\u00e9onie Duquet.The Navy was the primary ally in finding a military solution to the country's two most significant disputes, the Beagle Conflict with Chile and the Falkland Islands () with the United Kingdom, during this regime.", "question": "what was the name of the argentine navy cruiser which was torpedoed and sunk during the 1982 falklands war?", "groundTruth": "manuel belgrano", "answer": "The Argentine navy cruiser torpedoed and sunk during the 1982 Falklands War was the ARA General Belgrano.", "modAnswer": "The Argentine navy cruiser torpedoed and sunk during the 1982 Falklands War was the ARA General Belgrano.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[23, 0.5606757998466492], [28, 0.5253700017929077], [8, 0.5190969109535217], [2, 0.4922083616256714], [19, 0.48623138666152954], [9, 0.46967244148254395], [11, 0.46835964918136597], [0, 0.43119919300079346], [20, 0.4267609119415283], [10, 0.4124666452407837], [1, 0.4017292261123657], [21, 0.39943253993988037], [5, 0.3932773172855377], [4, 0.38585683703422546], [14, 0.37649887800216675], [17, 0.36993446946144104], [15, 0.3583400547504425], [27, 0.34408998489379883], [3, 0.3437463641166687], [25, 0.338145911693573], [12, 0.3184487819671631], [7, 0.2989506721496582], [6, 0.28829246759414673], [22, 0.28793954849243164], [18, 0.27338141202926636], [24, 0.24918101727962494], [26, 0.24226723611354828], [16, 0.20904716849327087], [13, 0.0935528501868248]]}, {"test case number": 119, "context": "BBC Radio 1 is a British radio station operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation which also broadcasts internationally , specialising in modern and current popular music and chart hits throughout the day .

The very fact that it was part of an `` establishment '' institution such as the BBC was a turn-off for some , and needle time restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had . It also had limited finances ( partially because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station ) and often , as in January 1975 , suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks , strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives .   Despite this , it gained massive audiences , becoming the most listened to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows ( up to 20 million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows ) .

Some have a negative effect on a local ecosystem . Some introduced species may have no negative effect or only minor impact . Some species have been introduced intentionally to combat pests . They are called biocontrols and may be regarded as beneficial as an alternative to pesticides in agriculture for example . In some instances the potential for being beneficial or detrimental in the long run remains unknown . A list of some introduced species is given in a separate article .   The effects of introduced species on natural environments have gained much scrutiny from scientists , governments , farmers and others .

The term invasive refers only to those species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction . For practical purposes , this term is applied only to invasive species that cause damage .   In the broadest and most widely used sense , an introduced species is synonymous with non-native and therefore applies as well to most garden and farm organisms ; these adequately fit the basic definition given above . However , some sources add to that basic definition `` and are now reproducing in the wild , '' Carlton , James T. 2002 . Introduced Species in U.S. Coastal Waters . Pew Oceans Commission . which removes from consideration as introduced all of those species raised or grown in gardens or farms that do not survive without tending by people . With respect to plants , these latter are in this case defined as either ornamental or cultivated plants .   The following definition from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , although perhaps lacking ecological sophistication , is more typical : introduced species `` A species that has been intentionally or inadvertently brought into a region or area . Also called an exotic or non-native species . '' Introduction of a species outside its native range is all that is required to be qualified as an `` introduced species '' such that one can distinguish between introduced species that may not occur except in cultivation , under domestication or captivity whereas others become established outside their native range and reproduce without human assistance . Such species might be termed `` naturalized '' , `` established '' , `` wild non-native species '' . If they further spread beyond the place of introduction they are called `` invasive '' . The transition from introduction , to establishment and to invasion has been described in the context of plants . Introduced species are essentially `` non-native '' species . Invasive species are those introduced species that spreadwidely or quickly and cause harm , be that to the environment , human health , other valued resources or the economy . There have been calls from scientists to consider a species `` invasive '' only in terms of their spread and reproduction rather than the harm they may cause .   According to a practical definition , an invasive species is one that has been introduced and become a pest in its new location , spreading ( invading ) by natural means . The term is used to imply both a sense of urgency and actual or potential harm . For example , U.S. Executive Order 13112 ( 1999 ) defines `` invasive species '' as `` an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health '' . The biological definition of invasive species , on the other hand , makes no reference to the harm they may cause , only to the fact that they spread beyond the area of original introduction .   Although some argue that `` invasive '' is a loaded word and harm is difficult to define , the fact of the matter is that organisms have and continue to be introduced to areas in which they are not native , sometimes with but usually without much regard to the harm", "modContext": "An introduced species is a creature that has moved beyond its native range due to human activity, whether intentionally or unintentionally.The presence of non-indigenous species can have diverse consequences for the local ecosystem.Introduced species that have established themselves and spread beyond their original habitat are classified as invasive species.Certain substances have an adverse impact on a nearby ecosystem.There may be no significant impact or damage caused by the introduction of certain species.Several species have been deliberately introduced to combat pests.Biocontrols can serve as a beneficial substitute for pesticides in agriculture.The long-term benefits and drawbacks of each are uncertain in certain situations.A separate article provides a list of introduced species.Scientists, governments, and farmers have all given significant attention to the effects of introduced species on natural environments.The terminology of introduced species is in a state of flux due to various reasons.Introduced species can be categorized as either acclimatized, adventive, naturalized or immigrant, but they are only included in introduced categories when the species has established itself and been able to reproduce without human interference.The term invasive species is reserved for species that have developed and spread beyond their original habitat.In practical usage, this term is reserved for invasive species that cause harm.The most commonly used definition of an introduced species is the same as non-native, and it also applies to most garden and farm organisms.The basic definition mentioned earlier is well-suited for these.Some sources supplement the basic definition of  and are now living in the wild, as stated by Carlton and James T.The year is 2002.Introduced Species in the U.S.The coastal waters.The Pew Oceans Commission.All species that were raised or cultivated in gardens or farms and cannot be sustained without human supervision are no longer considered introduced.The latter are classified as either ornamental or cultivated plants in this case.Although not entirely ecologically sophisticated, the EPA's definition of introduced species is more typical. This term refers to any species that has been introduced into a region or area without proper planning.Also known as an exotic or non-indigenous species.Only the introduction of a species outside its native range can be classified as an  introduced species, which means that it may only occur in cultivation, domestication, or captivity, while others are established outside their native scope and reproduce without human intervention.Naturalized, established, and wild non-native species are all examples of naturalized species.If they extend beyond their original introduction, they are deemed invasive.In the realm of plants, the progression from introduction to establishment and invasion has been described.Essentially, introduced species are considered as non-native species.Introduced species that cause harm to the environment, human health, or other valuable resources are known as invasive species.Scientists have recommended that a species should be classified as invasive solely based on its spread and reproduction, rather than any potential harm.According to practical definitions, an invasive species is one that has been introduced and become a nuisance in its new habitat by spreading it through natural means.The term is employed to convey both a sense of urgency and actual or potential harm.As an illustration, U.S.The definition of invasive species in Executive Order 13112 ( 1999) is an alien species that may cause health or economic harm to humans.The biological definition of invasive species does not include the potential to cause harm, but rather highlights their geographic distribution.", "question": "which virus spread by fleas was deliberately introduced into australia to control rabbits in 1951?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "Myxoma virus.", "modAnswer": "The virus deliberately introduced into Australia to control rabbits in 1951 was Myxoma virus.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[5, 0.5528004765510559], [18, 0.39952221512794495], [10, 0.3699212968349457], [33, 0.34723666310310364], [31, 0.33976316452026367], [9, 0.3306449055671692], [37, 0.3152574300765991], [2, 0.3140454888343811], [32, 0.313906192779541], [8, 0.31239229440689087], [12, 0.29850631952285767], [16, 0.27426472306251526], [38, 0.2665497362613678], [28, 0.256955623626709], [4, 0.25637710094451904], [24, 0.2563020586967468], [3, 0.2559894919395447], [0, 0.2400018572807312], [14, 0.23824527859687805], [6, 0.2306748926639557], [13, 0.2275581657886505], [29, 0.20985716581344604], [1, 0.20680807530879974], [27, 0.19911374151706696], [22, 0.1952354609966278], [26, 0.1934514045715332], [25, 0.176548570394516], [30, 0.15604299306869507], [11, 0.14360785484313965], [36, 0.14334701001644135], [19, 0.14334701001644135], [17, 0.1392824500799179], [23, 0.07278679311275482], [21, 0.05251786485314369], [7, 0.0488758310675621], [34, 0.04701146110892296], [35, 0.04452192038297653], [20, -0.048199307173490524], [15, -0.0696490928530693]]}, {"test case number": 122, "context": "Figure 1 .

Early life   Although Smiley has no concrete biography beyond that offered briefly at the beginning of Call for the Dead , le Carr\u00e9 does leave clues in his novels .   Smiley was probably born around 1906 ( or 1915 on the revised chronology ) to middle class parents in the South of England , and attended a minor public school and an antiquated Oxford college of no real distinction ( in the 1982 BBC television adaptation of Smiley 's People , he refers to himself as a fellow of Lincoln College ) , studying modern languages with a particular focus on Baroque German literature . In July 1928 , while considering post-graduate study in that field , he was recruited into the Circus by his tutor Jebedee .   He underwent training and probation in Central Europe and South America , and spent the period from 1935 until approximately 1938 in Germany recruiting networks under cover as a lecturer . In 1939 , with the commencement of World War II , he saw active service not only in Germany , but also in Switzerland and Sweden . Smiley 's wartime superiors described him as having `` the cunning of Satan and the conscience of a virgin '' .

At the start of the novel , set around 1960 , Smiley has fallen from grace and is working in a relatively menial intelligence job , including security-clearing civil servants .

Over the course of the story , Smiley resigns from the Circus in anger on the spur of the moment while unravelling an East German spy ring , clearing his own name in so doing , and restoring his reputation while remaining in retirement at tale 's end , despite Maston 's pleadings .

From 1983 to 2007 , Blair was the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994 , following the sudden death of his predecessor , John Smith . Under Blair 's leadership , the party used the phrase `` New Labour '' , to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism . Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as `` social-ism '' , involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent , and advocated social justice , cohesion , equal worth of each citizen , and equal opportunity . Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism .   In May 1997 , the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory , the largest in its history , allowing Blair , at 43 years old , to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812 . In September 1997 , Blair attained early personal popularity , receiving a 93 % public approval rating , after his public response to the death of Diana , Princess of Wales . The Labour Party went on to win two more elections under his leadership : in 2001 , in which it won another landslide victory , and in 2005 , with a reduced majority . In the first years of the New Labour government , Blair 's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act , Human Rights Act , and Freedom of Information Act . Blair 's government also carried out the devolution , the establishing of the Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales , and the Northern Ireland Assembly , thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto . In Northern Ireland , Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement .   Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration , and ensured that British Armed Forces participated in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and , more controversially , the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Blair has faced strong criticism for his role in the invasion of Iraq , including calls for having him tried for war crimes and waging a war of aggression . In 2016 the Iraq Inquiry strongly criticised his actions and described the invasion of Iraq as unjustified and unnecessary .   Blair was succeeded as the leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007 , and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown .

His daughter Hazel Corskaddin was born there, where his wife, Sarah Margaret, gave birth to Blair's mother, Haz, above the family'S grocery store.The elder brother of Blair is Sir William Blair, who works as a High Court judge, while his sister is Sarah.Blair resided at the family's abode on Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh for the first 19 months of his life.During this time, his father was employed as a junior tax inspector while simultaneously studying law at the University of Edinburgh.During the 1950s, his family resided in Adelaide, South Australia, where his father was employed as a law lecturer at the University of Adelaide.In the suburb of Dulwich, the Blairs lived in close proximity to the university.", "question": "what is the title of tony blair's autobiography/memoir published in 2010, which covered events from 1994 to his resignation as prime minister?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "The title of Tony Blair's autobiography/memoir published in 2010, which covered events from 1994 to his resignation as Prime Minister, is \"A Journey: My Political Life.\"", "modAnswer": "The title of Tony Blair's autobiography/memoir published in 2010 is \"A Journey\".", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[0, 0.5106058716773987], [18, 0.4529484510421753], [23, 0.4447695016860962], [7, 0.43533045053482056], [8, 0.43162426352500916], [3, 0.42520272731781006], [15, 0.4208601117134094], [11, 0.4046492874622345], [17, 0.3993781805038452], [24, 0.3938581645488739], [20, 0.3861173987388611], [27, 0.37012186646461487], [12, 0.35596323013305664], [5, 0.3495181202888489], [19, 0.34639349579811096], [6, 0.33904212713241577], [10, 0.3265998959541321], [4, 0.32218968868255615], [13, 0.3135327100753784], [21, 0.29844266176223755], [22, 0.20879080891609192], [9, 0.20205247402191162], [16, 0.1968480944633484], [14, 0.18362747132778168], [2, 0.15138164162635803], [1, 0.14359107613563538], [25, 0.13701415061950684], [26, 0.0812683179974556]]}, {"test case number": 125, "context": "The Nobel Prize ( , ; Swedish definite form , singular : Nobelpriset ; ) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian committees in recognition of academic , cultural and/or scientific advances .

Printed examples emerged in 19th-century Germany and in 18th-century England , where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced . William Hogarth 's 18th century English cartoons include both narrative sequences , such as A Rake 's Progress , and single panels .

The capital and largest city is Tbilisi . Georgia covers a territory of 69700 km\u00b2 , and its 2015 population is about 3.75 million . Georgia is a unitary , semi-presidential republic , with the government elected through a representative democracy .   During the classical era , several independent kingdoms became established in what is now Georgia . The kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia adopted Christianity in the early 4th century . A unified Kingdom of Georgia reached the peak of its political and economic strength during the reign of King David IV and Queen Tamar in the 11th\u201312th centuries . Thereafter the area was dominated by various large empires for centuries , including the Mongols , the Ottoman Empire , and successive dynasties of Iran . In the late 18th century , the kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti forged an alliance with the Russian Empire , and the area was annexed by Russia in 1801 . The latter 's rule over Georgia was confirmed in 1813 through the Treaty of Gulistan with Qajar Iran . Following the Russian Revolution in 1917 , Georgia obtained independence , though only briefly , and established its first-ever republic under German and British protection , only to be invaded by Soviet Russia in 1921 and subsequently absorbed into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic .   After restoring its independence once again in 1991 , post-communist Georgia suffered from civil and economic crisis for most of the 1990s . This lasted until the peaceful Rose Revolution , when Georgia pursued a strongly pro-Western foreign policy , introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at NATO and European integration . The country 's Western orientation soon led to the worsening of relations with Russia , culminating in the brief Russo-Georgian War .   Georgia is a member of the Council of Europe and the GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development . It contains two de facto independent regions , Abkhazia and South Ossetia , which gained limited international recognition after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War . Georgia and a major part of the international community consider the regions to be part of Georgia 's sovereign territory under Russian military occupation .   Etymology   `` Georgia '' probably stems from the Persian designation of the Georgians \u2013 gur\u011f\u0101n , in the 11th and 12th centuries adapted via Syriac gurz-\u0101n/gurz-iy\u0101n and Arabic \u0135ur\u0135an/\u0135urzan . Lore based theories were given by he traveller Jacques de Vitry , who explained the name 's origin by the popularity of St. George amongst Georgians , while traveller Jean Chardin thought that `` Georgia '' came from Greek \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 ( `` tiller of the land '' ) . As Prof. Alexander Mikaberidze adds , these century-old explanations for the word Georgia/Georgians are rejected by the scholarly community , who point to the Persian word gur\u011f/gur\u011f\u0101n ( `` wolf '' ) as the root of the word . Starting with the Persian word gur\u011f/gur\u011f\u0101n , the word was later adopted in numerous other languages , including Slavic and West European languages . This term itself might have been established through the ancient Iranian appellation of the near-Caspian region , which was referred to as Gorgan ( `` land of the wolves '' ) .   The native name is Sakartvelo ( \u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd ; `` land of Kartvelians '' ) , derived from the core central Georgian region of Kartli , recorded from the 9th century , and in extended usage referring to the entire medieval Kingdom of Georgia by the 13th century . The self-designation used by ethnic Georgians is Kartvelebi ( \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8 , i.e . `` Kartvelians '' )   The medieval Georgian Chronicles present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians , Kartlos , a great-grandson of Japheth . However , scholars agree that the word is derived from the Karts , the latter being one of the proto-Georgian tribes that emerged as a dominant group in ancient times . The name Sakartvelo ( \u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd ) consists of two parts . Its root , kartvel-i ( \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da-\u10d8 ) , specifies an inhabitant of the core central-eastern Georgian region of Kartli , or Iberia as it is known in sources of the Eastern Roman Empire .

However, it was later invaded by Soviet Russia in 1921 and subsequently absorbed into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic.After regaining independence in 1991, Georgia experienced civil and economic turmoil for most of the 1990s.Georgia maintained its strong pro-Western foreign policy and implemented a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at NATO and European integration during the peaceful Rose Revolution, which marked the end of this period.The country's Western orientation caused the relationship with Russia to deteriorate, leading to the short-lived Russo-Georgian War.The Council of Europe and the GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development have Georgia as one of their membership.Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which gained little international recognition after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, are included in it as de facto independent regions.The areas are considered part of Georgia's sovereign territory by Georgia and a significant portion of the global community, while being held by the Russian military.It is likely that Georgia's etymology is linked to the Persian term gurn, which was later adopted by Syriac fusions like al-Ghazia and Gaddafi in the 11th and 12th centuries.Jacques de Vitry, a traveller, presented theories on the origin of the name due to the popularity of St.According to George, the Georgians believed that  Georgia's roots were in Greek and related to the tiller of the land.In the role of Prof.Alexander Mikaberidze points out that the scholarly community rejects centuries-old explanations for Georgia/Georgians, instead citing the Persian word gur/guryn ( wolf'') as the origin of the term.It was first used as a prefix in the Persian language, and it later became common in various other languages, including Slavic and West European languages.The term could have been derived from the ancient Iranian designation for the near-Caspian region, which was known as Gorgan ( land of the wolves''). is the name given to Sakartvelo (;The term \" land of Kartvelians\" was coined from the core central Georgian region of Karatli, which was recorded in the 9th century, and by the 13th centuries, it referred to the entire medieval Kingdom of Georgia.Kartvelebi ( , i.) is the self-identified title used by ethnic Georgians.e.According to the medieval Georgian Chronicles, Kartlos, the great-grandson of Japheth, is the eponymous for \"Kartvelians.\"The word's origin is believed by scholars to be linked to the Karts, who were among the proto-Georgian tribes that emerged as a dominant group in ancient Greece.Sakartvelo () is a name that has two components.The root kartvel-i (-) denotes an individual who dwells in the central-eastern region of Georgia, specifically Kartli or Iberia as recorded in Eastern Roman Empire sources.The Ancient Greeks, including Strabo, Herodotus, Plutarch, Homer, and others.", "question": "perhaps foreshadowing recent events in ukraine, over what region of the southern caucasus did russia and georgia go to war in 2008?", "groundTruth": "south ossetia", "answer": "Russia and Georgia went to war over the region of South Ossetia in the southern Caucasus in 2008.", "modAnswer": "Russia and Georgia went to war over the region of South Ossetia in the Southern Caucasus in 2008.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[17, 0.6561561822891235], [20, 0.5890113711357117], [14, 0.5163410305976868], [3, 0.49560362100601196], [19, 0.4908928871154785], [16, 0.4419229328632355], [21, 0.43773171305656433], [0, 0.4255378842353821], [23, 0.4251440465450287], [8, 0.4079521894454956], [27, 0.4062895178794861], [13, 0.4027993083000183], [25, 0.4018539786338806], [15, 0.36843156814575195], [2, 0.3518299460411072], [29, 0.3453218936920166], [10, 0.3343919515609741], [11, 0.32558169960975647], [4, 0.30608639121055603], [12, 0.29806604981422424], [18, 0.27418726682662964], [26, 0.2602704167366028], [5, 0.24561524391174316], [7, 0.2439103126525879], [36, 0.2346716821193695], [30, 0.1893717348575592], [33, 0.18557238578796387], [9, 0.1713143289089203], [32, 0.11865532398223877], [22, 0.10535649955272675], [35, 0.10263218730688095], [1, 0.06318864226341248], [34, 0.06305897980928421], [28, 0.0356445237994194], [31, 0.01109028048813343], [6, -0.002749243751168251], [24, -0.03498290479183197]]}, {"test case number": 128, "context": "Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order Hymenoptera .

Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals . Larger colonies consist mostly of sterile , wingless females forming castes of `` workers '' , `` soldiers '' , or other specialised groups . Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called `` drones '' and one or more fertile females called `` queens '' . The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity , collectively working together to support the colony .   Ants have colonised almost every landmass on Earth . The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands . Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15\u201325 % of the terrestrial animal biomass . Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats , tap resources , and defend themselves . Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic , commensal , parasitic , and mutualistic relationships.H\u00f6lldobler & Wilson ( 1990 ) , p. 471   Ant societies have division of labour , communication between individuals , and an ability to solve complex problems . These parallels with human societies have long been an inspiration and subject of study . Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine , medication , and rituals . Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents . Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans , however , as they can damage crops and invade buildings . Some species , such as the red imported fire ant ( Solenopsis invicta ) , are regarded as invasive species , establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally .   Etymology   The word `` ant '' is derived from ' , ' of Middle English which are derived from ' of Old English , and is related to the dialectal Dutch ' and the Old High German ' , hence the modern German ' . All of these words come from West Germanic * , and the original meaning of the word was `` the biter '' ( from Proto-Germanic * , `` off , away '' + * `` cut '' ) .

Older ants in the genus Sphecomyrmodes have been found in 99 million year-old amber from Myanmar . After the rise of flowering plants about 100 million years ago they diversified and assumed ecological dominance around 60 million years ago .

The Romans had great models to base their works upon , such as Herodotus ( c. 484 \u2013 425 BCE ) and Thucydides ( c. 460 \u2013 c. 395 BCE ) . Roman historiographical forms are different from the Greek ones however , and voice very Roman concerns . Unlike the Greeks , Roman historiography did not start out with an oral historical tradition . The Roman style of history was based on the way that the Annals of the Pontifex Maximus , or the Annales Maximi , were recorded . The Annales Maximi include a wide array of information , including religious documents , names of consuls , deaths of priests , and various disasters throughout history . Also part of the Annales Maximi are the White Tablets , or the \u201c Tabulae Albatae , \u201d which consist of information on the origin of the republic .   History of Roman historiography   The foundation of Roman historiography   The most well-known originator of Roman historiography was Quintus Fabius Pictor , also known as the \u201c Founder of Historiography \u201d . Before the second Punic war , there was no historiography in Rome , but after , it was needed to commemorate this important occasion . Q. Fabius Pictor took up the task and wrote a history of Rome in Greek , not Latin . This choice of writing about the war in Greek arose from a need to address the Greeks and counter another author , Timaeus , who also wrote a history of Rome until the Second Punic War . Timaeus wrote with a negative view of Rome . Therefore , in defense of the Roman state , Q. Fabius Pictor wrote in Greek , using Olympiad dating and a Hellenistic style . Q. Fabius Pictor \u2019 s style of writing history defending the Roman state and its actions , and using propaganda heavily , eventually became a defining characteristic of Roman historiography .   Q. Fabius Pictor is known for the establishment of the \u201c ab urbe condita \u201d tradition of historiography which is writing history \u201c from the founding of the city. \u201d After Q. Fabius Pictor wrote , many other authors followed his lead , inspired by the new literary form : Lucius Cincius Alimentus , Gaius Acilius , Aulus Postumius Albinus , and Cato the Elder . Cato the Elder is credited as the first historian to write in Latin . His work , the Origines , was written to teach Romans what it means to be Roman . Like Q. Fabius Pictor , Cato the Elder wrote ab urbe condita , and the early history is filled with legends illustrating Roman virtues . The Origines also spoke of how not only Rome , but the other Italian towns were venerable , and that the Romans were indeed superior to the Greeks .   The Romans enjoyed serious endeavors and so the writing of historiography became very popular for upper class citizens who wanted to spend their time on worthwhile , virtuous , \u201c Roman \u201d activities . As leisure time was looked down upon by the Romans , writing history became an acceptable way to spend retirement .   Almost as soon as historiography started being used by the Romans , it split into two traditions : the annalistic tradition and the monographic tradition .   The annalistic tradition   The authors who used the Annalistic tradition wrote histories year-by-year , from the beginning , which was most frequently from the founding of the city , usually up until the time that they were living in .   Some annalistic authors :  * Gnaeus Gellius ( c. 140 BC ) wrote his history from Aeneas until 146 BC .  * Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi ( c. 133 BC ) wrote trying to figure out why the Roman society had begun to decline . His history chronicled Rome from the foundation until 154 BC , when he believed that the society had hit its lowest point .  * Publius Mucius Scaevola ( c. 133 BC ) wrote a history from the foundation of the city in 80 books .  * Sempronius Asellio ( c. 100 BC ) wrote a history from the Punic Wars until c. 100 BC .  * Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius wrote that all Roman wars are just , and that the Senate and all Roman dealings were honorable , in annalistic form .   The monographic tradition   Monographs are more similar to the history books that we are used to today ; they are usually on a single topic ,", "modContext": "The Greeks are responsible for the development of Roman historiography, as they invented the form.Herodotus (c.) was among the Romans who had a great model for their works.Between 484 and 425 BCE, Thucydides ( c.From 460 to circa.The year 395 BCE is commonly referred to.Despite their differences, Roman historiographical forms are distinct from Greek ones and express highly Roman concerns.Unlike the Greeks, Roman historiography did not begin with an oral history.The Annals of the Pontifex Maximus and their accompanying texts were a foundation for the Roman style of history.In the Annales Maximi, there is a vast assortment of information on historical events, including religious texts, the names of consuls, priest deaths, and disasters.The Annales Maximi feature the White Tablets, also known as the \" Tabulae Albatada\" and their contents that contain information about the republic's beginnings.Quintus Fabius Pictor, who is commonly recognized as the \" Founder of Historiography,\" was responsible for the establishment of Roman historiographic history.Rome had no historiography before the second Punic war, but it was necessary afterward to honor this momentous occasion.Q.The task was undertaken by Fabius Pictor, who wrote a history of Rome in Greek rather than Latin.Writing about the war in Greek was a response to the need to address the Greeks and counter Timaeus' historical contributions to Rome until the Second Punic War.Rome was the subject of Timaeus' disapproval in his writing.In defense of the Roman state, Q.Fabius Pictor utilized the Olympiad dating and a Hellenistic approach when writing in Greek.Q.Fabius Pictor's approach to writing history, which involved advocating for the Roman state and its actions while also using propaganda, became a defining characteristic of Roman historiography.Q.The \"ab urbe condita\" tradition of historiography, which involves writing history from the moment he was born, is attributed to Fabius Pictor.Following Q.Lucius Cincius Alimentus, Gaius Acilius and Aulus PostumiUS Albinus were among the authors who followed in the footsteps of Fabiuse Pictor's writing, inspired by the new literary style.The first historian to use Latin in writing was Cato the Elder.He wrote the Origines to teach Romans about their identity and status.Similar to Q.Roman virtues are depicted in legends from the early history, while Fabius Pictor and Cato the Elder wrote ab urbe condita.The Origines noted that Rome and other Italian towns were not only venerable, but that the Romans were superior to the Greeks.Historiography gained popularity among upper class individuals who were interested in engaging in virtuous and noble activities during their Roman occupation.The Romans' disapproval of leisure time led to the acceptance of writing history as a means of spending their retirement.As soon as historiography was introduced to Rome, it divided into two traditions: the annalistic and monographic traditions.Annalistic tradition: Authors wrote annual histories from the beginning of the city to the present day (usually before the end of one's life),Annalistic literature includes works by Gnaeus Gellius (c.).From Aeneas to 146 BC, he wrote his entire history.c. Lucius Calpurnius and Piso Frugi, respectively.In 133 BC, he wrote about the reasons behind the decline of Roman society.The period between its foundation and 154 BC marked the beginning of his chronicle on Rome, during which he believed the society had reached its lowest point.Publius Mucius Scaevola ( around c.In 133 BC, a history of the city was written in 80 books.Sempronius Asellio ( c.A history from the Punic Wars to later times was written by him in 100 BC.In 100 BC,Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius argued that Roman wars are fair, and that all dealings with Rome and the Senate were honorable.The monographic approach is reminiscent of the history books we read today.", "question": "which roman historian was the son-in-law of agricola the roman governor of britain?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "The Roman historian who was the son-in-law of Agricola, the Roman governor of Britain, is Tacitus.", "modAnswer": "Tacitus", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[19, 0.5063550472259521], [10, 0.49526146054267883], [13, 0.4503888487815857], [14, 0.44682344794273376], [25, 0.44622790813446045], [35, 0.4286365807056427], [0, 0.4169541895389557], [24, 0.40944790840148926], [27, 0.40389442443847656], [16, 0.40019792318344116], [5, 0.39963310956954956], [38, 0.39629220962524414], [33, 0.3879649043083191], [17, 0.3748411536216736], [21, 0.3742135763168335], [29, 0.3725755214691162], [28, 0.37120598554611206], [41, 0.36681514978408813], [23, 0.3666134476661682], [6, 0.3620140254497528], [15, 0.3587799668312073], [11, 0.35372769832611084], [1, 0.3515740633010864], [40, 0.3434852063655853], [7, 0.3246344327926636], [36, 0.3210517168045044], [43, 0.3145040273666382], [39, 0.2985067665576935], [31, 0.2943967580795288], [37, 0.28770408034324646], [34, 0.28152552247047424], [4, 0.27979952096939087], [30, 0.2786591649055481], [8, 0.277490496635437], [44, 0.2690661549568176], [2, 0.2546614706516266], [9, 0.18718287348747253], [42, 0.17227229475975037], [32, 0.15823400020599365], [3, 0.1525416076183319], [20, 0.09819808602333069], [18, 0.09819808602333069], [12, 0.09819808602333069], [22, 0.03560282289981842], [26, -0.012180611491203308]]}, {"test case number": 131, "context": "Lolita is a novel by Vladimir Nabokov , written in English and published in 1955 in Paris , in 1958 in New York City , and in 1959 in London .
