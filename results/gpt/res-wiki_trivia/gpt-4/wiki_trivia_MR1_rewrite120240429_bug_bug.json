[{"test case number": 26, "context": "Natural history is the research and study of organisms including animals , fungi and plants in their environment , leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study . It encompasses scientific research but is not limited to it , with articles nowadays more often published in science magazines than in academic journals . Grouped among the natural sciences , natural history is the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms . That is a very broad designation in a world filled with many narrowly focused disciplines . So while natural history dates historically from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the mediaeval Arabic world , through to European Renaissance naturalists working in near isolation , today 's field is more of a cross discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences . For example , geobiology has a strong multi-disciplinary nature combining scientists and scientific knowledge of many specialty sciences .   A person who studies natural history is known as a naturalist or natural historian .   Definitions   Pre-twentieth-century   The English term `` natural history '' is a translation of the Latin historia naturalis . Its meaning has narrowed progressively with time , while the meaning of the related term `` nature '' has widened ( see also History below ) . In antiquity , it covered essentially anything connected with nature or which used materials drawn from nature . For example , Pliny the Elder 's encyclopedia of this title , published circa 77 to 79 AD , covers astronomy , geography , man and his technology , medicine and superstition as well as animals and plants .   Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions : the humanities ( primarily what is now known as classics ) and divinity , with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment . The study of nature revived in the Renaissance , and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge , itself divided into descriptive natural history and natural philosophy , the analytical study of nature . In modern terms , natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern physics and chemistry , while natural history included the biological and geological sciences . The two were strongly associated . During the heyday of the gentleman scientists , many people contributed to both fields , and early papers in both were commonly read at professional science society meetings such as the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences \u2013 both founded during the seventeenth century .   Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives , such as Linnaeus ' aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden . Similarly , the Industrial Revolution prompted the development of geology to help find useful mineral deposits .   The astronomer , William Herschel was also a natural historian . Instead of working with plants or minerals he worked with the stars . He spent his time building telescopes to see the stars and the rest of the time watching the stars . In the beginning , he believed there to be an object known as a nebulae , but then later realized it was just another stage in star development . Herschel can be considered a natural historian because he observed the natural world and attempted to understand it . In the process he made charts of all the stars and kept records of all that he saw ( while his sister Caroline did all the documenting ) .   Post-nineteenth-century   Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources , and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field , creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them . For example , while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study , it can also be defined as a body of knowledge , and as a craft or a practice , in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed .   Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment , as seen in this definition by Marston Bates : `` Natural history is the study of animals and Plants \u2013 of organisms . ... I like to think , then , of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual \u2013 of what plants and animals do , how they react to each other and their environment , how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities '' and this more recent definition by D.S . Wilcove and T.", "modContext": "Natural history is the examination and analysis of living organisms, such as animals, fungi, and plants, in their surroundings, with a focus on observation rather than experimental research.While scientific research is a part of it, it is not the only one, as science magazines are now more commonly used than academic journals to publish articles.The systematic study of natural phenomena and their organisms is known as natural history, which is a subset of the natural sciences.In a world filled with narrowly defined fields of study, the term is quite broad.Although natural history has its roots in ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Arabic cultures, it currently exists as a multidisciplinary field of study that blends various specialty fields.The multi-disciplinary approach of geobiology involves scientists who combine their knowledge of various fields of science.Naturalist or natural historian is the term used to describe someone who studies natural history.The English term natural history predates the 20th century and is derived from the Latin historia naturalis.Throughout time, the significance of this concept has gradually diminished while the interpretation of the related term \"nature\" has expanded (see History below).In ancient times, it referred to anything that was connected to nature or used natural resources.Pliny the Elder's encyclopedia, which was published between 77 and 79 AD, contains information on astronomy, geography, technology, medicine, superstition, animals, and plants.During the medieval period, European scholars categorized knowledge into two main categories: the humanities (now known as classics) and divinity, with science being conducted primarily through textual research rather than observation or experimentation.The study of nature was revived during the Renaissance and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge, which divided descriptive natural history and natural philosophy.In contemporary language, natural philosophy was analogous to modern physics and chemistry, while natural history encompassed the biological and geological sciences.The two were closely linked.The period of the gentleman scientist era was marked by numerous individuals contributing to both fields, and early papers in both were commonly read at professional science society meetings, such as the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences \u2013 both established in the seventeenth century.Linnaeus' desire to improve the economic situation of Sweden was one of the practical reasons that motivated the encouragement of natural history.The Industrial Revolution prompted the development of geology to identify valuable mineral deposits.William Herschel, an astronomer, was also a natural historian.He opted to work with the stars instead of using plants or minerals.His attention was directed towards building telescopes for stargazing and observing the stars.Initially, he thought of a nebulae as an object, but eventually came to the realization that it was just another phase in the development of stars.Herschel's natural history is attributed to his observation of the natural world and his endeavor to grasp its meaning.He created charts of all the stars and kept records of everything he saw, while his sister Caroline was responsible for documenting it.The definition of natural history in the post-nineteenth century has been influenced by various fields and sources, with modern definitions often emphasizing a specific aspect of the field.Although natural history is commonly associated with observation and study, it can also be seen as a body of knowledge and practice that places more importance on the observer than on what they observe.The scientific study of individual organisms in their surroundings is often the focus of definitions from biologists, as Marston Bates' definition suggests.The.The.The.The study of life at the individual

Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5 % by mass , although this can vary in more landlocked waters , near the mouths of large rivers , or at great depths . About 85 % of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride . Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature . Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides , the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun . The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth ( the Coriolis effect ) .   Former changes in the sea levels have left continental shelves , shallow areas in the sea close to land .
