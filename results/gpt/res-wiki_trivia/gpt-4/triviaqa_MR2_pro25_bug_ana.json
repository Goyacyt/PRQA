Although his televisual time on the series was comparatively brief and turbulent , Baker has continued as the Sixth Doctor in Big Finish 's range of original Doctor Who audio adventures . Within the series ' narrative , the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS , frequently with companions . When the Doctor is critically injured , he can regenerate his body ; in doing so , his physical appearance and personality change . Baker portrays the sixth such incarnation , a flamboyant man in brightly coloured , mismatched clothes whose brash and overbearing personality set him apart from all his previous incarnations .   The Sixth Doctor appeared in three seasons . His appearance in the first of these was at the end of the final episode of The Caves of Androzani which featured the regeneration from the Fifth Doctor and thereafter in the following serial The Twin Dilemma , the end of that season . The Sixth Doctor 's era was marked by the decision of the BBC controller Michael Grade to put the series on an 18-month `` hiatus '' between seasons 22 and 23 , with only one new Doctor Who story , Slipback , made on radio during the hiatus , broadcast as 6 parts ( at 10 minutes each ) on BBC Radio 4 from 25 July to 8 August 1985 , as part of a children 's magazine show called Pirate Radio Four . Colin Baker had been signed up for four years , as the previous actor Peter Davison had left after only three years .   Prior to its postponement , season 23 was well advanced with episodes already drafted and in at least one case distributed to cast and production . Alongside `` The Nightmare Fair '' , The Ultimate Evil '' , `` Mission to Magnus '' , `` Yellow Fever and How to Cure It '' , the remaining stories were still under development in a 25-minute episode format after the season was postponed . These were all dropped with the reconception of the season in mid 1985 in favour of a 14 episode story arc called The Trial of a Time Lord . The Sixth Doctor also appeared in the special Dimensions in Time . There are also novels and audio plays featuring the Sixth Doctor , and the character has been visually referenced several times in the revived 2000s production of the show .   Biography   The sixth Doctor 's regeneration was initially unstable , and he nearly strangled Peri before he came to his senses . Realising what he had nearly done , he initially considered going into a hermitlike existence on the planet Titan 3 , only to be caught up in events on the planet Jocanda , after which he resumed his travels ( The Twin Dilemma ) . He encountered many old foes including the Master , Daleks , Cybermen and Sontarans , and even shared an adventure with his own second incarnation in The Two Doctors . He also faced a renegade female Time Lord scientist , the Rani , who was conducting experiments on humans using the Luddite riots as a cover .   Later , the Doctor and Peri landed on the devastated planet Ravolox , which they discovered was actually Earth , moved across space with devastating consequences . Before they could discover the reason for this disaster , the TARDIS landed on Thoros Beta . What actually happened here is unclear , but initial accounts suggest that Peri was killed after being cruelly used as a test subject in brain transplant experiments and the Doctor was pulled out of time to a Time Lord space station where he was put on trial for the second time by his own race , the Time Lords . In reality the trial was a cover-up organised by the High Council . A race from Andromeda had stolen Time Lord secrets and hidden on Earth , so to protect themselves the Time Lords had moved Earth through space , burning the surface in a massive fireball and leaving it as Ravolox . The prosecutor at that trial , the Valeyard , turned out to be a possible future , an evil incarnation of the Doctor himself who was out to steal his remaining lives . He had also edited the Matrix recordings of the Doctor 's travels ; in reality Peri had survived events on Thoros Beta .

With members John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era . Rooted in skiffle , beat , and 1950s rock and roll , the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles , ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock , often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways . In the early 1960s , their enormous popularity first emerged as `` Beatlemania '' , but as the group 's music grew in sophistication , led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s .   The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960 , with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player . The core of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers , most notably Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act , and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit , `` Love Me Do '' , in late 1962 . They acquired the nickname `` the Fab Four '' as Beatlemania grew in Britain the next year , and by early 1964 became international stars , leading the `` British Invasion '' of the United States pop market . From 1965 onwards , the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the widely influential albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) , Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( 1967 ) , The Beatles ( commonly known as the White Album , 1968 ) and Abbey Road ( 1969 ) .   After their break-up in 1970 , they each enjoyed successful musical careers of varying lengths . McCartney and Starr , the surviving members , remain musically active . Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980 , and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001 .   According to the RIAA , the Beatles are the best-selling music artists in the United States , with 178 million certified units . They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act . In 2008 , the group topped Billboard magazine 's list of the all-time most successful `` Hot 100 '' artists ; , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty . They have received ten Grammy Awards , an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards . Collectively included in Time magazine 's compilation of the twentieth century 's 100 most influential people , they are the best-selling band in history , with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide . The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 , and all four were inducted individually from 1994 to 2015 .   History   1957–62 : Formation , Hamburg , and UK popularity   In March 1957 , John Lennon , then aged sixteen , formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank school . They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks , before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name . Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July . In February 1958 , McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band . The fourteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon , impressing him with his playing , but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young to join them . After a month of Harrison 's persistence , they enlisted him as their lead guitarist . By January 1959 , Lennon 's Quarry Bank friends had left the group , and he began studies at the Liverpool College of Art . The three guitarists , billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs , were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer . Lennon 's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe , who had recently sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar , joined in January 1960 , and it was he who suggested changing the band 's name to Beatals , as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets . They used the name"], [2, "An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron ( proton or hydrogen ion H+ ) , or , alternatively , capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair ( a Lewis acid ) .   The first category of acids is the proton donors or Brønsted acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ .   Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in acid ' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic .   Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . As these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial sense ) can be solutions or pure substances , and can be derived from acids ( in the strict sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid .   The second category of acids are Lewis acids , which form a covalent bond with an electron pair . An example is boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( NH3 ) . Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( H+ ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs . However , hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other Brønsted-Lowry acids can not form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids . Conversely , many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry acids . In modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid .   Definitions and concepts   Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids .   Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions , or can be dissolved in water , so the Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant .   The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton ( H+ ) from an acid to a base .   Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions . Interestingly , although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids , they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms .   Arrhenius acids   The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions ( H+ ) or protons in 1884 . An Arrhenius acid is a substance that , when added to water , increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water . Note that chemists often write H+ ( aq ) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus , a proton , does not exist alone in water , it exists as the hydronium ion , H3O+ . Thus , an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium"], [3, "The Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama was first awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association as a separate category in 1951 .

Transportation is not the only purpose of cruising , particularly on cruises that return passengers to their originating port , with the ports of call usually in a specified region of a continent . There are even `` cruises to nowhere '' or `` nowhere voyages '' where the ship makes 2–3 night round trips without any ports of call .   By contrast , dedicated transport oriented ocean liners do `` line voyages '' and typically transport passengers from one point to another , rather than on round trips . Traditionally , an ocean liner for the transoceanic trade will be built to a higher standard than a typical cruise ship , including high freeboard and stronger plating to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean , such as the North Atlantic . Ocean liners also usually have larger capacities for fuel , food , and other stores for consumption on long voyages , compared to dedicated cruise ships .   Although often luxurious , ocean liners had characteristics that made them unsuitable for cruising , such as high fuel consumption , deep draught that prevented their entering shallow ports , enclosed weatherproof decks that were not appropriate for tropical weather , and cabins designed to maximize passenger numbers rather than comfort ( such as a high proportion of windowless suites ) . The gradual evolution of passenger ship design from ocean liners to cruise ships has seen passenger cabins shifted from inside the hull to the superstructure with private verandas . The modern cruise ships , while sacrificing qualities of seaworthiness , have added amenities to cater to water tourists , and recent vessels have been described as `` balcony-laden floating condominiums '' .   The distinction between ocean liners and cruise ships has blurred , particularly with respect to deployment . Differences in construction remain . Larger cruise ships have also engaged in longer trips such as transoceanic voyages which may not return to the same port for months ( longer round trips ) . Some former ocean liners operate as cruise ships , such as Marco Polo . This number is diminishing . The only dedicated transatlantic ocean liner in operation as a liner ( as of December 2013 ) is Queen Mary 2 of the Cunard fleet . She also has the amenities of contemporary cruise ships and sees significant service on cruises .   Cruising has become a major part of the tourism industry , accounting for U.S. $ 29.4 billion with over 19 million passengers carried worldwide in 2011 . The industry 's rapid growth has seen nine or more newly built ships catering to a North American clientele added every year since 2001 , as well as others servicing European clientele . Smaller markets , such as the Asia-Pacific region , are generally serviced by older ships . These are displaced by new ships in the high growth areas .   The world 's largest cruise ship is currently Royal Caribbean International 's Harmony of the Seas beating her sister ships ( Allure of the Seas and Oasis of the Seas ) by about 2.15 meters .   History   Origins   The birth of leisure cruising began with the formation of the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company in 1822 . The company started out as a shipping line with routes between England and the Iberian Peninsula , adopting the name Peninsular Steam Navigation Company . [ http : //portal.pohub.com/pls/pogprtl/url/ITEM/1E71EC45AF8D6696E0440003BA2CA8EA A Brief History of P & O ] It won its first contract to deliver mail in 1837 . In 1840 , it began mail delivery to Alexandria , Egypt , via Gibraltar and Malta . The company was incorporated by Royal Charter the same year , becoming the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company .   P & O first introduced passenger cruising services in 1844 , advertising sea tours to destinations such as Gibraltar , Malta and Athens , sailing from Southampton . The forerunner of modern cruise holidays , these voyages were the first of their kind , and P & O Cruises has been recognised as the world 's oldest cruise line . The company later introduced round trips to destinations such as Alexandria and Constantinople . It underwent a period of rapid expansion in the latter half of the 19th century , commissioning larger and more luxurious ships to serve the steadily expanding market ."], [5, 'Fish are consumed as food by many species , including humans . It has been an important source of protein and other nutrients for humans throughout recorded history .   In culinary and fishery contexts , the term fish can also include shellfish , such as molluscs , crustaceans and echinoderms . English does not distinguish between fish as an animal and the food prepared from it , as it does with pig vs. pork or cow vs. beef . Some other languages do , as in the Spanish peces versus pescado . The modern English word for fish comes from the Old English word fisc ( plural : fiscas ) which was pronounced as it is today . English also has the term seafood , which covers fish found in the seas and oceans as well as other marine life used as food .   Species   Over 32,000 species of fish have been described , making them the most diverse group of vertebrates . In addition , there are many species of shellfish . However , only a small number of species are commonly eaten by humans .   Preparation   Fish can be prepared in a variety of ways . It can be uncooked ( raw ) ( cf . sashimi ) . It can be cured by marinating ( cf . ceviche ) , pickling ( cf . pickled herring ) , or smoking ( cf . smoked salmon ) . Or it can be cooked by baking , frying ( cf . fish and chips ) , grilling , poaching ( cf . court-bouillon ) , or steaming . Many of the preservation techniques used in different cultures have since become unnecessary but are still performed for their resulting taste and texture when consumed .   Nutritional value   `` Fish provides a good source of high quality protein and contains many vitamins and minerals . It may be classed as either whitefish , oily fish , or shellfish . Whitefish , such as haddock and seer , contain very little fat ( usually less than 1 % ) whereas oily fish , such as sardines , contain between 10-25 % . The latter , as a result of its high fat content , contain a range of fat-soluble vitamins ( A , D , E and K ) and essential fatty acids , all of which are vital for the healthy functioning of the body . `` Fellows P and Hampton A ( Eds . ) ( 1992 ) [ http : //www.fao.org/Wairdocs/X5434E/x5434e0f.htm # 11. % 20fish % 20and % 20fish % 20products Fish and fish products ] Chapter 11 in : Small-scale food processing - A guide for appropriate equipment Intermediate Technology Publications , FAO , Rome . ISBN 1 85339 108 5 .   Health benefits   Research over the past few decades has shown that the nutrients and minerals in fish , and particularly the omega-3 fatty acids found in pelagic fishes , are heart-friendly and can make improvements in brain development and reproduction . This has highlighted the role for fish in the functionality of the human body .   Health hazards   Fish is the most common food to obstruct the airway and cause choking . Choking on fish was responsible for about 4,500 reported accidents in the UK in 1998 .   Allergens   A seafood allergy is a hypersensitivity to an allergen which can be present in fish , and particularly in shellfish . This can result in an overreaction of the immune system and lead to severe physical symptoms . Most people who have a food allergy also have a seafood allergy . Allergic reactions can result from ingesting seafood , or by breathing in vapours from preparing or cooking seafood . The most severe seafood allergy reaction is anaphylaxis , an emergency requiring immediate attention . It is treated with epinephrine .   Biotoxins   Some species of fish , notably the puffer fugu used for sushi , and some kinds of shellfish , can result in serious poisoning if not prepared properly . These fish always contain these poisons as a defense against predators ; it is not present due to environmental circumstances . Particularly , fugu has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the national examination in Japan . Ciguatera poisoning can occur from eating larger fish from warm tropical waters , such as sea bass , grouper , and red snapper .

Herbaceous plants may be annuals , biennials or perennials .   Annual herbaceous plants die completely at the end of the growing season or when they have flowered and fruited , and they then grow again from seed .   Herbaceous perennial and biennial plants may have stems that die at the end of the growing season , but parts of the plant survive under or close to the ground from season to season ( for biennials , until the next growing season , when they flower and die ) . New growth develops from living tissues remaining on or under the ground , including roots , a caudex ( a thickened portion of the stem at ground level ) or various types of underground stems , such as bulbs , corms , stolons , rhizomes and tubers . Examples of herbaceous biennials include carrot , parsnip and common ragwort ; herbaceous perennials include potato , peony , hosta , mint , most ferns and most grasses . By contrast , non-herbaceous perennial plants are woody plants which have stems above ground that remain alive during the dormant season and grow shoots the next year from the above-ground parts – these include trees , shrubs and vines .   Some relatively fast-growing herbaceous plants ( especially annuals ) are pioneers , or early-successional species . Others form the main vegetation of many stable habitats , occurring for example in the ground layer of forests , or in naturally open habitats such as meadow , salt marsh or desert .   Some herbaceous plants can grow rather large , such as the Musa genus , to which the banana belongs .   The age of some herbaceous perennial plants can be determined by analyzing annual growth rings in the secondary root xylem , a method called herbchronology .'], [7, "Natural history is the research and study of organisms including animals , fungi and plants in their environment , leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study . It encompasses scientific research but is not limited to it , with articles nowadays more often published in science magazines than in academic journals . Grouped among the natural sciences , natural history is the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms . That is a very broad designation in a world filled with many narrowly focused disciplines . So while natural history dates historically from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the mediaeval Arabic world , through to European Renaissance naturalists working in near isolation , today 's field is more of a cross discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences . For example , geobiology has a strong multi-disciplinary nature combining scientists and scientific knowledge of many specialty sciences .   A person who studies natural history is known as a naturalist or natural historian .   Definitions   Pre-twentieth-century   The English term `` natural history '' is a translation of the Latin historia naturalis . Its meaning has narrowed progressively with time , while the meaning of the related term `` nature '' has widened ( see also History below ) . In antiquity , it covered essentially anything connected with nature or which used materials drawn from nature . For example , Pliny the Elder 's encyclopedia of this title , published circa 77 to 79 AD , covers astronomy , geography , man and his technology , medicine and superstition as well as animals and plants .   Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions : the humanities ( primarily what is now known as classics ) and divinity , with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment . The study of nature revived in the Renaissance , and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge , itself divided into descriptive natural history and natural philosophy , the analytical study of nature . In modern terms , natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern physics and chemistry , while natural history included the biological and geological sciences . The two were strongly associated . During the heyday of the gentleman scientists , many people contributed to both fields , and early papers in both were commonly read at professional science society meetings such as the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences – both founded during the seventeenth century .   Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives , such as Linnaeus ' aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden . Similarly , the Industrial Revolution prompted the development of geology to help find useful mineral deposits .   The astronomer , William Herschel was also a natural historian . Instead of working with plants or minerals he worked with the stars . He spent his time building telescopes to see the stars and the rest of the time watching the stars . In the beginning , he believed there to be an object known as a nebulae , but then later realized it was just another stage in star development . Herschel can be considered a natural historian because he observed the natural world and attempted to understand it . In the process he made charts of all the stars and kept records of all that he saw ( while his sister Caroline did all the documenting ) .   Post-nineteenth-century   Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources , and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field , creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them . For example , while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study , it can also be defined as a body of knowledge , and as a craft or a practice , in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed .   Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment , as seen in this definition by Marston Bates : `` Natural history is the study of animals and Plants – of organisms . ... I like to think , then , of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual – of what plants and animals do , how they react to each other and their environment , how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities '' and this more recent definition by D.S . Wilcove and T."], [8, "A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land . More broadly , `` the sea '' is the interconnected system of Earth 's salty , oceanic waters—considered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions . The sea moderates Earth 's climate and has important roles in the water cycle , carbon cycle , and nitrogen cycle . Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory , the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s . The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including the IHO 's four named oceans ( the Atlantic , Pacific , Indian , and Arctic ) and the Southern Ocean ; smaller , second-order sections , such as the Mediterranean , are known as seas .   Owing to the present state of continental drift , the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea ( a ratio of about 2:3 ) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic ( 1:4.7 ) .Reddy , M.P.M .

Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5 % by mass , although this can vary in more landlocked waters , near the mouths of large rivers , or at great depths . About 85 % of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride . Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature . Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides , the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun . The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth ( the Coriolis effect ) .   Former changes in the sea levels have left continental shelves , shallow areas in the sea close to land . These nutrient-rich waters teem with life , which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish , but also shellfish , mammals , and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed . The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs . Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales ' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting . Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters : even under enormous depths and pressures , nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem . Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth 's atmosphere ; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea .   The sea is an essential aspect of human trade , travel , mineral extraction , and power generation . This has also made it essential to warfare and left major cities exposed to earthquakes and volcanoes from nearby faults ; powerful tsunami waves ; and hurricanes , typhoons , and cyclones produced in the tropics . This importance and duality has affected human culture , from early sea gods to the epic poetry of Homer to the changes induced by the Columbian Exchange , from Viking funerals to Basho 's haikus to hyperrealist marine art , and inspiring music ranging from the shanties in The Complaynt of Scotland to Rimsky-Korsakov 's `` The Sea and Sinbad 's Ship '' to A-mei 's `` Listen to the Sea '' . It is the scene of leisure activities including swimming , diving , surfing , and sailing . However , population growth , industrialization , and intensive farming have all contributed to present-day marine pollution . Atmospheric carbon dioxide is being absorbed in increasing amounts , lowering its pH in a process known as ocean acidification . The shared nature of the sea has made overfishing an increasing problem .   Definition   Both senses of sea date to Old English ; the larger sense has required a definite article since Early Middle English . As the term has been applied over time , there are no sharp distinctions between seas and oceans , although seas are smaller and are—with the notable exception of the Sargasso Sea created by the North Atlantic Gyre—usually bounded by land on a smaller scale than multiple continents . Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water , but the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake . There is no accepted technical"], [9, "An impresario ( from the Italian impresa , 'an enterprise or undertaking ' ) is a person who organizes and often finances concerts , plays or operas , performing a role similar to that of an artist manager or a film or television producer . The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera , in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s , the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season . The owners of the theatre , usually noble amateurs , charged the impresario with hiring a composer ( until the 1850s operas were expected to be new ) and the orchestra , singers , costumes and sets , all while assuming considerable financial risk . In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce Der Schauspieldirektor ( The Impresario ) . Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer ; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice , where his opera Orlando finto pazzo was followed by numerous others .   Alessandro Lanari ( 1787–1852 ) , who began as the owner of a shop that produced costumes , eliminated the middleman in a series of successful seasons he produced for the Teatro La Pergola , in Florence , which presented the premieres of the first version of Verdi 's Macbeth , two of Bellini 's operas and five of Donizetti 's , including Lucia di Lammermoor . Domenico Barbaia ( 1778–1841 ) began as a café waiter and made a fortune at La Scala , in Milan , where he was also in charge of the gambling operation and introduced roulette .   Modern use   The traditional term is still used in the entertainment industry to refer to a producer of concerts , tours and other events in music , opera , theatre and even rodeo . Important modern impresarios in the traditional sense include Thomas Beecham , Rudolf Bing , Sergei Diaghilev , Richard D'Oyly Carte , Fortune Gallo , Sol Hurok , Aaron Richmond , and jazz festival producer George Wein .   Application of term   The term is occasionally applied to others , such as independent art museum curators and conference organizers who have a leading role in orchestrating events .   Figurative impresarios   Jacques-Yves Cousteau said of himself that he was an impresario of scientists as an explorer and filmmaker who worked with scientists in underwater exploration . Nicholas Wade described James D. Watson and E. O. Wilson in The New York Times as impresarios of Charles Darwin 's works ."], [10, "Vatican City ( ; ; ) , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City ( ; ) , is a walled enclave within the city of Rome . With an area of approximately 44 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and a population of 842 , it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population .   It is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ( a type of theocracy ) ruled by the Bishop of Rome – the Pope . The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins . Since the return of the Popes from Avignon in 1377 , they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City , although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere .   Vatican City is distinct from the Holy See ( ) , which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.2 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe . The independent city-state , on the other hand , came into existence in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , which spoke of it as a new creation , not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States ( 756–1870 ) , which had previously encompassed much of central Italy . According to the terms of the treaty , the Holy See has `` full ownership , exclusive dominion , and sovereign authority and jurisdiction '' over the city-state .   Within Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter 's Basilica , the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican Museums . They feature some of the world 's most famous paintings and sculptures . The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and tourist mementos , fees for admission to museums , and the sale of publications .   Name   The name was first used in the Lateran Treaty , signed on 11 February 1929 , which established the modern city-state . The name is taken from Vatican Hill , the geographic location of the state . `` Vatican '' is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement , Vatica or Vaticum meaning garden , located in the general area the Romans called vaticanus ager , `` Vatican territory '' .   The official Italian name of the city is ' or , more formally , ' , meaning `` Vatican City State '' . Although the Holy See ( which is distinct from the Vatican City ) and the Catholic Church use Ecclesiastical Latin in official documents , the Vatican City officially uses Italian . The Latin name is ' ; this is used in official documents by not just the Holy See , but in most official Church and Papal documents .   History   Early history   The name `` Vatican '' was already in use in the time of the Roman Republic for a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome . Under the Roman Empire , many villas were constructed there , after Agrippina the Elder ( 14 BC – 18 October AD 33 ) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD . In AD 40 , her son , Emperor Caligula ( 31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41 ; r. 37–41 ) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers ( AD 40 ) that was later completed by Nero , the Circus Gaii et Neronis , usually called , simply , the Circus of Nero .   Even before the arrival of Christianity , it is supposed that this originally uninhabited part of Rome ( the ager vaticanus ) had long been considered sacred , or at least not available for habitation . A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby .   The particularly low quality of Vatican wine , even after the reclamation of the area , was commented on by the poet Martial ( 40 – between 102 and 104 AD ) . In AD 69 , the Year of the Four Emperors , when the northern army that brought Vitellius to power arrived in Rome , `` a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican , which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery ; and the Tiber being close by , the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed"], [11, "A nation state is a type of state that conjoins the political entity of a state to the cultural entity of a nation , from which it aims to derive its political legitimacy to rule and potentially its status as a sovereign state if one accepts the declarative theory of statehood as opposed to the constitutive theory.Such a definition is a working one : `` All attempts to develop terminological consensus around `` nation '' resulted in failure '' , concludes . Walker Connor , in [ ] discusses the impressions surrounding the characters of `` nation '' , `` ( sovereign ) state '' , `` nation state '' , and `` nationalism '' . Connor , who gave the term `` ethnonationalism '' wide currency , also discusses the tendency to confuse nation and state and the treatment of all states as if nation states . In Globalization and Belonging , Sheila L. Crouche discusses `` The Definitional Dilemma '' ( pp . 85ff ) .  A state is specifically a political and geopolitical entity , whilst a nation is a cultural and ethnic one . The term `` nation state '' implies that the two coincide , in that a state has chosen to adopt and endorse a specific cultural group as associated with it . `` Nation state '' formation can take place at different times in different parts of the world .   The concept of a nation state can be compared and contrasted with that of the multinational state , city state , empire , confederation , and other state formations with which it may overlap . The key distinction is the identification of a people with a polity in the `` nation state . ''   History and origins   The origins and early history of nation states are disputed . A major theoretical question is : `` Which came first , the nation or the nation state ? '' Scholars such as Steven Weber , David Woodward , and Jeremy Black have advanced the hypothesis that the nation state did n't arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source , nor was it an accident of history or political invention ; but is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in political economy , capitalism , mercantilism , political geography , and geography combined together with cartography and advances in map-making technologies . It was with these intellectual discoveries and technological advances that the nation state arose . For others , the nation existed first , then nationalist movements arose for sovereignty , and the nation state was created to meet that demand . Some `` modernization theories '' of nationalism see it as a product of government policies to unify and modernize an already existing state . Most theories see the nation state as a 19th-century European phenomenon , facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education , mass literacy and mass media . However , historians also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in Portugal and the Dutch Republic .   In France , Eric Hobsbawm argues , the French state preceded the formation of the French people . Hobsbawm considers that the state made the French nation , not French nationalism , which emerged at the end of the 19th century , the time of the Dreyfus Affair . At the time of the 1789 French Revolution , only half of the French people spoke some French , and 12-13 % spoke it `` fairly '' , according to Hobsbawm .   During the Italian unification , the number of people speaking the Italian language was even lower . The French state promoted the unification of various dialects and languages into the French language . The introduction of conscription and the Third Republic 's 1880s laws on public instruction , facilitated the creation of a national identity , under this theory .   Some nation states , such as Germany or Italy , came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by nationalists , during the 19th century . In both cases , the territory was previously divided among other states , some of them very small . The sense of common identity was at first a cultural movement , such as in the Völkisch movement in German-speaking states , which rapidly acquired a political significance . In these cases , the nationalist sentiment and the nationalist movement clearly precede the unification of the German and Italian nation states .   Historians Hans Kohn , Liah Greenfeld , Philip White and others have classified nations such as Germany or Italy , where cultural unification preceded state unification , as ethnic nations"], [12, "Croquet is a sport that involves hitting plastic or wooden balls with a mallet through hoops ( often called `` wickets '' in the United States ) embedded in a grass playing court .   History   The oldest document to bear the word croquet with a description of the modern game is the set of rules registered by Isaac Spratt in November 1856 with the Stationers ' Company in London . This record is now in the Public Record Office . In 1868 , the first croquet all-comers ' meet was held at Moreton-in-Marsh , Gloucestershire and in the same year the All England Croquet Club was formed at Wimbledon , London .   Regardless when and by what route it reached England and the British colonies in its recognizable form , croquet is , like golf , pall-mall , trucco , and kolven , among the later forms of ground billiards , which as a class have been popular in Western Europe back to at least the Late Middle Ages , with roots in classical antiquity , including sometimes the use of arches and pegs along with and balls and mallets or other striking sticks ( some more akin to modern field hockey sticks ) . By the 12th century , a team ball game called ' or ' , akin to a chaotic version of hockey or football ( depending on whether sticks were used ) , was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes ; it was attested in Cornwall as early as 1283 .   In the book Queen of Games : The History of Croquet , Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet , which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas .   The first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to Britain from France during the 1630–1685 reign of Charles II of England , and was played under the name of ' ( among other spellings , today usually pall-mall ) , derived ultimately from Latin words for ' '' ball and mallet ' ( the latter also found in the name of the earlier French game , ' ) . This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica , dated 1877 . In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England , Joseph Strutt , in 1611 , described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time : `` Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box [ wood ] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron , which he that can do at the fewest blows , or at the number agreed upon , wins . It is to be observed , that there are two of these arches , that is one at either end of the alley . The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second , and the walk in Saint James 's Park , now called the Mall , received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall , where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime . ''   While the name pall-mall and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere ( France and Italy ) , the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century . Some other early modern sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance ( as in golf ) , however an image in Strutt 's 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game ( balls on ground , hoop , bats and peg ) being played over a , garden-sized distance . The image 's caption describes the game as `` a curious ancient pastime '' , confirming that croquet games were not new in early nineteenth century England .   In Samuel Johnson 's 1755 dictionary , his definition of `` pall-mall '' clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet : `` A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring '' . However , there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game .   The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from Ireland during the 1850s , perhaps after being brought there from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches . Regular contact between Ireland and France had continued since the Norman invasion of Ireland in"], [13, "A tool is any physical item that can be used to achieve a goal , especially if the item is not consumed in the process . Tool use by humans dates back millions of years , and other animals are also known to employ simple tools .   Tools that are used in particular fields or activities may have different designations such as `` instrument '' , `` utensil '' , `` implement '' , `` machine '' , `` device , '' or `` apparatus '' . The set of tools needed to achieve a goal is `` equipment '' . The knowledge of constructing , obtaining and using tools is technology .   History   Anthropologists believe that the use of tools was an important step in the evolution of mankind.Sam Lilley , [ https : //books.google.com/books ? id  Cj0EAAAAMAAJ & qtools+history & dq  tools+history & pgis=1 Men , Machines and History : The Story of Tools and Machines in Relation to Social Progress ] , 1948 Cobbett Press . Because tools are used extensively by both humans and wild chimpanzees , it is widely assumed that the first routine use of tools took place prior to the divergence between the two species . These early tools , however , were likely made of perishable materials such as sticks , or consisted of unmodified stones that can not be distinguished from other stones as tools .   Stone artifacts only date back to about 2.5 million years ago . However , a 2010 study suggests the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis ate meat by carving animal carcasses with stone implements . This finding pushes back the earliest known use of stone tools among hominins to about 3.4 million years ago .   Finds of actual tools date back at least 2.6 million years in Ethiopia . One of the earliest distinguishable stone tool forms is the hand axe .   Up until recently , weapons found in digs were the only tools of “ early man ” that were studied and given importance . Now , more tools are recognized as culturally and historically relevant . As well as hunting , other activities required tools such as preparing food , “ …nutting , leatherworking , grain harvesting and woodworking… ” Included in this group are “ flake stone tools '' .   Tools are the most important items that the ancient humans used to climb to the top of the food chain ; by inventing tools , they were able to accomplish tasks that human bodies could not , such as using a spear or bow and arrow to kill prey , since their teeth were not sharp enough to pierce many animals ' skins . “ Man the hunter ” as the catalyst for Hominin change has been questioned . Based on marks on the bones at archaeological sites , it is now more evident that pre-humans were scavenging off of other predators ' carcasses rather than killing their own food .   Mechanical devices experienced a major expansion in their use in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome with the systematic employment of new energy sources , especially waterwheels . Their use expanded through the Dark Ages with the addition of windmills .   Machine tools occasioned a surge in producing new tools in the industrial revolution . Advocates of nanotechnology expect a similar surge as tools become microscopic in size .   Functions   One can classify tools according to their basic functions :   * Cutting and edge tools , such as the knife , scythe or sickle , are wedge-shaped implements that produce a shearing force along a narrow face . Ideally , the edge of the tool needs to be harder than the material being cut or else the blade will become dulled with repeated use . But even resilient tools will require periodic sharpening , which is the process of removing deformation wear from the edge . Other examples of cutting tools include gouges and drill bits .  * Moving tools move large and tiny items . Many are levers which give the user a mechanical advantage . Examples of force-concentrating tools include the hammer which moves a nail or the maul which moves a stake . These operate by applying physical compression to a surface . In the case of the screwdriver , the force is rotational and called torque . By contrast , an anvil concentrates force on an object being hammered by preventing it from moving away when struck . Writing implements deliver a fluid to a surface via compression to activate the ink cartridge . Grabbing and twisting nuts and bolts with pliers ,"], [14, "A weasel is a mammal of the genus Mustela of the family Mustelidae . The genus Mustela includes the least weasels , polecats , stoats , ferrets , and minks . Members of this genus are small , active predators , with long and slender bodies and short legs . The family Mustelidae ( which also includes badgers , otters , and wolverines ) is often referred to as the `` weasel family '' . In the UK , the term `` weasel '' usually refers to the smallest species Mustela nivalis .   Weasels vary in length from 173 to , females being smaller than the males , and usually have red or brown upper coats and white bellies ; some populations of some species moult to a wholly white coat in winter . They have long , slender bodies , which enable them to follow their prey into burrows . Their tails may be from 34 to long .   Weasels feed on small mammals , and have from time to time been considered vermin , since some species took poultry from farms , or rabbits from commercial warrens . They do on the other hand eat large numbers of rodents . They can be found all across the world except for Antarctica , Australia , and neighbouring islands .   Terminology   The English word `` weasel '' was originally applied to one species of the genus , the European form of the least weasel ( Mustela nivalis ) . This usage is retained in British English , where the name is also extended to cover several other small species of the genus . However , in technical discourse and in American usage , the term `` weasel '' can refer to any member of the genus , or to the genus as a whole . Of the 17 extant species currently classified in the genus Mustela , 10 have `` weasel '' in their common names . Among those that do not are the stoat , the polecats , the ferret , and the European mink . The American mink and the extinct sea mink were commonly included in this genus as Mustela vison and Mustela macrodon respectively , but in 1999 were moved to the genus Neovison .   Species   The following information is according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System .   1 Europe and northern Asia division excludes China .   Hybrids in this genus include the polecat-ferret hybrid and the polecat-mink hybrid .   Cultural meanings   Weasels have been assigned a variety of cultural meanings .   In Greek culture , a weasel near one 's house is a sign of bad luck , even evil , `` especially if there is in the household a girl about to be married '' , since the animal ( based on its Greek etymology ) was thought to be an unhappy bride who was transformed into a weasel and consequently delights in destroying wedding dresses . In neighboring Macedonia , however , weasels are generally seen as an omen of good fortune .   In early modern Mecklenburg , Germany , amulets from weasels were deemed to have strong magic ; the period between August 15 and September 8 was specifically designated for the killing of weasels .   In Montagne Noire ( France ) , Ruthenia , and the early medieval culture of the Wends , weasels were not meant to be killed .   In North America , Native Americans deemed the weasel to be a bad sign ; crossing its path meant a `` speedy death '' . According to Daniel Defoe also , meeting a weasel is a bad omen . In English-speaking areas , weasel can be a disparaging term , noun or verb , for someone regarded as sneaky , conniving or untrustworthy . Similarly , weasel words is a critical term for words or phrasing that are vague , misleading or equivocal .   Japanese folklore   In Japan , were seen as yōkai from time immemorial , and they cause various strange occurrences . According to the encyclopedia Wakan Sansai Zue from the Edo period , a nate of weasels would cause conflagrations , and the cry of a weasel was considered a harbinger of misfortune . In the Niigata Prefecture , the sound of a nate of weasels making a rustle resembled six people hulling rice , so was called the `` '' , and it was an omen for one 's home to decline or flourish . It is said that when people chase after this sound , the sound stops .   They are"], [15, "The piano is a musical instrument played using a keyboard , which is a row of keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands . Invented in about 1700 ( the exact date is uncertain ) , the piano is widely employed in classical , jazz , traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances , accompaniment , and for composing and rehearsal . Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones . With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed . The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced .   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments . The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe . During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings . By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key . Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case , soundboard , bridge , and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings .   Invention   The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori ( 1655–1731 ) of Padua , Italy , who was employed by Ferdinando de ' Medici , Grand Prince of Tuscany , as the Keeper of the Instruments ; he was an expert harpsichord maker , and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments . It is"], [16, "A golf course is the grounds where the game of golf is played . It comprises a series of holes , each consisting of a teeing ground , a fairway , the rough and other hazards , and a green with a flagstick ( `` pin '' ) and hole ( `` cup '' ) . A standard round of golf consists of eighteen holes . Most courses contain eighteen holes ; some share fairways or greens , and a subset has nine holes , played twice per round . Par-3 courses consist of nine or eighteen holes all of which have a par of three strokes .   Many older courses are links , often coastal . Courses are private , public , and municipally owned , and typically feature a pro shop . Many private courses are found at country clubs .   Design   Although a specialty within landscape design or landscape architecture , golf course architecture is considered a separate field of study . Some golf course architects become celebrities in their own right , such as Robert Trent Jones , Jr. ; others are professional golfers of high standing and demonstrated appreciation for golf course composition , notably Jack Nicklaus . The field is partially represented by the American Society of Golf Course Architects , the European Institute of Golf Course Architects , and the Society of Australian Golf Course Architects , though many of the finest golf course architects in the world choose not to become members of any such group , as associations of architects are not government-sanctioned licensing bodies , but private groups .   While golf courses often follow the original landscape , some modification is unavoidable . This is increasingly the case as new courses are more likely to be sited on less optimal land . Bunkers and sand traps are almost always artificial , although other hazards may be natural .   The layout of a fairway follows certain traditional principles , such as the number of holes ( nine and eighteen being most common ) , their par values , and the number of holes of each par value per course . It is also preferable to arrange greens to be close to the tee box of the next playable hole , to minimize travel distance while playing a round , and to vary the mix of shorter and longer holes . Combined with the need to package all the fairways within what is frequently a compact square or rectangular plot of land , the fairways of a course tend to form an oppositional tiling pattern . In complex areas , two holes may share the same tee box , fairway , or even green . It is also common for separate tee-off points to be positioned for men , women , and amateurs , each one respectively lying closer to the green . Eighteen-hole courses are traditionally broken down into a `` front 9 '' ( holes 1-9 ) and a `` back 9 '' ( holes 10-18 ) . On older courses ( especially links courses , like the Old Course at St. Andrews ) , the holes may be laid out in one long loop , beginning and ending at the clubhouse , and thus the front 9 is referred to on the scorecard as `` out '' ( heading out away from clubhouse ) and the back 9 as `` in '' ( heading back in toward the clubhouse ) . More recent courses ( and especially inland courses ) tend to be designed with the front 9 and the back 9 each constituting a separate loop beginning and ending at the clubhouse . This is partly for the convenience of the players and the club , as then it is easier to play just a 9-hole round , if preferred , or stop at the clubhouse for a snack between the front 9 and the back 9 .   A successful design is as visually pleasing as it is playable . With golf being a form of outdoor recreation , the strong designer is an adept student of natural landscaping who understands the aesthetic cohesion of vegetation , water bodies , paths , grasses , stonework , and woodwork , among other elements .   Par   Most golf courses have only par-3 , -4 , and -5 holes , though some courses include par-6 holes . ( The Ananti CC and the Satsuki golf course in Sano , Japan are the only courses with par 7 holes . Typical distances for the various holes from standard tees are as follows .

The United Kingdom fought the South African Republic ( Transvaal Republic ) and the Orange Free State . The British war effort was supported by troops from several regions of the British Empire , including Southern Africa , the Australian colonies , Canada , Newfoundland , British India , and New Zealand . The war ended in victory for the British and the annexation of both republics . Both would eventually be incorporated into the Union of South Africa in 1910 .   Name   The conflict is commonly referred to as simply the Boer War , since the First Boer War ( December 1880 to March 1881 ) is much less well known . `` Boer '' was the common term for Afrikaans-speaking settlers in southern Africa at the time . It is also known as the South African War outside South Africa and as the ( Second ) Anglo-Boer War among South Africans . In Afrikaans it may be called the Anglo-Boereoorlog ( `` Anglo-Boer War '' ) , Tweede Boereoorlog ( `` Second Boer War '' ) , Tweede Vryheidsoorlog ( `` Second Freedom War '' , i.e. , a war of liberation ) or Engelse oorlog ( `` English War '' ) . In South Africa it is officially called the South African War .   Origins   The complex origins of the war resulted from more than a century of conflict between the Boers and the British Empire , but of particular immediate importance was the question as to which nation would control and benefit most from the very lucrative Witwatersrand gold mines . During the Napoleonic Wars , a British military expedition landed in the Cape Colony and defeated the defending Dutch forces at the Battle of Blaauwberg ( 1806 ) . After the war , the British formally acquired the colony ( 1814 ) , and encouraged immigration by British settlers who were largely at odds with the Dutch settlers . Many Boers who were dissatisfied with aspects of British administration , in particular with Britain 's abolition of slavery on 1 December 1834 , elected to migrate away from British rule in what became known as the Great Trek .   The Trekkers initially followed the eastern coast towards Natal and then , after Britain annexed the Natal in 1843 , journeyed northwards towards the interior . There they established two independent Boer republics : the South African Republic ( 1852 ; also known as the Transvaal Republic ) and the Orange Free State ( 1854 ) . The British recognised the two Boer republics in 1852 and 1854 , but attempted British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 led to the First Boer War in 1880–81 . After the British suffered defeats , particularly at the Battle of Majuba Hill ( 1881 ) , the independence of the two republics was restored subject to certain conditions ; relations , however , remained uneasy .   In 1866 Erasmus Jacobs discovered diamonds at Kimberley , prompting a diamond rush and a massive influx of foreigners to the borders of the Orange Free State . Then in 1886 , an Australian discovered gold in the Witwatersrand area of the South African Republic . Gold made the Transvaal the richest and potentially the most powerful nation in southern Africa ; however , the country had neither the manpower nor the industrial base to develop the resource on its own . As a result , the Transvaal reluctantly acquiesced to the immigration of uitlanders ( foreigners ) , mainly from Britain , who came to the Boer region in search of fortune and employment . This resulted in the number of uitlanders in the Transvaal potentially exceeding the number of Boers , and precipitated confrontations between the earlier-arrived Boer settlers and the newer , non-Boer arrivals .   British expansionist ideas ( notably propagated by Cecil Rhodes ) as well as disputes over uitlander political and economic rights resulted in the failed Jameson Raid of 1895 . Dr. Leander Starr Jameson , who led the raid , intended to encourage an uprising of the uitlanders in Johannesburg . However , the uitlanders did not take up arms in support , and Transvaal government forces surrounded the column and captured Jameson 's men before they could reach Johannesburg .   As tensions escalated , political manoeuvrings and negotiations attempted to reach compromise on the issues of the rights of the uitlanders within the South African Republic , control of"], [18, "The history of the camera can be traced much further back than the introduction of photography . Cameras evolved from the camera obscura , and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology , including daguerreotypes , calotypes , dry plates , film , and digital cameras .   Camera obscura   Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura , a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese and ancient Greeks , which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface .   An Arab physicist , Ibn al-Haytham , published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD . He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter . Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images . Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura .   On 24 January 1544 mathematician and instrument maker Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University used one to watch a solar eclipse , publishing a diagram of his method in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico in the following year . In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing .   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them . The earliest cameras were room-sized , with space for one or more people inside ; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce 's time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available . The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685 , though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible .   Early fixed images   The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce ,   using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride , which darkened where it was exposed to light . No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce , so the photograph was not permanent , eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it . In the mid-1820s , Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea . The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image . The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away . One of those photographs has survived .   Daguerreotypes and calotypes   After Niépce 's death in 1833 , his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process , which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839 . Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide . After exposure in the camera , the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt ( sodium chloride ) . Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process , the calotype , in 1840 . As commercialized , both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes . The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus . After focusing , the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped . Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder , uncapped the lens , and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder . Despite this mechanical simplicity , high-quality achromatic lenses were standard .   Dry plates   Collodion dry plates had been available since 1855 , thanks to the work of Désiré van Monckhoven , but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed . The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called `` instantaneous '' snapshot exposures practical . For the first time , a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity . With daylight and a fast plate or film , a small camera could be hand-held while taking the picture . The ranks of amateur photographers swelled and"], [19, "Marlon Brando , Jr. ( April 3 , 1924 – July 1 , 2004 ) was an American actor , film director , and activist . He is credited with bringing a gripping realism to film acting , and is often cited as one of the greatest and most influential actors of all time . He helped to popularize the Stanislavski system of acting , today more commonly referred to as method acting . Brando is most famous for his Academy Award-winning performances as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront ( 1954 ) and Vito Corleone in The Godfather ( 1972 ) , as well as influential performances in A Streetcar Named Desire ( 1951 ) , Viva Zapata ! ( 1952 ) , Julius Caesar ( 1953 ) , The Wild One ( 1953 ) , Reflections in a Golden Eye ( 1967 ) , Last Tango in Paris ( 1972 ) , and Apocalypse Now ( 1979 ) . Brando was also an activist for many causes , notably the African-American Civil Rights Movement and various Native American movements .   He initially gained acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams ' play A Streetcar Named Desire , a role that he had originated successfully on Broadway . He received further praise for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront , and his portrayal of the rebel motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture . Brando received Academy Award nominations for playing Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata ! ; Mark Antony in Joseph L. Mankiewicz 's 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar ; and Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in Sayonara ( 1957 ) , an adaption of James Michener 's 1954 novel . Brando was included in a list of Top Ten Money Making Stars three times in the 1950s , coming in at number 10 in 1954 , number 6 in 1955 , and number 4 in 1958 .   The 1960s proved to be a fallow decade for Brando . He directed and starred in the cult western film One-Eyed Jacks , a critical and commercial flop , after which he delivered a series of box-office failures , beginning with the 1962 film adaptation of the novel Mutiny on the Bounty . After 10 years , during which he did not appear in a successful film , he won his second Academy Award for playing Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola 's The Godfather , a role critics consider among his greatest . The Godfather was then one of the most commercially successful films of all time . With that and his Oscar-nominated performance in Last Tango in Paris , Brando re-established himself in the ranks of top box-office stars , placing sixth and tenth in the Money Making Stars poll in 1972 and 1973 , respectively . Brando took a four-year hiatus before appearing in The Missouri Breaks ( 1976 ) . After this , he was content with being a highly paid character actor in cameo roles , such as in Superman ( 1978 ) and The Formula ( 1980 ) , before taking a nine-year break from motion pictures . According to the Guinness Book of World Records , Brando was paid a record $ 3.7 million ( $ million in inflation-adjusted dollars ) and 11.75 % of the gross profits for 13 days ' work on Superman . He finished out the 1970s with his controversial performance as Colonel Kurtz in another Coppola film , Apocalypse Now , a box-office hit for which he was highly paid and which helped finance his career layoff during the 1980s .   Brando was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest movie star among male movie stars whose screen debuts occurred in or before 1950 . He was one of only three professional actors , along with Charlie Chaplin and Marilyn Monroe , named in 1999 by Time magazine as one of its 100 Most Important People of the Century . He died of respiratory failure on July 1 , 2004 , at age 80 .   Early life   Brando was born on April 3 , 1924 , in Omaha , Nebraska , to Marlon Brando , Sr. , a pesticide and chemical feed manufacturer , and Dorothy Julia ( née Pennebaker ) . Brando had two older sisters , Jocelyn Brando ( 1919–2005 ) and Frances ( 1922–1994 ) . His ancestry included German , Dutch , English , and Irish . His patrilineal immigrant ancestor , Johann Wilhelm Brandau , arrived in New York in"], [20, "Luigina `` Gina '' Lollobrigida ( ; born 4 July 1927 ) is an Italian actress , photojournalist and sculptor . She was one of the highest profile European actresses of the 1950s and early 1960s , a period in which she was an international sex symbol .   As her film career slowed , she established second careers as a photojournalist and sculptor . In the 1970s , she achieved a scoop by gaining access to Fidel Castro for an exclusive interview .   She has continued as an active supporter of Italian and Italian American causes , particularly the National Italian American Foundation ( NIAF ) . In 2008 , she received the NIAF Lifetime Achievement Award at the Foundation 's Anniversary Gala . In 2013 , she sold her jewelry collection , and donated the nearly $ 5 million from the sale to benefit stem cell therapy research .   Youth   Born Luigina Lollobrigida in Subiaco , Italy , she is one of four daughters of a furniture manufacturer and his wife . Her sisters are Giuliana ( b . 1924 ) , Maria ( b . 1929 ) and Fernanda ( 1930–2011 ) . In her youth , Lollobrigida did some modelling , and from that , she participated successfully in several beauty contests . At around this time , she began appearing in Italian films in minor roles .   In 1945 , at age 18 , she played a part in the comedy Santarellina by Eduardo Scarpetta at the Teatro della Concordia of Monte Castello di Vibio . ( It is the smallest theatre all'italiana in the world . )   In 1947 , Lollobrigida entered the Miss Italia pageant and came in third place , giving her national exposure .   Career   Cinema   In 1950 , Howard Hughes invited Lollobrigida to work in Hollywood , but she refused , preferring to remain in Europe ; this decision prevented her from working in American movies filmed in the USA until 1959 , though not from working in American productions shot in Europe . Her performance in Bread , Love and Dreams ( Pane , amore e fantasia , 1953 ) led to her receiving a BAFTA nomination and won a Nastro d'Argento award . Lollobrigida also appeared in The Wayward Wife ( 1953 ) and in Woman of Rome ( 1954 ) . These were three of her most renowned Italian films , but she worked also in the French industry on such films as Fearless Little Soldier ( Fanfan la Tulipe , 1952 ) , Beauties of the Night ( Les Belles de nuit , also 1952 ) and Le Grand Jeu ( 1954 ) .   Her first widely seen English language film was Beat the Devil ( 1953 ) , a film which was shot in Italy . In this film , directed by John Huston , she played the wife of Humphrey Bogart , with Jennifer Jones as her rival . She then took part in the Italian-American production Crossed Swords ( 1954 ) , co-starring with Errol Flynn . Her appearance in The World 's Most Beautiful Woman ( also known as Beautiful But Dangerous , 1955 ) led to her receiving the first David di Donatello for Best Actress award ; in this film she interpreted the Italian soprano Lina Cavalieri , singing some arias from Tosca with her own voice . She had the principal female lead in the circus drama Trapeze ( 1956 ) directed by Carol Reed co-starring with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis and in The Hunchback of Notre Dame ( 1956 ) , appeared as Esmeralda with Anthony Quinn as Quasimodo . The film was directed by Jean Delannoy .   In 1959 , she appeared in the French movie The Law , alongside Yves Montand and Marcello Mastroianni ; then , she co-starred with Frank Sinatra in Never So Few ( 1959 ) and with Yul Brynner in Solomon and Sheba ( also 1959 ) . The latter was the last film directed by King Vidor , and features an almost unique orgy scene in Hollywood motion pictures of that era ; furthermore , Brynner was chosen to substitute Tyrone Power , who died before the shots were completed .   In the romantic comedy Come September ( 1961 ) , Lollobrigida had a leading role along with Rock Hudson , Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin . It was a film for which she won a Golden Globe Award . She appeared , also in 1961 , with Ernest Borgnine and Anthony Franciosa in the drama Go Naked in the World .

Richard has sold more than 250 million records worldwide . He has total sales of over 21 million singles in the UK and is the third-top-selling artist in UK Singles Chart history , behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley .   With his backing group , the Shadows , Richard , originally positioned as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard and Elvis Presley , dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s and early 1960s . His 1958 hit single , `` Move It '' , is often described as Britain 's first authentic rock and roll song , and John Lennon once claimed that `` before Cliff and the Shadows , there had been nothing worth listening to in British music . '' Increased focus on his Christian faith and subsequent softening of his music later led to a more middle of the road pop image , and he sometimes ventured into contemporary Christian music .   Over a career spanning more than 50 years Richard has amassed many gold and platinum discs and awards , including three Brit Awards—winning Best British Male twice and the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music , and two Ivor Novello Awards . He has had more than 130 singles , albums and EPs make the UK Top 20 , more than any other artist and holds the record ( with Elvis Presley ) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades ( 1950s–2000s ) . He has achieved 14 UK No . 1 singles , and is the only singer to have had a No . 1 single in the UK in five consecutive decades : the 1950s through to the 1990s .   In 2008 , he celebrated his 50th anniversary in music by releasing a greatest hits album , featuring the new track `` Thank You for a Lifetime '' , which reached No . 3 in the UK singles chart . In November 2013 , Richard released The Fabulous Rock 'n ' Roll Songbook , which became the 100th album of his career .   Richard has never achieved the same impact in the United States despite eight US Top 40 singles , including the million-selling `` Devil Woman '' and `` We Do n't Talk Anymore , '' the latter becoming the first to reach the Billboard Hot 100 's top 40 in the 1980s by a singer who had been in the Billboard top 40 in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s . In Canada , Richard achieved comparatively more success , with a successful period in the early 1960s , and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s with some singles and albums reaching gold and platinum status . He has remained a popular music , film , and television personality in Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Northern Europe and Asia , and he retains a following in other countries .   Richard has been a resident in the United Kingdom for most of his life , but in 2010 , he confirmed that he had become a citizen of Barbados . He divides his time between living in Barbados and Portugal .   Biography   1940–58 : Childhood and adolescence   Harry Rodger Webb was born in India at King George 's Hospital , Victoria Street , in Lucknow , which was then part of British India ( or the British Raj ) . His parents were Rodger Oscar Webb , a manager for a catering contractor that serviced the Indian Railways , and the former Dorothy Marie Dazely . Richard is primarily of English heritage , but he has one great-grandmother who was of half Welsh and half Spanish descent , born of a Spanish great-great-grandmother named Emiline Joseph Rebeiro .   The Webb family lived in a modest home in Maqbara , near the main shopping centre of Hazratganj . Dorothy 's mother served as the dormitory matron at the La Martiniere Girls ' School . Richard has three sisters .   In 1948 , following Indian independence , the family embarked on a three-week sea voyage to Tilbury , Essex , England aboard the .

One team , designated the batting team , attempts to score as many runs as possible , whilst their opponents field . Each phase of play is called an innings . After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a set number of overs have been completed , the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles . The winning team is the one that scores the most runs , including any extras gained , during their period batting .   At the start of each game , two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play . The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team , known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , towards a set of wooden stumps , in front of which stands one of the batsmen , known as the striker . The striker 's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat , and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs . The other batsman , known as the non-striker , waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler . The bowler 's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman , at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease .   The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball , leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat , and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground . Runs are scored through two main methods : either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary , or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball . If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground , a run-out occurs . Adjudication is performed on-field by two umpires .   The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) and Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs , to Test cricket , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece . Traditionally , cricketers play in all-white kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard , solid object made of compressed leather enclosing a cork core .   Although cricket 's origins are uncertain , it is first recorded in south-east England in the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the mid-19th century . ICC , the game 's governing body , has over 100 members , ten of which are full members who play Test cricket . Women 's cricket , which is organised and played separately , has also achieved international standard . Cricket is the world 's second most popular spectator sport , after association football , and is followed primarily in Australasia , Great Britain and Ireland , the Indian subcontinent , southern Africa and the West Indies .   Etymology   A number of words have been suggested as sources for the term `` cricket '' . In the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598 it is called creckett . One possible source for the name is the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.Birley , p. 3 . In Samuel Johnson 's Dictionary , he derived cricket from `` cryce , Saxon , a stick '' . In Old French , the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick .

He grew up in Anchorage , Alaska . From an early age he has been interested in philosophy . Sanger received a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Reed College in 1991 and a Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy from Ohio State University in 2000 . Most of his philosophical work has focused on epistemology , the theory of knowledge .   He has been involved with various online encyclopedia projects . He is the former editor-in-chief of Nupedia ,  chief organizer ( 2001–02 ) of its successor , Wikipedia , and founding editor-in-chief of Citizendium . From his position at Nupedia , he assembled the process for article development . Sanger proposed implementing a wiki , which led directly to the creation of Wikipedia . Initially Wikipedia was a complementary project for Nupedia . He was Wikipedia 's early community leader and established many of its original policies .   Sanger left Wikipedia in 2002 , and has since been critical of the project . He states that , despite its merits , Wikipedia lacks credibility due to , among other things , a lack of respect for expertise . In October 2006 , Sanger started a somewhat similar encyclopedia to Wikipedia , Citizendium .   Sanger has taught philosophy at Ohio State University and was an early strategist for the expert-authored Encyclopedia of Earth . He has worked on developing educational projects for individuals behind WatchKnowLearn . He has designed a web-based reading program named Reading Bear which aims to teach children how to read . In February 2013 , he attempted to start a news crowdsourcing project named Infobitt ; it ran out of money in mid-2015 without the code being ready to handle a fullscale launch .   Early life and education   Sanger was born in Bellevue , Washington . His father was a marine biologist and his mother cared for the children .  When he was seven years old , the family moved to Anchorage , Alaska .  At an early age , he was interested in philosophical topics .   He graduated from high school in 1986 and went off to Reed College , majoring in philosophy . In college he became interested in the Internet and its publishing abilities .  He set up a listserver as a medium for students and tutors to meet up for `` expert tutoring '' and `` to act as a forum for discussion of tutorials , tutorial methods , and the possibility and merits of a voluntary , free network of individual tutors and students finding each other via the Internet for education outside the traditional university setting . ''  He started and moderated a philosophy discussion list , the Association for Systematic Philosophy .  Sanger wrote in 1994 a manifesto for the discussion group :   The history of philosophy is full of disagreement and confusion . One reaction by philosophers to this state of things is to doubt whether the truth about philosophy can ever be known , or whether there is any such thing as the truth about philosophy . But there is another reaction : one may set out to think more carefully and methodically than one 's intellectual forebears .   Sanger received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from Reed College in 1991 , a Master of Arts from Ohio State University in 1995 , and a Doctor of Philosophy from Ohio State University in 2000 . Beginning in 1998 he ran a website called `` Sanger 's Review of Y2K News Reports '' , a resource for those concerned about the year 2000 problem , such as managers of computer systems .   Philosophy   In 2007 , Sanger examined the possibilities for education online . He explained , `` Imagine that education were not delivered but organized and managed in a way that were fully digitized , decentralized , self-directed , asynchronous , and at-a-distance . '' He further stated , `` There would be no bureaucracy to enforce anything beyond some very basic rules , and decision-making would be placed almost entirely in the hands of teachers and students . ''   In 2007 , Sanger wrote an essay for the Edge stating in part :   As it turns out , our many Web 2.0 revolutionaries have been so thoroughly seized with the successes of strong collaboration that they are resistant to recognizing some hard truths .

The war is also known under other names , such as the Persian Gulf War , First Gulf War , Gulf War I , Kuwait War , First Iraq War , or Iraq War before the term `` Iraq War '' became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War ( also referred to in the U.S. as `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' ) .  The Iraqi Army 's occupation of Kuwait that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation , and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N. Security Council . U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia , and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene . An array of nations joined the Coalition , the largest military alliance since World War II . The great majority of the Coalition 's military forces were from the U.S. , with Saudi Arabia , the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors , in that order . Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US $ 32 billion of the US $ 60 billion cost .   The war was marked by the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle , principally by the U.S. network CNN . The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast of images from cameras on board U.S. bombers during Operation Desert Storm .   The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991 , continuing for five weeks . This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February . This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces , who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory . The Coalition ceased its advance , and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started . Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq , Kuwait , and areas on Saudi Arabia 's border . Iraq launched Scud missiles against Coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel .   Terminology   The following names have been used to describe the conflict itself :  * Gulf War and Persian Gulf War have been the most common terms for the conflict used within western countries . A problem with these terms is that the usage is ambiguous , having now been applied to at least three conflicts : see Gulf War ( disambiguation ) . The use of the term Persian Gulf ( as opposed to Arabian Gulf ) is also disputed : see Persian Gulf naming dispute . With no consensus of naming , various publications have attempted to refine the name . Some variants include :  * * Gulf War ( e.g . The Gulf War , BBC television series , 2005 ; Modern Conflicts : The Gulf War , Discovery Channel DVD set , 2010 )  * * Persian Gulf War ( e.g .

The show 's comedy sketches , which parody contemporary culture and politics , are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members . Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest ( who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast ) and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it 's Saturday Night ! `` , properly beginning the show .   In 1980 Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities . He was replaced by Jean Doumanian , who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews . Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera . Others associated with the show , such as writers , have gone on to successful careers creating , writing , or starring in TV and film .   Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC 's headquarters in the Comcast Building , SNL has aired 808 episodes since its debut , and concluded its forty-first season on May 21 , 2016 , making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States . The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries , including Canada , Spain , Italy , South Korea , Japan , Brazil , and Finland , each meeting with different levels of success . Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers ( 1980 ) and Wayne 's World ( 1992 ) . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of '' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show .   Throughout four decades on air , Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards , including 42 Primetime Emmy Awards , two Peabody Awards , and three Writers Guild of America Awards . In 2000 , it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame . It was ranked tenth in TV Guide `` 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time '' list , and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine 's `` 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME '' . As of 2012 , it has received 156 Emmy nominations , the most received by any TV show . The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship , with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests .   Development    From 1965 until September 1975 , NBC ran The Best of Carson reruns of The Tonight Show , airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates ' discretion ( originally known as The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson ) . In 1974 Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weeknights , allowing him to take time off .   In 1974 NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming , Dick Ebersol , and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot . At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller , Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels . Over the next three weeks , Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter 's idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches , political satire , and music performances . By 1975 Michaels had assembled a talented cast , including Dan Aykroyd , John Belushi , Chevy Chase , Jane Curtin , Garrett Morris , Laraine Newman , Michael O'Donoghue , Gilda Radner , and George Coe . The show was originally called NBC 's Saturday Night , because Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC . NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26 , 1977"], [27, "Food coloring , or color additive , is any dye , pigment or substance that imparts color when it is added to food or drink . They come in many forms consisting of liquids , powders , gels , and pastes . Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in domestic cooking . Due to its safety and general availability , food coloring is also used in a variety of non-food applications including cosmetics , pharmaceuticals , home craft projects , and medical devices .   Purpose of food coloring   People associate certain colors with certain flavors , and the color of food can influence the perceived flavor in anything from candy to wine . Sometimes the aim is to simulate a color that is perceived by the consumer as natural , such as adding red coloring to glacé cherries ( which would otherwise be beige ) , but sometimes it is for effect , like the green ketchup that Heinz launched in 1999 . Color additives are used in foods for many reasons including :   * Offset color loss due to exposure to light , air , temperature extremes , moisture and storage conditions  * Correct natural variations in color  * Enhance colors that occur naturally  * Provide color to colorless and `` fun '' foods  * Make food more attractive and appetizing , and informative  * Allow consumers to identify products on sight , like candy flavors or medicine dosages   File : Indigo carmine.svg | Indigo carmine , which is blue .

Regulation   Past use and regulation history   The addition of colorants to foods is thought to have occurred in Egyptian cities as early as 1500 BC , when candy makers added natural extracts and wine to improve the products ' appearance . During the Middle Ages , the economy in the European countries was based on agriculture , and the peasants were accustomed to producing their own food locally or trading within the village communities . Under feudalism , aesthetic aspects were not considered , at least not by the vast majority of the generally very poor population . This situation changed with urbanization at the beginning of the Modern Age , when trade emerged—especially the import of precious spices and colors . One of the very first food laws , created in Augsburg , Germany , in 1531 , concerned spices or colorants and required saffron counterfeiters to be burned .   With the onset of the industrial revolution , people became dependent on foods produced by others . These new urban dwellers demanded food at low cost . Analytical chemistry was still primitive and regulations few . The adulteration of foods flourished . Heavy metal and other inorganic element-containing compounds turned out to be cheap and suitable to `` restore '' the color of watered-down milk and other foodstuffs , some more lurid examples being :  * Red lead ( Pb3O4 ) and vermillion ( HgS ) were routinely used to color cheese and confectionery .  * Copper arsenite ( CuHAsO3 ) was used to recolor used tea leaves for resale . It also caused two deaths when used to color a dessert in 1860 .   Sellers at the time offered more than 80 artificial coloring agents , some invented for dyeing textiles , not foods . Many color additives had never been tested for toxicity or other adverse effects . Historical records show that injuries , even deaths , resulted from tainted colorants . In 1851 , about 200 people were poisoned in England , 17 of them fatally , directly as a result of eating adulterated lozenges . In 1856 , mauveine , the first synthetic color , was developed by Sir William Henry Perkin and by the turn of the century , unmonitored color additives had spread through Europe and the United States in all sorts of popular foods , including ketchup , mustard , jellies , and wine .   Concerns over food safety led to numerous regulations throughout the world , . German food regulations released in 1882 stipulated the exclusion of dangerous minerals such as arsenic , copper , chromium , lead , mercury and zinc , which were frequently used as ingredients in colorants"], [28, "Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh ( Philip Mountbatten ; born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark on 10 June 1921 ) is the husband of Queen Elizabeth II . He is the longest-serving consort of a reigning British monarch and the oldest-ever male member of the British royal family .   A member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg , Philip was born into the Greek and Danish royal families . He was born in Greece but his family was exiled from the country when he was still an infant . After being educated in France , Germany , and the United Kingdom , he joined the Royal Navy in 1939 , at the age of 18 . From July 1939 , he began corresponding with the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth ( his third cousin through Queen Victoria and second cousin once removed through Christian IX of Denmark ) , whom he had first met in 1934 . During World War II he served with the Mediterranean and Pacific fleets .   After the war , Philip was granted permission by George VI to marry Elizabeth . Before the official announcement of their engagement , he abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles and became a naturalised British subject , adopting the surname Mountbatten from his maternal grandparents . After an engagement of five months , he married Elizabeth on 20 November 1947 . Just before the wedding , the King granted him the style of His Royal Highness and the title Duke of Edinburgh . Philip left active military service when Elizabeth became Queen in 1952 , having reached the rank of commander . His wife made him a prince of the United Kingdom in 1957 .   Philip has four children with Elizabeth : Prince Charles , Princess Anne , Prince Andrew , and Prince Edward . He has eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren . Through a British Order in Council issued in 1960 , descendants of Philip and Elizabeth not bearing royal styles and titles can use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor , which has also been used by some members of the royal family who do hold titles , such as Charles and Anne .   A keen sports enthusiast , Philip helped develop the equestrian event of carriage driving . He is a patron of over 800 organisations and serves as chairman of the Duke of Edinburgh 's Award scheme for people aged 14 to 24 .   Early life   Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921 , the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg . Philip 's four elder sisters were Margarita , Theodora , Cecilie , and Sophie . He was baptised into the Greek Orthodox Church . His godparents were Queen Olga of Greece ( his paternal grandmother ) and the Mayor of Corfu .   Shortly after Philip 's birth , his maternal grandfather , Prince Louis of Battenberg , then known as Louis Mountbatten , Marquess of Milford Haven , died in London . Louis was a naturalised British citizen , who , after a career in the Royal Navy , had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War . After visiting London for the memorial , Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the Greco-Turkish War ( 1919–1922 ) .   The war went badly for Greece , and the Turks made large gains . On 22 September 1922 , Philip 's uncle , King Constantine I , was forced to abdicate , and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew , along with others . The commander of the army , General Georgios Hatzianestis , and five senior politicians were executed . Prince Andrew 's life was believed to be in danger , and Alice was under surveillance . In December , a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life . The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew 's family , with Philip carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box . Philip 's family went to France , where they settled in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud in a house lent to them by his wealthy aunt , Princess George of Greece and Denmark .   Because he left the country as a baby , he does not have a strong grasp of Greek . In 1992 , Philip said that he `` could understand a certain amount of '' the language .

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural , and military force in Europe . Both `` Byzantine Empire '' and `` Eastern Roman Empire '' are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire ( , tr . ; ) , or Romania ( ) , and to themselves as `` Romans '' .   Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West divided . Constantine I ( r. 324–337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital , and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379–395 ) , Christianity became the Empire 's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . Finally , under the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610–641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin . Thus , although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture , and characterised by Orthodox Christianity .   The borders of the Empire evolved significantly over its existence , as it went through several cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527–565 ) , the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy , and Rome itself , which it held for two more centuries . During the reign of Maurice ( r. 582–602 ) , the Empire 's eastern frontier was expanded and the north stabilised . However , his assassination caused the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 , which exhausted the Empire 's resources and contributed to major territorial losses during the Muslim conquests of the seventh century . In a matter of years the Empire lost its richest provinces , Egypt and Syria , to the Arabs .   During the Macedonian dynasty ( 10th–11th centuries ) , the Empire again expanded and experienced the two-century long Macedonian Renaissance , which came to an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . This battle opened the way for the Turks to settle in Anatolia as a homeland .   The Empire recovered again during the Komnenian restoration , such that by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city . However , it was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade , when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 and the territories that the Empire formerly governed were divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms . Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261 , the Byzantine Empire remained only one of several small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence . Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century . The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 finally ended the Byzantine Empire .   Nomenclature   The first use of the term `` Byzantine '' to label the later years of the Roman Empire was in 1557 , when the German historian Hieronymus Wolf published his work Corpus Historiæ Byzantinæ , a collection of historical sources . The term comes from `` Byzantium '' , the name of the city of Constantinople before it became Constantine 's capital . This older name of the city would rarely be used from this point onward except in historical or poetic contexts . The publication in 1648 of the Byzantine du Louvre ( Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae ) , and in 1680 of Du Cange 's Historia Byzantina further popularised the use of `` Byzantine '' among French authors , such as Montesquieu . However , it was not until the mid-19th century that the term came into general use in the Western world .   The Byzantine Empire was known to its inhabitants as the ``"], [30, "Carlos Alberto Martínez Tevez ( ; born 5 February 1984 ) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Boca Juniors and the Argentina national team . His energy , skill , and goal scoring rate have made him an indispensable player for his club sides throughout his career , in the eyes of fellow players and media alike .   Tevez began his career with Boca Juniors , winning the Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup in 2003 before moving to Corinthians where he won the Brasileiro . In 2006 he moved to West Ham United , helping the team remain in the Premier League in his only season . Tevez 's prolonged transfers to West Ham and Manchester United were plagued by issues regarding third-party ownership by Media Sports Investment , and their resulting sagas paved changes to both Premier League and FIFA regulations .   Tevez transferred to Manchester United in 2007 and in his two years won several trophies including two league titles and the Champions League . In 2009 he joined Manchester City for £47 million , becoming the first player to move between the two rival clubs since Terry Cooke in 1999 . Despite missing four months of the 2011–12 season following a dispute , Tevez returned to help City win their first league title in 44 years . In 2013 , he joined Juventus for £12 million , finishing as the team 's top goalscorer and winning the Scudetto in his first season . After winning a domestic double and reaching the Champions League final in his second season , he returned to Boca Juniors in June 2015 where he won another domestic double , becoming the first footballer to win two domestic league and cup doubles in one calendar year .   Since his debut for Argentina in 2005 , Tevez has over 75 caps . A gold medal winner at the 2004 Olympics , he also played at two World Cups , a Confederations Cup , and four Copa América tournaments .   Early life   Tevez was born Carlos Alberto Martínez in Ciudadela , Buenos Aires Province , and raised in the neighbourhood of Ejército de Los Andes , better known as `` Fuerte Apache '' . It was from there that he got the nickname of `` El Apache '' . His parents changed his surname to his mother 's during a conflict between his junior club All Boys and Boca Juniors .   Tevez has a distinctive burn scar that runs down his neck from his right ear to his chest . He was accidentally scalded with boiling water as a child , which caused third-degree burns and kept him hospitalised in intensive care for nearly two months . After joining Boca Juniors , Tevez refused an offer from the club to have them cosmetically improved , saying that the scars were a part of who he was in the past and who he is today .   Club career   Boca Juniors   Aged 16 , Tevez made his debut for Boca Juniors against Talleres de Córdoba in the during the Torneo Apertura of the 2001–02 Argentine Primera División , on 21 October 2001 . Boca Juniors were crowned champions of the 2001 Copa Libertadores and faced Bayern Munich at the 2001 Intercontinental Cup on 27 November , where they lost 1–0 , however Tevez was not included in the squad . He went on to score 1 goal in 11 league appearances in the 2001–02 season . Boca had finished in 1st place of their 2002 Copa Libertadores group and had reached the quarter-final stage , where they faced Paraguay 's Club Olimpia . Tevez scored after 18 minutes in the first-leg to give Boca Juniors a 1–0 lead , until Olimpia levelled the scores in the 67th minute when Boca defender Cristian Traverso scored an own goal , on 8 May . Boca lost the second-leg 1–0 in Asunción on 16 May . Boca finished three points behind Independiente to finish in second position during the Torneo Apertura . Boca Juniors eventually finished four points behind River Plate to claim second position in the Torneo Clausura .   Tevez scored 10 goals in 32 appearances for Boca during the 2002–03 season . During the 2002 Copa Sudamericana , Boca were eliminated 3–1 on aggregate by Gimnasia de La Plata in the first-round . Boca Juniors participated at the 2003 Copa Libertadores and reached the final of the competition , where they faced Santos . Boca won 5–1 on aggregate , with Tevez scoring in Boca 's 3–1 away win in the second-leg . Tevez was also voted as the tournament 's best player"], [31, "( , , or ; Greek : , from λέγω lego `` I say '' ) is an important term in western philosophy , psychology , rhetoric , and religion . It is a Greek word meaning `` a ground '' , `` a plea '' , `` an opinion '' , `` an expectation '' , `` word '' , `` speech '' , `` account '' , `` to reason '' , but it became a technical term in philosophy beginning with Heraclitus ( ca . 535–475 BC ) , who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge .   Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways . The sophists used the term to mean discourse , and Aristotle applied the term to refer to `` reasoned discourse '' or `` the argument '' in the field of rhetoric . The Stoic philosophers identified the term with the divine animating principle pervading the Universe . Under Hellenistic Judaism , Philo ( c. 20 BC – AD 50 ) adopted the term into Jewish philosophy . The Gospel of John identifies the Logos , through which all things are made , as divine ( theos ) , May , Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger . The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha . 1977. and further identifies Jesus Christ as the incarnate Logos . Although the term `` Logos '' is widely used in this Christian sense , in academic circles it often refers to the various ancient Greek uses , or to post-Christian uses within contemporary philosophy , Sufism , and the analytical psychology of Carl Jung .   Despite the conventional translation as `` word '' , it is not used for a word in the grammatical sense ; instead , the term lexis ( λέξις ) was used . However , both logos and lexis derive from the same verb legō ( λέγω ) , meaning `` to count , tell , say , speak '' .   Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a `` premise . '' She states that , to find the reason behind a rhetor 's backing of a certain position or stance , one must acknowledge the different `` premises '' that the rhetor applies via his or her chosen diction . She continues by stating that the rhetor 's success will come down to `` certain objects of agreement ... between arguer and audience . '' `` Logos is logical appeal , and the term logic is derived from it . It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker 's topic . '' Furthermore , logos is credited with appealing to the audience 's sense of logic , with the definition of “ logic ” being concerned with the thing as it is known .  Furthermore , you can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways : 1 ) through inductive logic , providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement ; 2 ) through deductive enthymeme , providing the audience with general scenarios and then pulling out a certain truth .   Philo distinguished between logos prophorikos ( `` the uttered word '' ) and the logos endiathetos ( `` the word remaining within '' ) . The Stoics also spoke of the logos spermatikos ( the generative principle of the Universe ) , which is not important in the Biblical tradition but is relevant in Neoplatonism . Early translators from Greek , such as Jerome in the 4th century , were frustrated by the inadequacy of any single Latin word to convey the Logos expressed in the Gospel of John . The Vulgate Bible usage of in principio erat verbum was thus constrained to use the ( perhaps inadequate ) noun verbum for `` word '' , but later romance language translations had the advantage of nouns such as le mot in French . Reformation translators took another approach . Martin Luther rejected Zeitwort ( verb ) in favor of Wort ( word ) , for instance , although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving the living word as felt by Jerome and Augustine .   Ancient Greek philosophy   Heraclitus   The writing of Heraclitus ( c. 535 – c. 475 BC ) was the first place where the word logos was given special attention in ancient Greek philosophy , although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time . For Heraclitus , logos provided the link between rational discourse and the world 's"], [32, "William Buckland DD FRS ( 12 March 1784 – 14 August 1856 ) was an English theologian who became Dean of Westminster . He was also a geologist and palaeontologist , writing the first full account of a fossil dinosaur , which he named Megalosaurus . His work proving that Kirkdale Cave had been a prehistoric hyena den , for which he was awarded the Copley Medal , was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct events from the distant past . He was a pioneer in the use of fossilised faeces , for which he coined the term coprolites , to reconstruct ancient ecosystems .   Buckland was a proponent of the Gap Theory that interpreted the biblical account of Genesis as referring to two separate episodes of creation separated by a lengthy period ; it emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a way to reconcile the scriptural account with discoveries in geology that suggested the earth was very old . Early in his career he believed that he had found geological evidence of the biblical flood , but later became convinced that the glaciation theory of Louis Agassiz provided a better explanation , and he played an important role in promoting that theory in Great Britain .   Early life and university   Buckland was born at Axminster in DevonChisholm , 1911 and , as a child , would accompany his father , the Rector of Templeton and Trusham , on his walks where interest in road improvements led to collecting fossil shells , including ammonites , from the Jurassic lias rocks exposed in local quarries .   He was educated first at Blundell 's School , Tiverton , Devon , and then at Winchester College , from where in 1801 he won a scholarship to study for the ministry at Corpus Christi College , Oxford , also attending the lectures of John Kidd on mineralogy and chemistry , as well as developing an interest in geology and carrying out field research on strata , during vacations . Having taken his BA in 1804 , he went on to obtain his MA degree in 1808 . He then became a Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1809 , was ordained as a priest and continued to make frequent geological excursions , on horseback , to various parts of England , Scotland , Ireland and Wales . In 1813 , he was appointed reader in mineralogy , in succession to John Kidd , giving lively and popular lectures with increasing emphasis on geology and palaeontology . As ( unofficial ) curator of the Ashmolean Museum , he built up collections , touring Europe and coming into contact with scientists including Georges Cuvier .   Rejection of flood geology and Kirkdale Cave   In 1818 , Buckland was elected a fellow of the Royal Society . That year he persuaded the Prince Regent to endow an additional Readership , this time in Geology and he became the first holder of the new appointment , delivering his inaugural address on 15 May 1819 . This was published in 1820 as Vindiciæ Geologiæ ; or the Connexion of Geology with Religion explained , both justifying the new science of geology and reconciling geological evidence with the biblical accounts of creation and Noah 's Flood . At a time when others were coming under the opposing influence of James Hutton 's theory of uniformitarianism , Buckland developed a new hypothesis that the word `` beginning '' in Genesis meant an undefined period between the origin of the earth and the creation of its current inhabitants , during which a long series of extinctions and successive creations of new kinds of plants and animals had occurred . Thus , his catastrophism theory incorporated a version of Old Earth creationism or Gap creationism . Buckland believed in a global deluge during the time of Noah but was not a supporter of flood geology as he believed that only a small amount of the strata could have been formed in the single year occupied by the deluge .   From his investigations of fossil bones at Kirkdale Cave , in Yorkshire , he concluded that the cave had actually been inhabited by hyaenas in antediluvian times , and that the fossils were the remains of these hyaenas and the animals they had eaten , rather than being remains of animals that had perished in the Flood and then carried from the tropics by the surging waters , as he and others had at first thought . In 1822 he wrote :   It must already appear probable , from the facts above described , particularly from the comminuted state and apparently gnawed"], [33, "The flag of Greece ( popularly referred to as the `` sky-blue-white '' or the `` blue-white '' and in Greek : `` Γαλανόλευκη '' or `` Κυανόλευκη '' ) , officially recognised by Greece as one of its national symbols , is based on nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white . There is a blue canton in the upper hoist-side corner bearing a white cross ; the cross symbolises Eastern Orthodox Christianity , the established religion of the Greek people of Greece and Cyprus . According to popular tradition , the nine stripes represent the nine syllables of the phrase `` Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος '' ( `` Freedom or Death '' ) , the five blue stripes for the syllables `` Έλευθερία '' and the four white stripes `` ή Θάνατος '' . The nine stripes are also said to represent the letters of the word `` freedom '' ( Greek : Ελευθερία ) . There is also a different theory , that the nine stripes symbolise the nine Muses , the goddesses of art and civilisation ( nine has traditionally been one of the numbers of reference for the Greeks ) . The official flag ratio is 2:3 . [ http : //www.presidency.gr/index.php ? option  com_content & viewarticle & id  3 & Itemid6 & lang  en The Flag , from the site of the Presidency of the Hellenic Republic ]   The blazon of the flag is Azure , four bars Argent ; on a canton of the field a Greek cross throughout of the second . The shade of blue used in the flag has varied throughout its history , from light blue to dark blue , the latter being increasingly used since the late 1960s .   The above patterns were officially adopted by the First National Assembly at Epidaurus on 13 January 1822 . Blue and white have many interpretations , symbolising the colours of the famed Greek sky and sea ( combined with the white clouds and waves ) , traditional colours of Greek clothes in the islands and the mainland , etc .   History   The origins of today 's national flag with its cross-and-stripe pattern are a matter of debate . Every part of it , including the blue and white colours ( see below ) , the cross , as well as the stripe arrangement can be connected to very old historical elements ; however it is difficult to establish `` continuity '' , especially as there is no record of the exact reasoning behind its official adoption in early 1822 .   It has been suggested by some Greek historians that the current flag derived from an older design , the virtually identical flag of the powerful Cretan Kallergis family . This flag was based on their coat of arms , whose pattern is supposed to be derived from the standards of their claimed ancestor , Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas ( 963–969 AD ) . This pattern ( according to not easily verifiable descriptions ) included nine stripes of alternating blue and white , as well as a cross , assumed to be placed on the upper left N.

However , in such cases of flags derived from much older designs , it is very difficult to prove or trace original influences .   Antiquity and the Byzantine Empire   Flags as they are known today did not exist in Antiquity . Instead , a variety of emblems and symbols ( semeion , pl . semeia ) were used to denote each state and were for example painted on the hoplite shields . The closest analogue to a modern flag were the vexillum-like banners used by ancient Greek armies , such as the so-called phoinikis , a cloth of deep red , suspended from the top of a staff or spear . It is not known to have carried any device or decoration though .   The Byzantines , like the Romans before them , used a variety of flags and banners , primarily to denote different military units . These were generally square or rectangular , with a number of streamers attached . Most prominent among the early Byzantine flags was the labarum"], [34, "Swimming is an individual or team sport and activity . Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports , with events in butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke , freestyle , and individual medley . In addition to these individual events , Olympic swimmers also participate in relays . Swimmers can also compete in open-water events ( i.e . swimming in the Ocean ) .   History   Evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has been found , with the earliest evidence dating to Stone Age paintings from around 10000 years ago . Written references date from 2000 BC , with some of the earliest references to swimming including the Iliad , the Odyssey , the Bible , Beowulf , the Quran and others . In 1538 , Nikolaus Wynmann , a German professor of languages , wrote the first swimming book , The Swimmer or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming ( Der Schwimmer oder ein Zweigespräch über die Schwimmkunst ) .   Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England . In 1828 , the first indoor swimming pool , St George 's Baths was opened to the public . By 1837 , the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools , built around London . The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880 , when the first national governing body , the Amateur Swimming Association , was formed , there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country .   In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming competition in London introduced the front crawl to a Western audience . Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from some South American natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873 , winning a local competition in England . His stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today .   Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel ( between England and France ) , in 1875 . Using the breaststroke technique , he swam the channel in 21 hours and 45 minutes . His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years , until T.W . Burgess made the crossing in 1911 .   Other European countries also established swimming federations ; Germany in 1882 , France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896 . The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna . The world 's first women 's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892 .   Men 's swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens . In 1902 , the Australian Richmond Cavill introduced the front crawl to the Western world . In 1908 , the world swimming association , Fédération Internationale de Natation ( FINA ) , was formed . Women 's swimming was introduced into the Olympics in 1912 . Butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was at first a variant of breaststroke , until it was accepted as a separate style in 1952 .   Competitive swimming   Competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century . The goal of competitive swimming is to break personal or world records while beating competitors in any given event . Swimming in competition should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed . However , some professional swimmers who do not hold a national or world ranking are considered the best in regard to their technical skills . Typically , an athlete goes through a cycle of training in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the cycle , and then the workload is decreased in the final stage as the swimmer approaches competition .   The practice of reducing exercise in the days just before an important competition is called tapering . A final stage is often referred to as `` shave and taper '' : the swimmer shaves off all exposed hair for the sake of reducing drag and having a sleeker and more hydrodynamic feel in the water . Additionally , the `` shave and taper '' method refers to the removal of the top layer of `` dead skin '' , which exposes the newer and richer skin underneath .   Swimming is an event at the Summer Olympic Games , where male and female athletes compete in 16 of the recognized events each . Olympic events are held in a 50-meter pool , called a long course pool .   There are forty officially recognized individual swimming events in the pool ; however the International Olympic Committee only"], [35, "The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author J. R. R. Tolkien . The story began as a sequel to Tolkien 's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit , but eventually developed into a much larger work . Written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written , with over 150 million copies sold .   The title of the novel refers to the story 's main antagonist , the Dark Lord Sauron , who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth . From quiet beginnings in the Shire , a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside , the story ranges across Middle-earth , following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters , not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins , Samwise `` Sam '' Gamgee , Meriadoc `` Merry '' Brandybuck and Peregrin `` Pippin '' Took , but also the hobbits ' chief allies and travelling companions : the Men Aragorn son of Arathorn , a Ranger of the North , and Boromir , a Captain of Gondor ; Gimli son of Glóin , a Dwarf warrior ; Legolas Greenleaf , an Elven prince ; and Gandalf , a Wizard .   The work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set , the other to be The Silmarillion , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher . For economic reasons The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 . The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers , and The Return of the King . Structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume . Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume . The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages .   Tolkien 's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins . Although a major work in itself , the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917 , in a process he described as mythopoeia . Influences on this earlier work , and on the story of The Lord of the Rings , include philology , mythology , religion and the author 's distaste for the effects of industrialization , as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien 's experiences in World War I . These inspirations and themes have often been denied by Tolkien himself . The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy ; the impact of Tolkien 's works is such that the use of the words `` Tolkienian '' and `` Tolkienesque '' have been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary .   The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture , the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien 's works , and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works . The Lord of the Rings has inspired , and continues to inspire , artwork , music , films and television , video games , and subsequent literature . Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio , theatre , and film . In 2003 , it was named Britain 's best-loved novel of all time in the BBC 's The Big Read .   Plot summary   Prologue   Thousands of years before the events of the novel , the Dark Lord Sauron had forged the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power and corrupt those who wore them : the leaders of Men , Elves and Dwarves . Sauron was later vanquished in battle by an alliance of Elves and Men led by Elendil and Gil-galad . Isildur , a ruler of Men , cut the One Ring from Sauron 's finger , claiming it as an heirloom for his line , and Sauron lost his physical form . When Isildur was later ambushed and killed by the Orcs , the Ring was lost in the River Anduin at Gladden Fields .   Over two thousand years later , the Ring was found by one of the river-folk called"], [36, "Troy ( , Troia and , Ilion , or , Ilios ; and ; Trōia is the typical Latin name for the city . Ilium is a more poetic term : Hittite : Wilusa or Truwisa ; ) was a city situated in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor , now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey , near ( just south of ) the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles straits and northwest of Mount Ida . The present-day location is known as Hisarlık . It was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle , in particular in the Iliad , one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer . Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey suggests that the name ( Ilion ) formerly began with a digamma : ( Wilion ) ; this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city , Wilusa .   A new capital called Ilium was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus . It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople and declined gradually in the Byzantine era .   In 1865 , English archaeologist Frank Calvert excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarlık , and in 1868 , Heinrich Schliemann , a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist , also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in Çanakkale . These excavations revealed several cities built in succession . Schliemann was at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy , but was persuaded by Calvert and took over Calvert 's excavations on the eastern half of the Hisarlik site , which was on Calvert 's property . Troy VII has been identified with the Hittite city Wilusa , the probable origin of the Greek Ἴλιον , and is generally ( but not conclusively ) identified with Homeric Troy .   Today , the hill at Hisarlık has given its name to a small village near the ruins , which supports the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site . It lies within the province of Çanakkale , some 30 km south-west of the provincial capital , also called Çanakkale . The nearest village is Tevfikiye . The map here shows the adapted Scamander estuary with Ilium a little way inland across the Homeric plain .   Troy was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998 .   Homeric Troy   Ancient Greek historians variously placed the Trojan War in the 12th , 13th , or 14th centuries BC : Eratosthenes to 1184 BC , Herodotus to 1250 BC , Duris of Samos to 1334 BC . Modern archaeologists associate Homeric Troy with archaeological Troy VII .   In the Iliad , the Achaeans set up their camp near the mouth of the River Scamander ( presumably modern Karamenderes ) , where they had beached their ships . The city of Troy itself stood on a hill , across the plain of Scamander , where the battles of the Trojan War took place . The site of the ancient city is some 5 km from the coast today , but 3,000 years ago the mouths of Scamander were much closer to the city , discharging into a large bay that formed a natural harbour and which has since been filled with alluvial material . Recent geological findings have permitted the identification of the ancient Trojan coastline , and the results largely confirm the accuracy of the Homeric geography of Troy .   In November 2001 , the geologist John C. Kraft from the University of Delaware and the classicist John V. Luce from Trinity College , Dublin , presented the results of investigations , begun in 1977 , into the geology of the region . They compared the present geology with the landscapes and coastal features described in the Iliad and other classical sources , notably Strabo 's Geographia , and concluded that there is a regular consistency between the location of Schliemann 's Troy and other locations such as the Greek camp , the geological evidence , descriptions of the topography and accounts of the battle in the Iliad .   Besides the Iliad , there are references to Troy in the other major work attributed to Homer , the Odyssey , as well as in other ancient Greek literature ( such as Aeschylus ' Oresteia ) . The Homeric legend of Troy was elaborated by the Roman poet Virgil in his Aeneid . The Greeks and Romans took for a fact the historicity of the Trojan War and the"], [37, "Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks , concerning their gods and heroes , the nature of the world , and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices . It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece . Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization , and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself .   Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives , and implicitly in Greek representational arts , such as vase-paintings and votive gifts . Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world , and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods , goddesses , heroes , heroines and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature .  The oldest known Greek literary sources , Homer 's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias .   Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology , with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes .   Sources   Greek mythology is known today primarily from Greek literature and representations on visual media dating from the Geometric period from c. 900–800 BC onward . In fact , literary and archaeological sources integrate , sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict ; however , in many cases , the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots .   Literary sources   Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature . Nevertheless , the only general mythographical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity was the Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus . This work attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets and provides a grand summary of traditional Greek mythology and heroic legends . Apollodorus of Athens lived from c. 180–125 BC and wrote on many of these topics . His writings may have formed the basis for the collection ; however the `` Library '' discusses events that occurred long after his death , hence the name Pseudo-Apollodorus .   Among the earliest literary sources are Homer 's two epic poems , the Iliad and the Odyssey . Other poets completed the `` epic cycle '' , but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely . Despite their traditional name , the `` Homeric Hymns '' have no direct connection with Homer . They are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so-called Lyric age . Hesiod , a possible contemporary with Homer , offers in his Theogony ( Origin of the Gods ) the fullest account of the earliest Greek myths , dealing with the creation of the world ; the origin of the gods , Titans , and Giants ; as well as elaborate genealogies , folktales , and etiological myths . Hesiod 's Works and Days , a didactic poem about farming life , also includes the myths of Prometheus , Pandora , and the Five Ages . The poet gives advice on the best way to succeed in a dangerous world , rendered"], [38, "The cuisine of South Africa can be generalised as :   * Cookery practised by indigenous people of Africa such as the Sotho- and Nguni-speaking people .  * Cookery that emerged from several waves of colonisation and immigration introduced during the colonial period by white European people of Dutch ( since 1652 ) , German , French , Italian , Greek and British ( since 1805~1820 ) descent and their Indo-Asian slaves or servants – this includes the cuisine of the so-called Cape Malay people , which has many characteristics of Indonesia and cooking styles from neighbouring colonial cultures such as Portuguese Mozambique .   Indigenous cookery   In the precolonial period , indigenous cuisine was characterised by the use of a very wide range of foods including fruits , nuts , bulbs , leaves and other products gathered from wild plants and by the hunting of wild game . The introduction of domestic cattle and grain crops by Bantu speakers who arrived in the southern regions from central Africa since 10,000 BC and the spread of cattle keeping to Khoisan groups enabled products and the availability of fresh meat on demand . The pre-colonial diet consisted primarily of cooked grains , especially sorghum , fermented milk ( somewhat like yogurt ) and roasted or stewed meat . At some point , maize replaced sorghum as the primary grain , and there is some dispute as to whether maize , a Central American crop , arrived with European settlers ( notably the Portuguese ) or spread through Africa before white settlement via Africans returning from the Americas during the era of the slave trade . People also kept sheep and goats , and communities often organised vast hunts for the abundant game ; but beef was considered the absolutely most important and high status meat . The ribs of any cattle that were slaughtered in many communities were so prized that they were offered to the chief of the village .   In many ways , the daily food of South African families can be traced to the indigenous foods that their ancestors ate . A typical meal in a South African family household that is Bantu-speaking is a stiff , fluffy porridge of maize meal ( called `` pap , '' and very similar to American grits ) with a flavourful stewed meat gravy . Traditional rural families ( and many urban ones ) often ferment their pap for a few days – especially if it is sorghum instead of maize – which gives it a tangy flavor . The Sotho-Tswana call this fermented pap , `` ting . ''   The vegetable is often some sort of pumpkin , varieties of which are indigenous to South Africa , although now many people eat pumpkins that originated in other countries . Rice and beans are also very popular even though they are not indigenous . Another common vegetable dish , which arrived in South Africa with its many Irish immigrants , but which has been adopted by South Africans , is shredded cabbage and white potatoes cooked with butter .   For many South Africans meat is the centre of any meal . The Khoisan ate roasted meat , and they also dried meat for later use . The influence of their diet is reflected in the common Southern African love of barbecue ( generally called in South Africa by its Afrikaans name , a `` braai '' ) and biltong ( dried preserved meat ) . As in the past , when men kept cattle as their prized possession in the rural areas , South Africans have a preference for beef . Today , South Africans enjoy not only beef , but mutton , goat , chicken and other meats as a centrepiece of a meal . On weekends , many South African families have a `` braai , '' and the meal usually consists of `` pap and vleis '' , which is maize meal and grilled meat . Eating meat even has a ritual significance in both traditional and modern South African culture . In Bantu culture , for weddings , initiations , the arrival of family members after a long trip and other special occasions , families will buy a live animal and slaughter it at home , and then prepare a large meal for the community or neighbourhood . Participants often say that spilling the blood of the animal on the ground pleases the ancestors who invisibly gather around the carcass . On holiday weekends , entrepreneurs will set up pens of live animals along the main roads of townships—mostly sheep and goats—for families to purchase , slaughter , cook and eat . Beef being the most"], [39, "Springfield is a city in western New England , and the seat of Hampden County , Massachusetts , in the United States . Springfield sits on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River near its confluence with three rivers : the western Westfield River , the eastern Chicopee River , and the eastern Mill River . As of the 2010 Census , the city 's population was 153,060 . Metropolitan Springfield , as one of two metropolitan areas in Massachusetts ( the other being Greater Boston ) , had an estimated population of 698,903 as of 2009 .   The first Springfield in the New World , it is the largest city in Western New England , and the urban , economic , and cultural capital of Massachusetts ' Connecticut River Valley ( colloquially known as the Pioneer Valley ) . It is the third-largest city in Massachusetts and fourth-largest in New England , after Boston , Worcester , and Providence . Springfield has several nicknames – The City of Firsts , because of its many innovations ( see below for a partial list ) ; The City of Homes , due to its Victorian residential architecture ; and Hoop City , as basketball – one of the world 's most popular sports – was invented in Springfield by James Naismith .   Hartford , the capital of Connecticut , lies south of Springfield , on the western bank of the Connecticut River . Bradley International Airport , which sits 12 mi south of Metro Center Springfield , is Hartford-Springfield 's airport . The Hartford-Springfield region is known as the Knowledge Corridor because it hosts over 160,000 university students and over 32 universities and liberal arts colleges – the second-highest concentration of higher-learning institutions in the United States . The city of Springfield itself is home to Springfield College ; Western New England University ; American International College ; and Springfield Technical Community College , among other higher educational institutions .   History   Springfield was founded in 1636 by English Puritan William Pynchon as `` Agawam Plantation '' under the administration of the Connecticut Colony . In 1641 it was renamed after Pynchon 's hometown of Springfield , Essex , England , following incidents that precipitated the settlement joining the Massachusetts Bay Colony . During its early existence , Springfield flourished as both an agricultural settlement and trading post , although its prosperity waned dramatically during ( and after ) King Philip 's War in 1675 , when natives laid siege to it and burned it to the ground .   The original settlement – today 's downtown Springfield – was located atop bluffs at the confluence of four rivers , at the nexus of trade routes to Boston , Albany , New York City , and Montreal , and with some of the northeastern United States ' most fertile soil . In 1777 , Springfield 's location at numerous crossroads led George Washington and Henry Knox to establish the United States ' National Armory at Springfield , which produced the first American musket in 1794 , and later the famous Springfield rifle . From 1777 until its closing during the Vietnam War , the Springfield Armory attracted skilled laborers to Springfield , making it the United States ' longtime center for precision manufacturing . The near-capture of the U.S. Arsenal at Springfield during Shays Rebellion of 1787 led directly to the formation of the U.S . Constitutional Convention .   During the 19th and 20th centuries , Springfielders produced many innovations , including the first American-English dictionary ( 1805 , Merriam Webster ) ; the first use of interchangeable parts and the assembly line in manufacturing , ( 1819 , Thomas Blanchard ; ) the first American horseless car , ( 1825 , Thomas Blanchard ; ) the discovery and patent of vulcanized rubber , ( 1844 , Charles Goodyear ; ) the first American gasoline-powered car , ( 1893 , Duryea Brothers ) ; the first successful motorcycle company , ( 1901 , `` Indian '' ) ; one of America 's first commercial radio stations , ( 1921 , WBZ , broadcast from the Hotel Kimball ) ; and most famously , the world 's second-most-popular sport , basketball , ( 1891 , Dr. James Naismith ) .   Springfield underwent a protracted decline during the second half of the 20th century , due largely to the decommission of the Springfield Armory in 1969 ; poor city planning decisions , such as the location of the elevated I-91 along the city 's Connecticut Riverfront ; and overall decline of industry throughout the northeastern U.S. During the 1980s and 1990s , Springfield developed a national reputation for crime , political"], [40, "The Argentine Navy or Navy of the Argentine Republic or Armada of the Argentine Republic ( — ARA , also Armada Argentina ) is the navy of Argentina . It is one of the three branches of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic , together with the Army and the Air Force . Each ship of the Argentine Navy is designated with the prefix `` ARA '' before its name .   The Argentine Navy day is celebrated on May 17 , anniversary of the victory achieved in 1814 in the Battle of Montevideo over the Spanish fleet during the war of Independence .   History   19th century   The Argentine Navy was created in the aftermath of the May Revolution of May 25 , 1810 , which started the war for independence from Spain . The navy was first created to support Manuel Belgrano in the Paraguay campaign , but it was sunk by ships from Montevideo , and did not take part in that conflict . Renewed conflicts with Montevideo led to the creation of a second fleet , which participated in the capture of the city . As Buenos Aires had little maritime history , most men in the navy were from other nations , such as the Irish-born admiral William Brown , who directed the operation . As the cost of maintaining a navy was too high , most of the Argentine naval forces were composed of privateers .   Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata .   In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself . At the close of the century , the force included :   * 5 armoured cruisers  * 4 coastal defence ironclads  * 3 second-class , high-speed , British-built cruisers  * 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats  * 4 destroyers and  * 22 torpedo boats .   The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships : , , and , each at over 6,000 tons . Three older ironclads , , , and dated from the 1880s and early 1890s .   The navy 's ships were built primarily in Italy , Britain , France , and Spain and were operated by over 600 officers and 7760 seamen . These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery .   20th century   Argentina remained neutral in both world wars . In 1940 , Argentina 's navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world ( after the European powers , Japan , and the United States ) and the largest in Latin America . A ten-year building programme costing $ 60 million had produced a force of 14,500 sailors and over a thousand officers . The fleet included two First World War-era ( but modernized ) American-built s , three modern cruisers , a dozen British-built destroyers , and three submarines in addition to minelayers , minesweepers , coastal defence ships , and gunboats . A naval air force was also in operation .   In the postwar period , Naval Aviation and Marine Corps units were put under direct Navy command . With Brazil , Argentina is one of two South American countries to have operated two aircraft carriers : the and .   The Argentine Navy has been traditionally heavily involved in fishery inspection helping the Coast Guard : most notably in 1966 a destroyer fired on and holed a Soviet trawler that had refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata , in the 1970s there were four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships and continued in recent years .   The Navy also took part in all military coups through the 20th century . During the last dictatorship , Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War of the late 1970s in which thousands of people were kidnapped , tortured and killed by the forces of the Military Junta . The Naval Mechanics School , known as ESMA , was a notorious centre for torture . Among their more well-known victims were the Swedish teenager Dagmar Hagelin and French nuns , Alice Domon and Léonie Duquet ( In October 2007 the Argentine Navy formally handed possession of the school to human rights groups to turn into a memorial museum ) . During this regime , the Navy was also the main supporter of a military solution for the country 's two longest standing disputes : the Beagle Conflict with Chile and the Falkland Islands ( ) with the United Kingdom .   Falklands"], [41, "An introduced , alien , exotic , non-indigenous , or non-native species , or simply an introduction , is a species living outside its native distributional range , which has arrived there by human activity , either deliberate or accidental . Non-native species can have various effects on the local ecosystem . Introduced species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction are called invasive species . Some have a negative effect on a local ecosystem . Some introduced species may have no negative effect or only minor impact . Some species have been introduced intentionally to combat pests . They are called biocontrols and may be regarded as beneficial as an alternative to pesticides in agriculture for example . In some instances the potential for being beneficial or detrimental in the long run remains unknown . A list of some introduced species is given in a separate article .   The effects of introduced species on natural environments have gained much scrutiny from scientists , governments , farmers and others .   Terminology   The terminology associated with introduced species is now in flux for various reasons . Other terms with somewhat similar meanings ) with introduced are acclimatized , adventive , naturalized , and immigrant but those terms refer to a subset of introduced species : those that have become established and can reproduce without human assistance . The term invasive refers only to those species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction . For practical purposes , this term is applied only to invasive species that cause damage .   In the broadest and most widely used sense , an introduced species is synonymous with non-native and therefore applies as well to most garden and farm organisms ; these adequately fit the basic definition given above . However , some sources add to that basic definition `` and are now reproducing in the wild , '' Carlton , James T. 2002 . Introduced Species in U.S. Coastal Waters . Pew Oceans Commission . which removes from consideration as introduced all of those species raised or grown in gardens or farms that do not survive without tending by people . With respect to plants , these latter are in this case defined as either ornamental or cultivated plants .   The following definition from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , although perhaps lacking ecological sophistication , is more typical : introduced species `` A species that has been intentionally or inadvertently brought into a region or area . Also called an exotic or non-native species . '' Introduction of a species outside its native range is all that is required to be qualified as an `` introduced species '' such that one can distinguish between introduced species that may not occur except in cultivation , under domestication or captivity whereas others become established outside their native range and reproduce without human assistance . Such species might be termed `` naturalized '' , `` established '' , `` wild non-native species '' . If they further spread beyond the place of introduction they are called `` invasive '' . The transition from introduction , to establishment and to invasion has been described in the context of plants . Introduced species are essentially `` non-native '' species . Invasive species are those introduced species that spreadwidely or quickly and cause harm , be that to the environment , human health , other valued resources or the economy . There have been calls from scientists to consider a species `` invasive '' only in terms of their spread and reproduction rather than the harm they may cause .   According to a practical definition , an invasive species is one that has been introduced and become a pest in its new location , spreading ( invading ) by natural means . The term is used to imply both a sense of urgency and actual or potential harm . For example , U.S. Executive Order 13112 ( 1999 ) defines `` invasive species '' as `` an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health '' . The biological definition of invasive species , on the other hand , makes no reference to the harm they may cause , only to the fact that they spread beyond the area of original introduction .   Although some argue that `` invasive '' is a loaded word and harm is difficult to define , the fact of the matter is that organisms have and continue to be introduced to areas in which they are not native , sometimes with but usually without much regard to the harm"], [42, "George Smiley is a fictional character created by John le Carré . Smiley is an intelligence officer working for `` The Circus '' , the British overseas intelligence agency . He is a central character in the novels Call for the Dead , A Murder of Quality , Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy , The Honourable Schoolboy , and Smiley 's People , and a supporting character in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold , The Looking Glass War and The Secret Pilgrim .   Early life   Although Smiley has no concrete biography beyond that offered briefly at the beginning of Call for the Dead , le Carré does leave clues in his novels .   Smiley was probably born around 1906 ( or 1915 on the revised chronology ) to middle class parents in the South of England , and attended a minor public school and an antiquated Oxford college of no real distinction ( in the 1982 BBC television adaptation of Smiley 's People , he refers to himself as a fellow of Lincoln College ) , studying modern languages with a particular focus on Baroque German literature . In July 1928 , while considering post-graduate study in that field , he was recruited into the Circus by his tutor Jebedee .   He underwent training and probation in Central Europe and South America , and spent the period from 1935 until approximately 1938 in Germany recruiting networks under cover as a lecturer . In 1939 , with the commencement of World War II , he saw active service not only in Germany , but also in Switzerland and Sweden . Smiley 's wartime superiors described him as having `` the cunning of Satan and the conscience of a virgin '' .   In 1943 , he was recalled to England to work at Circus headquarters , and in 1945 successfully proposed marriage to Lady Ann Sercomb , a beautiful , aristocratic , and libidinous young lady working as a secretary there . Ann would prove a most unfaithful and rather condescending wife . In the same year , Smiley left the Service and returned to Oxford . However , in 1947 , with the onset of the Cold War , Smiley was asked to return to the Service , and in early 1951 moved into counter-intelligence work , where he would remain for the next decade . During that period , Smiley first met his Soviet nemesis , Karla , in a Delhi prison . Karla proved impossible to crack , taking Smiley 's lighter for good measure , a gift to Smiley from wife Ann .   In the novels   The early novels   Smiley first appeared in Call for the Dead , le Carré 's debut novel . At the start of the novel , set around 1960 , Smiley has fallen from grace and is working in a relatively menial intelligence job , including security-clearing civil servants . He spends much of the story bemoaning the loss of the talented agents who were his mentors and their replacement by such talentless civil-service bureaucrats as the current head of service , Maston , who refers to himself as the `` Ministers ' Adviser on Intelligence '' and is widely , if secretly , mocked . Over the course of the story , Smiley resigns from the Circus in anger on the spur of the moment while unravelling an East German spy ring , clearing his own name in so doing , and restoring his reputation while remaining in retirement at tale 's end , despite Maston 's pleadings . It is while pursuing a sedate life of scholastic research in German literature at a university in the West Country ( probably Exeter ) that he is called upon to investigate a murder at a fictional public school in le Carré 's next novel , A Murder of Quality .   Le Carré was propelled to international renown by The Spy Who Came in from the Cold , his third novel . Smiley , a minor but pivotal character in the story , still retired , but revealed during the story to be back in the Circus as one of the top aides to `` Control '' , Maston 's mysterious successor as the Circus ' chief . Smiley and his assistant Peter Guillam have actually turned the brutal head of East German intelligence into a British double agent . The events in this book take place around 1962 , after the construction of the Berlin Wall .   Smiley appears again in The Looking Glass War , le Carré 's fourth novel , though only in a peripheral role , occupying the"], [43, "A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft , as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft , whose main mission is to attack ground targets . The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed , maneuverability , and small size relative to other combat aircraft .   Many fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities , and some are designed as dual-purpose fighter-bombers ; often aircraft that do not fulfill the standard definition are called fighters . This may be for political or national security reasons , for advertising purposes , or other reasons .   A fighter 's main purpose is to establish air superiority over a battlefield . Since World War I , achieving and maintaining air superiority has been considered essential for victory in conventional warfare . The success or failure of a belligerent 's efforts to gain air supremacy hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots , the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters , and the numbers and performance of those fighters . Because of the importance of air superiority , since the dawn of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers , and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces .   Terminology   The word `` fighter '' did not become the official English-language term for such aircraft until after World War I . In the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force these aircraft were referred to as `` scouts '' into the early 1920s . The U.S. Army called their fighters `` pursuit '' aircraft from 1916 until the late 1940s . In most languages a fighter aircraft is known as a hunter , or hunting aircraft ( avion de chasse , jagdflugzeuge , avión de caza etc . ) . Exceptions include Russian , where a fighter is an `` истребитель '' ( pronounced `` istrebitel '' ) , meaning `` exterminator '' , and Hebrew where it is `` matose krav '' ( literally `` battle plane '' ) .   As a part of military nomenclature , a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use , along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft . The letters used to designate a fighter differ in various countries — in the English-speaking world , `` F '' is now used to indicate a fighter ( e.g . F-35 or Spitfire F.22 ) , though when the pursuit designation was used in the US , they were `` P '' types ( e.g . P-40 ) . In Russia `` I '' was used ( I-16 ) , while the French continue to use `` C '' ( Nieuport 17 C.1 ) .   Although the term `` fighter '' specifies aircraft designed to shoot down other aircraft , such designs are often also useful as multirole fighter-bombers , strike fighters , and sometimes lighter , fighter-sized tactical ground-attack aircraft . This has always been the case , for instance the Sopwith Camel and other `` fighting scouts '' of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work . In World War II , the USAAF and RAF often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or dive bombers , and types such as the P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Hurricane that were no longer competitive aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack . Several aircraft , such as the F-111 and F-117 , have received fighter designations but had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons . The F-111B variant was originally intended for a fighter role with the U.S. Navy , but it was cancelled . This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for `` attack '' or `` strike '' operations against ground targets by means of strafing or dropping small bombs and incendiaries . Versatile multirole fighter-bombers such as the F/A-18 Hornet are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types .   Some of the most expensive fighters such as the US F-14 Tomcat , F-15 Eagle , F-22 Raptor and Russian Su-27 were employed as all-weather interceptors as well as air superiority fighter aircraft , while commonly developing air-to-ground roles late in their careers . An interceptor is generally an aircraft intended to target ( or intercept ) bombers and so often trades maneuverability for climb rate .   Development overview   Fighters were developed in World War I to deny enemy aircraft and dirigibles the ability to gather information by reconnaissance ."], [44, "The Open Championship , often referred to as The Open or the British Open , is the oldest of the four major championships in professional golf . Held in the United Kingdom , it is administered by The R & A and is the only major outside the United States . The Open is currently the third major of the year , between the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship , and is played in mid-July .   The current champion is Henrik Stenson , who won the 145th Open at Royal Troon in 2016 with a record-breaking score of −20 .   History   The Open was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland . The inaugural tournament was restricted to professionals and attracted a field of eight golfers who played three rounds of Prestwick 's twelve-hole course in a single day . Willie Park Sr. won with a score of 174 , beating Old Tom Morris , by two strokes . The following year the tournament was opened to amateurs ; eight of them joined ten professionals in the field .   James Ogilvie Fairlie was the principal organiser of the first Open Championship held at Prestwick in 1860 . With the untimely death of Allan Robertson , aged 43 in 1859 , Prestwick members decided to conduct a challenge the following year that would determine the land ’ s greatest golfer . In a proposed competition for a `` Challenge Belt '' , Fairlie sent out a series of letters to Blackheath , Perth , Edinburgh , Musselburgh and St Andrews , inviting a player known as a `` respectable caddie '' to represent each of the clubs in a tournament to be held on 17 October 1860 .   Originally , the trophy presented to the event 's winner was the Challenge Belt , a red leather belt with a silver buckle . The Challenge Belt was retired in 1870 , when Young Tom Morris was allowed to keep it for winning the tournament three consecutive times . Because no trophy was available , the tournament was cancelled in 1871 . In 1872 , after Young Tom Morris won again for a fourth time in a row , he was awarded a medal . The present trophy , The Golf Champion Trophy , better known by its popular name of the Claret Jug , was then created .   Prestwick administered The Open from 1860 to 1870 . In 1871 , it agreed to organise it jointly with The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers . In 1892 the event was doubled in length from 36 to 72 holes , four rounds of what was by then the standard complement of 18 holes . The 1894 Open was the first held outside Scotland , at the Royal St George 's Golf Club in England . Because of an increasing number of entrants , a cut was introduced after two rounds in 1898 . In 1920 full responsibility for The Open Championship was handed over to The Royal & Ancient Golf Club .   The early winners were all Scottish professionals , who in those days worked as greenkeepers , clubmakers , and caddies to supplement their modest winnings from championships and challenge matches . The Open has always been dominated by professionals , with only six victories by amateurs , all of which occurred between 1890 and 1930 . The last of these was Bobby Jones ' third Open and part of his celebrated Grand Slam . Jones was one of six Americans who won The Open between the First and Second World Wars , the first of whom had been Walter Hagen in 1922 . These Americans and the French winner of the 1907 Open , Arnaud Massy , were the only winners from outside Scotland and England up to 1939 .   The first post-World War II winner was the American Sam Snead , in 1946 . In 1947 , Northern Ireland 's Fred Daly was victorious . While there have been many English and Scottish champions , Daly was the only winner from Ireland until the 2007 victory by Pádraig Harrington . There has never been a Welsh champion . In the early postwar years The Open was dominated by golfers from the Commonwealth , with South African Bobby Locke and Australian Peter Thomson winning the Claret Jug in eight of the 11 championships from 1948 and 1958 between them . During this period , The Open often had a schedule conflict with the match-play PGA Championship , which meant that Ben Hogan , the best American golfer at this time"], [45, "Anthony Charles Lynton Blair ( born 6 May 1953 ) is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007 and the Leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007 . Together with then-US President George W. Bush , he initiated the Iraq War with the invasion of Iraq , an act which remains highly controversial .   From 1983 to 2007 , Blair was the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994 , following the sudden death of his predecessor , John Smith . Under Blair 's leadership , the party used the phrase `` New Labour '' , to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism . Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as `` social-ism '' , involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent , and advocated social justice , cohesion , equal worth of each citizen , and equal opportunity . Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism .   In May 1997 , the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory , the largest in its history , allowing Blair , at 43 years old , to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812 . In September 1997 , Blair attained early personal popularity , receiving a 93 % public approval rating , after his public response to the death of Diana , Princess of Wales . The Labour Party went on to win two more elections under his leadership : in 2001 , in which it won another landslide victory , and in 2005 , with a reduced majority . In the first years of the New Labour government , Blair 's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act , Human Rights Act , and Freedom of Information Act . Blair 's government also carried out the devolution , the establishing of the Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales , and the Northern Ireland Assembly , thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto . In Northern Ireland , Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement .   Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration , and ensured that British Armed Forces participated in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and , more controversially , the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Blair has faced strong criticism for his role in the invasion of Iraq , including calls for having him tried for war crimes and waging a war of aggression . In 2016 the Iraq Inquiry strongly criticised his actions and described the invasion of Iraq as unjustified and unnecessary .   Blair was succeeded as the leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007 , and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown . On the day that Blair resigned as Prime Minister , he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East , which he held until 27 May 2015 . He now runs a consultancy business and has set up various foundations in his own name , including the Tony Blair Faith Foundation .   Early life   Blair was born in Edinburgh , Scotland , on 6 May 1953 , the second son of Leo and Hazel ( Corscadden ) Blair . Leo Blair , the illegitimate son of two English actors , had been adopted as a baby by Glasgow shipyard worker James Blair and his wife , Mary . Hazel Corscadden was the daughter of George Corscadden , a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to ( and later died in ) Ballyshannon , County Donegal in 1923 , where his wife , Sarah Margaret ( née Lipsett ) , gave birth to Blair 's mother , Hazel , above the family 's grocery shop .   Blair has one elder brother , Sir William Blair , a High Court judge , and a younger sister , Sarah . Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh . During this period , his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the University of Edinburgh .   In the 1950s , his family spent three and a half years in Adelaide , South Australia , where his father was a lecturer in law at the University of Adelaide . The Blairs lived close to the university , in the suburb of Dulwich . The family returned"], [46, "A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative , often serialized , with text in balloons and captions . Traditionally , throughout the 20th century and into the 21st , these have been published in newspapers and magazines , with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers , while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections . With the development of the internet , they began to appear online as web comics .   There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century , for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes .   Strips are written and drawn by a comics artist or cartoonist . As the name implies , comic strips can be humorous ( for example , `` gag-a-day '' strips such as Blondie , Bringing Up Father , Marmaduke , and Pearls Before Swine ) .   Starting in the late 1920s , comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories , as seen in Popeye , Captain Easy , Buck Rogers , Tarzan , and The Adventures of Tintin . Soap-opera continuity strips such as Judge Parker and Mary Worth gained popularity in the 1940s . All are called , generically , comic strips , though cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that `` sequential art '' would be a better genre-neutral name .   In the UK and the rest of Europe , comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines , with a strip 's story sometimes continuing over three pages or more . Comic strips have appeared in American magazines such as Liberty and Boys ' Life and also on the front covers of magazines , such as the Flossy Frills series on The American Weekly Sunday newspaper supplement .   History   Storytelling using a sequence of pictures has existed through history . One medieval European example in textile form is the Bayeux Tapestry . Printed examples emerged in 19th-century Germany and in 18th-century England , where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced . William Hogarth 's 18th century English cartoons include both narrative sequences , such as A Rake 's Progress , and single panels .   The Biblia pauperum ( `` Paupers ' Bible '' ) , a tradition of picture Bibles beginning in the later Middle Ages , sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the miniatures written on scrolls coming out of their mouths—which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips .   In China , with its traditions of block printing and of the incorporation of text with image , experiments with what became lianhuanhua date back to 1884 .   Newspapers   The first newspaper comic strips appeared in North America in the late 19th century . The Yellow Kid is usually credited as the first . However , the art form combining words and pictures developed gradually and there are many examples which led up to the comic strip .   Swiss author and caricature artist Rodolphe Töpffer ( Geneva , 1799–1846 ) is considered the father of the modern comic strips . His illustrated stories such as Histoire de M. Vieux Bois ( 1827 ) , first published in the USA in 1842 as The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck or Histoire de Monsieur Jabot ( 1831 ) , inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists . In 1865 , German painter , author , and caricaturist Wilhelm Busch created the strip Max and Moritz , about two trouble-making boys , which had a direct influence on the American comic strip . Max and Moritz was a series of severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children 's stories such as Struwwelpeter ( `` Shockheaded Peter '' ) ; in one , the boys , after perpetrating some mischief , are tossed into a sack of grain , run through a mill , and consumed by a flock of geese . Max and Moritz provided an inspiration for German immigrant Rudolph Dirks , who created the Katzenjammer Kids in 1897 . Familiar comic-strip iconography such as stars for pain , sawing logs for snoring , speech balloons , and thought balloons originated in Dirks ' strip .   Hugely popular , Katzenjammer Kids occasioned one of the first comic-strip copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium . When Dirks left William Randolph Hearst for the promise of a better salary under Joseph Pulitzer , it was an unusual move"], [47, "Georgia ( ; , tr . Sakartvelo , ) is a country in the Caucasus region of Eurasia . Located at the crossroads of Western Asia and Eastern Europe , it is bounded to the west by the Black Sea , to the north by Russia , to the south by Turkey and Armenia , and to the southeast by Azerbaijan . The capital and largest city is Tbilisi . Georgia covers a territory of 69700 km² , and its 2015 population is about 3.75 million . Georgia is a unitary , semi-presidential republic , with the government elected through a representative democracy .   During the classical era , several independent kingdoms became established in what is now Georgia . The kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia adopted Christianity in the early 4th century . A unified Kingdom of Georgia reached the peak of its political and economic strength during the reign of King David IV and Queen Tamar in the 11th–12th centuries . Thereafter the area was dominated by various large empires for centuries , including the Mongols , the Ottoman Empire , and successive dynasties of Iran . In the late 18th century , the kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti forged an alliance with the Russian Empire , and the area was annexed by Russia in 1801 . The latter 's rule over Georgia was confirmed in 1813 through the Treaty of Gulistan with Qajar Iran . Following the Russian Revolution in 1917 , Georgia obtained independence , though only briefly , and established its first-ever republic under German and British protection , only to be invaded by Soviet Russia in 1921 and subsequently absorbed into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic .   After restoring its independence once again in 1991 , post-communist Georgia suffered from civil and economic crisis for most of the 1990s . This lasted until the peaceful Rose Revolution , when Georgia pursued a strongly pro-Western foreign policy , introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at NATO and European integration . The country 's Western orientation soon led to the worsening of relations with Russia , culminating in the brief Russo-Georgian War .   Georgia is a member of the Council of Europe and the GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development . It contains two de facto independent regions , Abkhazia and South Ossetia , which gained limited international recognition after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War . Georgia and a major part of the international community consider the regions to be part of Georgia 's sovereign territory under Russian military occupation .   Etymology   `` Georgia '' probably stems from the Persian designation of the Georgians – gurğān , in the 11th and 12th centuries adapted via Syriac gurz-ān/gurz-iyān and Arabic ĵurĵan/ĵurzan . Lore based theories were given by he traveller Jacques de Vitry , who explained the name 's origin by the popularity of St. George amongst Georgians , while traveller Jean Chardin thought that `` Georgia '' came from Greek γεωργός ( `` tiller of the land '' ) . As Prof. Alexander Mikaberidze adds , these century-old explanations for the word Georgia/Georgians are rejected by the scholarly community , who point to the Persian word gurğ/gurğān ( `` wolf '' ) as the root of the word . Starting with the Persian word gurğ/gurğān , the word was later adopted in numerous other languages , including Slavic and West European languages . This term itself might have been established through the ancient Iranian appellation of the near-Caspian region , which was referred to as Gorgan ( `` land of the wolves '' ) .   The native name is Sakartvelo ( საქართველო ; `` land of Kartvelians '' ) , derived from the core central Georgian region of Kartli , recorded from the 9th century , and in extended usage referring to the entire medieval Kingdom of Georgia by the 13th century . The self-designation used by ethnic Georgians is Kartvelebi ( ქართველები , i.e . `` Kartvelians '' )   The medieval Georgian Chronicles present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians , Kartlos , a great-grandson of Japheth . However , scholars agree that the word is derived from the Karts , the latter being one of the proto-Georgian tribes that emerged as a dominant group in ancient times . The name Sakartvelo ( საქართველო ) consists of two parts . Its root , kartvel-i ( ქართველ-ი ) , specifies an inhabitant of the core central-eastern Georgian region of Kartli , or Iberia as it is known in sources of the Eastern Roman Empire . Ancient Greeks ( Strabo , Herodotus , Plutarch , Homer , etc . ) and Romans ( Titus Livius , Tacitus ,"], [48, "The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area , variously classed as the world 's largest lake or a full-fledged sea . It is in an endorheic basin ( it has no outflows ) located between Europe and Asia . It is bounded to the northeast by Kazakhstan , to the northwest by Russia , to the west by Azerbaijan , to the south by Iran , and to the southeast by Turkmenistan .   The Caspian Sea lies to the east of the Caucasus Mountains and to the west of the vast steppe of Central Asia . Its northern part , the Caspian Depression , is one of the lowest points on Earth . The ancient inhabitants of its coast perceived the Caspian Sea as an ocean , probably because of its saltiness and large size .   The sea has a surface area of ( not including its detached lagoon of Garabogazköl Aylagy ) and a volume of . It has a salinity of approximately 1.2 % ( 12 g/l ) , about a third of the salinity of most seawater .   Etymology   The word Caspian is derived from the name of the Caspi , an ancient people who lived to the southwest of the sea in Transcaucasia . Strabo wrote that `` to the country of the Albanians belongs also the territory called Caspiane , which was named after the Caspian tribe , as was also the sea ; but the tribe has now disappeared '' . Moreover , the Caspian Gates , which is the name of a region in Iran 's Tehran province , possibly indicates that they migrated to the south of the sea . The Iranian city of Qazvin shares the root of its name with that of the sea . In fact , the traditional Arabic name for the sea itself is Bahr al-Qazwin ( Sea of Qazvin ) .   In classical antiquity among Greeks and Persians it was called the Hyrcanian Ocean . In Persian antiquity , as well as in modern Iran , it is known as the , Daryā-e Khazar ; it is also sometimes referred to as Mazandaran Sea ( ) in Iran . Ancient Arabic sources refer to it as Baḥr Gīlān ( بحر گیلان ) meaning `` the Gilan Sea '' .   Turkic languages refer to the lake as Khazar Sea . In Turkmen , the name is , in Azeri , it is , and in modern Turkish , it is . In all these cases , the second word simply means `` sea '' , and the first word refers to the historical Khazars who had a large empire based to the north of the Caspian Sea between the 7th and 10th centuries . An exception is Kazakh , where it is called , Kaspiy teñizi ( Caspian Sea ) .   Old Russian sources call it the Khvalyn or Khvalis Sea ( Хвалынское море / Хвалисское море ) after the name of Khwarezmia . In modern Russian , it is called , Kaspiyskoye more .   Physical characteristics   Formation   The Caspian Sea , like the Aral Sea , Black Sea , and Lake Urmia , is a remnant of the ancient Paratethys Sea . It became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago due to tectonic uplift and a fall in sea level . During warm and dry climatic periods , the landlocked sea almost dried up , depositing evaporitic sediments like halite that were covered by wind-blown deposits and were sealed off as an evaporite sink when cool , wet climates refilled the basin . ( Comparable evaporite beds underlie the Mediterranean . ) Due to the current inflow of fresh water , the Caspian Sea is a freshwater lake in its northern portions . It is more saline on the Iranian shore , where the catchment basin contributes little flow . Currently , the mean salinity of the Caspian is one third that of Earth 's oceans . The Garabogazköl embayment , which dried up when water flow from the main body of the Caspian was blocked in the 1980s but has since been restored , routinely exceeds oceanic salinity by a factor of 10 .   Geography   The Caspian Sea is the largest inland body of water in the world and accounts for 40 to 44 % of the total lacustrine waters of the world . The coastlines of the Caspian are shared by Azerbaijan , Iran , Kazakhstan , Russia , and Turkmenistan . The Caspian is divided into three distinct physical regions : the Northern , Middle , and Southern Caspian . The"], [49, "Dundee ( ; ) , officially the City of Dundee , is Scotland 's fourth largest city and the 51st most populous built-up area in the United Kingdom . At the 2011 census , Dundee had a population density of 8,541.8/sq mi ( 3,298.0/km2 ) , the second highest of any Scottish city . The mid-year population estimate for 2014 is 148,260 . It lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay , which feeds into the North Sea . Under the name of Dundee City , it forms one of the 32 council areas used for local government in Scotland .   Historically part of Angus , the city developed into a burgh in medieval times , and expanded rapidly in the 19th century largely due to the jute industry . This , along with its other major industries gave Dundee its epithet as city of `` jute , jam and journalism '' . Dundee 's recorded population reached a peak of 182,204 at the 1971 census .   Today , Dundee is promoted as 'One City , Many Discoveries ' in honour of Dundee 's history of scientific activities and of the RRS Discovery , Robert Falcon Scott 's Antarctic exploration vessel , which was built in Dundee and is now berthed in the city harbour . Biomedical and technological industries have arrived since the 1980s , and the city now accounts for 10 % of the United Kingdom 's digital-entertainment industry . Dundee has two universities—the University of Dundee and the Abertay University . In 2014 Dundee was recognised by the United Nations as the UK 's first UNESCO City of Design for its diverse contributions to fields including medical research , comics and video games .   A unique feature of Dundee is that its two professional football clubs have stadiums all but adjacent to each other .   A £1 billion master plan to regenerate and to reconnect the Waterfront to the city centre which started in 2001 is expected to be completed within a 30-year period , with the Dundee Victoria & Albert Museum opening by 2018 at a cost of £80 million .   History   The name `` Dundee '' is made up of two parts : the common Celtic place-name element dun , meaning fort ; and a second part that may derive from a Celtic element , cognate with the Gaelic dè , meaning 'fire ' .   While earlier evidence for human occupation is abundant , Dundee 's success and growth as a seaport town arguably came as a result of William the Lion 's charter , granting Dundee to his younger brother , David ( later Earl of Huntingdon ) in the late 12th century . The situation of the town and its promotion by Earl David as a trading centre led to a period of prosperity and growth . The earldom was passed down to David 's descendants , amongst whom was John Balliol . The town became a Royal Burgh on John 's coronation as king in 1292 . The town and its castle were occupied by English forces for several years during the First War of Independence and recaptured by Robert the Bruce in early 1312 . The original Burghal charters were lost during the occupation and subsequently renewed by Bruce in 1327 .   The burgh suffered considerably during the conflict known as the Rough Wooing of 1543 to 1550 , and was occupied by the English forces of Andrew Dudley from 1547 . In 1548 , unable to defend the town against an advancing Scottish force , Dudley ordered that the town be burnt to the ground . In 1645 , during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms , Dundee was again besieged , this time by the Royalist Marquess of Montrose . The town was finally destroyed by Parliamentarian forces led by George Monck in 1651 . The town played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Jacobite cause when John Graham of Claverhouse , 1st Viscount Dundee raised the Stuart standard on the Dundee Law in 1689 . The town was held by the Jacobites in the 1715–16 rising , and on 6 January 1716 the Jacobite claimant to the throne , James VIII and III ( the Old Pretender ) , made a public entry into the town . Many in Scotland , including many in Dundee , regarded him as the rightful king .   The economy of mediaeval Dundee centred on the export of raw wool , with the production of finished textiles being a reaction to recession in the 15th century .

West Africa has been defined as including the 18 countries Benin , Burkina Faso , the island of Cape Verde , Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , the island of Saint Helena , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Sao Tome and Principe and Togo .   History   The history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods : first , its prehistory , in which the first human settlers arrived , developed agriculture , and made contact with peoples to the north ; the second , the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-African , and extra-African trade , and developed centralized states ; third , major polities flourished , which would undergo an extensive history of contact with non-Africans ; fourth , the colonial period , in which Great Britain and France controlled nearly the whole of the region ; and fifth , the post-independence era , in which the current nations were formed .   Prehistory   Early human settlers from northern Holocene societies arrived in West Africa around 12,000 B.C . Sedentary farming began in , or around the fifth millennium B.C , as well as the domestication of cattle . By 1500 B.C , ironworking technology allowed an expansion of agricultural productivity , and the first city-states later formed . Northern tribes developed walled settlements and non-walled settlements that numbered at 400 . In the forest region , Iron Age cultures began to flourish , and an inter-region trade began to appear . The desertification of the Sahara and the climatic change of the coast cause trade with upper Mediterranean peoples to be seen .   The domestication of the camel allowed the development of a trans-Saharan trade with cultures across the Sahara , including Carthage and the Berbers ; major exports included gold , cotton cloth , metal ornaments and leather goods , which were then exchanged for salt , horses , textiles , and other such materials . Local leather , cloth , and gold also contributed to the abundance of prosperity for many of the following empires .   Empires   The development of the region 's economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form , beginning with the Nok culture that began in 1000 B.C . and the Ghana Empire that first flourished between the 1st and 3rd centuries , which later gave way to the Mali Empire . In current-day Mauritania , there exist archaeological sites in the towns of Tichit and Oualata that were initially constructed around 2000 B.C. , and were found to have originated from the Soninke branch of the Mandé peoples . Also , based on the archaeology of city of Kumbi Saleh in modern-day Mauritania , the Mali empire came to dominate much of the region until its defeat by Almoravid invaders in 1052 .   The Sosso Empire sought to fill the void , but was defeated ( c. 1240 ) by the Mandinka forces of Sundiata Keita , founder of the new Mali Empire . The Mali Empire continued to flourish for several centuries , most particularly under Sundiata 's grandnephew Musa I , before a succession of weak rulers led to its collapse under Mossi , Tuareg and Songhai invaders . In the 15th century , the Songhai would form a new dominant state based on Gao , in the Songhai Empire , under the leadership of Sonni Ali and Askia Mohammed .   Meanwhile , south of the Sudan , strong city states arose in Igboland , such as the 10th-century Kingdom of Nri , which helped birth the arts and customs of the Igbo people , Bono in the 12th century , which eventually culminated in the formation the all-powerful Akan Empire of Ashanti , while Ife and Benin City rose to prominence around the 14th century . Further east , Oyo arose as the dominant Yoruba state and the Aro Confederacy as a dominant Igbo state in modern-day Nigeria .   Slavery and European contact   Portuguese traders began establishing settlements along the coast in 1445 , followed by the French , English Spanish Danish and Dutch ; the African slave trade began not long after , which over the following centuries would debilitate the region 's economy and population . The slave trade also encouraged the formation of states such as the Asante Empire , Bambara Empire and Dahomey , whose economic activities include but not limited to exchanging slaves for European firearms .   Colonialism   In"], [51, "Anne , Princess Royal , ( Anne Elizabeth Alice Louise ; born 15 August 1950 ) is the second child and only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh . At the time of her birth , she was third in the line of succession , behind her mother and elder brother Charles . She rose to second after her mother 's accession , but is currently 12th in line .   Princess Anne is the seventh holder of the title Princess Royal . She is known for her charitable work , and is patron of over 200 organizations . She is also known for equestrian talents ; she won two silver medals ( 1975 ) and one gold medal ( 1971 ) at the European Eventing Championships , and is the first member of the British Royal Family to have competed in the Olympic Games .   Anne was married to Captain Mark Phillips in 1973 ; they divorced in 1992 . They have two children and three grandchildren . In 1992 , within months of her divorce , Anne married Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence , whom she had met while he served as her mother 's equerry between 1986 and 1989 .   Early life and education   Anne was born at Clarence House on 15 August 1950 at 11:50 am , as the second child and only daughter of Princess Elizabeth , Duchess of Edinburgh , and Philip , Duke of Edinburgh . She was the second grandchild of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth . Anne was baptised in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace on 21 October 1950 , by Archbishop of York , Cyril Garbett . Her godparents were the Queen—later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother ( her maternal grandmother ) ; the Princess Margarita , Hereditary Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg ( her paternal aunt ) ; Princess Alice of Greece and Denmark ( her paternal grandmother ) ; Earl Mountbatten of Burma ( her paternal great-uncle ) ; and Rev the Hon Andrew Elphinstone ( her first cousin once removed ) .   By letters patent of Anne 's great-grandfather , George V , the titles of a British prince or princess , and the style Royal Highness , were to be conferred only on children and male-line grandchildren of the sovereign , as well as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales . However , on 22 October 1948 , Anne 's grandfather issued new letters patent granting these honours to any children of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip ; in this way , the children of the heir presumptive had a royal and princely status . Otherwise , Anne would have been titled by courtesy at birth as Lady Anne Mountbatten .   A governess , Catherine Peebles , was appointed to look after the Princess and was responsible for her early education at Buckingham Palace ; Peebles also served as early governess for Anne 's older brother , Charles . After the death of George VI and the ascension to the throne of Anne 's mother Elizabeth , Anne became titled Her Royal Highness The Princess Anne . Given her young age at the time , she did not attend her mother 's coronation .   A Girl Guides company , the 1st Buckingham Palace Company to include the Holy Trinity Brompton Brownie pack , was reformed in May 1959 , specifically so that , as her mother and aunt had done as children , Anne could socialise with girls her own age . The Company was active until 1963 , when Anne went to boarding school . Anne enrolled at Benenden School in 1963 . In 1968 she graduated with six GCE O-Levels and two A-Levels .   In the next couple of years , Anne started dating . In 1970 her first boyfriend was Andrew Parker Bowles , who later became the first husband of Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall .   First marriage   On Wednesday , 14 November 1973 ( the twenty-fifth birthday of her brother , Prince Charles ) , Princess Anne married Mark Phillips , a lieutenant in the 1st Queen 's Dragoon Guards , at Westminster Abbey in a ceremony that was televised around the world , with an estimated audience of 100 million . Following the wedding , Anne and her husband lived at Gatcombe Park . He was made acting captain by the start of 1974 when he was appointed a personal aide-de-camp to Queen Elizabeth II . By 1989 , however , the Princess Royal and Mark Phillips announced their intention to separate , as the marriage had been under"], [52, "Desmond Mpilo Tutu , CH ( born 7 October 1931 ) is a South African social rights activist and retired Anglican bishop who rose to worldwide fame during the 1980s as an opponent of apartheid .   He was the first black Archbishop of Cape Town and bishop of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa ( now the Anglican Church of Southern Africa ) .   Tutu 's admirers see him as a great man who , since the demise of apartheid , has been active in the defence of human rights and uses his high profile to campaign for the oppressed . He has campaigned to fight HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis , poverty , racism , sexism , homophobia and transphobia . He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 ; the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism in 1986 ; the Pacem in Terris Award in 1987 ; the Sydney Peace Prize in 1999 ; the Gandhi Peace Prize in 2007 ; and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 . He has also compiled several books of his speeches and sayings .   Early life   Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born in Klerksdorp , Transvaal , the second of four children of Zacheriah Zililo Tutu and his wife , Aletta Tutu , and the only son . Tutu 's family moved to Johannesburg when he was twelve . His father was a teacher and his mother was a cleaner and cook at a school for the blind . Here he met Trevor Huddleston , who was a parish priest in the black slum of Sophiatown . `` One day , '' said Tutu , `` I was standing in the street with my mother when a white man in a priest 's clothing walked past . As he passed us he took off his hat to my mother . I could n't believe my eyes—a white man who greeted a black working class woman ! ''   Although Tutu wanted to become a doctor , his family could not afford the training , and he followed his father 's footsteps into teaching . Tutu studied at the Pretoria Bantu Normal College from 1951 to 1953 , and went on to teach at Johannesburg Bantu High School and at Munsienville High School in Mogale City . However , he resigned following the passage of the Bantu Education Act , in protest of the poor educational prospects for black South Africans . He continued his studies , this time in theology , at St Peter 's Theological College in Rosettenville , Johannesburg , and in December 1961 was ordained as an Anglican priest following in the footsteps of his mentor and fellow activist , Trevor Huddleston .   Tutu then travelled to King 's College London , ( 1962–1966 ) , where he received his bachelor 's and master 's degrees in theology . During this time he worked as a part-time curate , first at St Alban 's Church , Golders Green , and then at St Mary 's Church in Bletchingley , Surrey . He later returned to South Africa and became chaplain at the University of Fort Hare in 1967 . From 1970 to 1972 , Tutu lectured at the National University of Lesotho .   In 1972 , Tutu returned to the UK , where he was appointed vice-director of the Theological Education Fund of the World Council of Churches , at Bromley in Kent . He returned to South Africa in 1975 and was appointed Dean of St Mary 's Cathedral in Johannesburg .   Personal life   On 2 July 1955 , Tutu married Nomalizo Leah Shenxane , a teacher whom he had met while at college . They had four children : Trevor Thamsanqa Tutu , Theresa Thandeka Tutu , Naomi Nontombi Tutu and Mpho Andrea Tutu , all of whom attended the Waterford Kamhlaba School in Swaziland .   In 1975 he moved into what is now known as Tutu House on Soweto 's well known Vilakazi Street which is also the location of the late Nelson Mandela 's previous house . He and his family were still living there in 2005 . It is said to be one of the few streets in the world where two Nobel Prize winners have lived .   His son , Trevor Tutu , was arrested in 1989 at East London Airport for falsely claiming there had been a bomb on board a South African Airways ' plane . He was convicted in 1991 of contravening the Civil Aviation Act . The bomb threat delayed the Johannesburg-bound flight for more than three hours , costing South African Airways some R28000 . At the"], [53, "In musical terminology , tempo ( `` time '' in Italian ; plural : tempi ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof , how fast or slow . Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute , with the beats being a division of the measures , though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication . Tempo may be separated from articulation , or articulation may be indicated along with tempo , and tempo contributes to the overall texture . While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill , tempo is changeable , and often indicated by a conductor or drummer . While practicing , an electronic or mechanical device , a metronome , may indicate the tempo , as one usually works one 's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo .   Measuring tempo   A piece of music 's tempo is typically written at the start of the score , and in modern Western music is usually indicated in beats per minute ( bpm ) . This means that a particular note value ( for example , a quarter note , or crotchet ) is specified as the beat , and that the amount of time between successive beats is a specified fraction of a minute . The greater the number of beats per minute , the smaller the amount of time between successive beats , and thus faster a piece must be played . For example , a tempo of 60 beats per minute signifies one beat per second , while a tempo of 120 beats per minute is twice as rapid , signifying one beat every 0.5 seconds . Mathematical tempo markings of this kind became increasingly popular during the first half of the 19th century , after the metronome had been invented by Johann Nepomuk Maelzel , although early metronomes were somewhat inconsistent . Beethoven was one of the first composers to use the metronome ; in the 1810s he published metronomic indications for the eight symphonies he had composed up to that time.Some of these markings are today contentious , such as those on his `` Hammerklavier '' Sonata and Ninth Symphony , seeming to many to be almost impossibly fast , as is also the case for many of the works of Schumann . See `` metronome '' entry in Apel ( 1969 ) , p. 523 .   With the advent of modern electronics , bpm became an extremely precise measure . Music sequencers use the bpm system to denote tempo .   Instead of beats per minute , some 20th-century composers ( e.g. , Béla Bartók , Alberto Ginastera , and John Cage ) specify the total playing time for a piece , from which the performer can derive tempo .   Tempo is as crucial in contemporary music as it is in classical . In electronic dance music , accurate knowledge of a tune 's bpm is important to DJs for the purposes of beatmatching .   Musical vocabulary for tempo   Some musical pieces do not have a mathematical time indication . In classical music it is customary to describe the tempo of a piece by one or more words . Most of these words are Italian , because many of the most important composers of the 17th century were Italian , and this period was when tempo indications were first used extensively and codified .   Before the metronome , it was difficult to specify the tempo of a composition ; attempts were made using pendulums or the human pulse . Yet , after the metronome 's invention , musicians continued to use these words , often additionally indicating the mood of the piece . This blurred the traditional distinction between tempo and mood indicators . For example , presto and allegro both indicate a speedy execution ( presto being faster ) , but allegro also connotes joy ( from its original meaning in Italian ) . Presto , on the other hand , simply indicates speed . Additional Italian words also indicate tempo and mood . For example , the `` agitato '' in the Allegro agitato of the last movement of George Gershwin 's piano concerto in F has both a tempo indication ( undoubtedly faster than a usual Allegro ) and a mood indication ( `` agitated '' ) .   Understood tempo   In some cases ( quite often up to the end of the Baroque period ) , the conventions that governed musical composition were so strong that composers"], [54, "Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions . It is one of the plastic arts . Durable sculptural processes originally used carving ( the removal of material ) and modelling ( the addition of material , as clay ) , in stone , metal , ceramics , wood and other materials but , since Modernism , there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process . A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving , assembled by welding or modelling , or molded , or cast .   Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials , and often represents the majority of the surviving works ( other than pottery ) from ancient cultures , though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely . However , most ancient sculpture was brightly painted , and this has been lost .   Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures , and until recent centuries large sculptures , too expensive for private individuals to create , were usually an expression of religion or politics . Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean , India and China , as well as many in South America and Africa .   The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece , and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period . During the Middle Ages , Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith . The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo 's David . Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body , with the making of constructed sculpture , and the presentation of found objects as finished art works .   Types of sculpture   A basic distinction is between sculpture in the round , free-standing sculpture , such as statues , not attached ( except possibly at the base ) to any other surface , and the various types of relief , which are at least partly attached to a background surface . Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or bas-relief , high relief , and sometimes an intermediate mid-relief . Sunk-relief is a technique restricted to ancient Egypt . Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large figure groups and narrative subjects , which are difficult to accomplish in the round , and is the typical technique used both for architectural sculpture , which is attached to buildings , and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects , as in much pottery , metalwork and jewellery . Relief sculpture may also decorate steles , upright slabs , usually of stone , often also containing inscriptions .   Another basic distinction is between subtractive carving techniques , which remove material from an existing block or lump , for example of stone or wood , and modelling techniques which shape or build up the work from the material . Techniques such as casting , stamping and moulding use an intermediate matrix containing the design to produce the work ; many of these allow the production of several copies .   The term `` sculpture '' is often used mainly to describe large works , which are sometimes called monumental sculpture , meaning either or both of sculpture that is large , or that is attached to a building . But the term properly covers many types of small works in three dimensions using the same techniques , including coins and medals , hardstone carvings , a term for small carvings in stone that can take detailed work .   The very large or `` colossal '' statue has had an enduring appeal since antiquity ; the largest on record at 128 m is the 2002 Chinese Spring Temple Buddha . Another grand form of portrait sculpture is the equestrian statue of a rider on horse , which has become rare in recent decades . The smallest forms of life-size portrait sculpture are the `` head '' , showing just that , or the bust , a representation of a person from the chest up . Small forms of sculpture include the figurine , normally a statue that is no more than 18 in tall , and for reliefs the plaquette , medal or coin .   Modern and contemporary art have added a number of non-traditional forms of sculpture , including sound sculpture , light sculpture , environmental art , environmental sculpture , street art sculpture , kinetic sculpture ( involving aspects"], [55, "Mary of Teck ( Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes ; 26 May 1867 – 24 March 1953 ) was Queen consort of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions , and Empress consort of India , as the wife of King-Emperor George V .   Although technically a princess of Teck , in the Kingdom of Württemberg , she was born and raised in England . Her parents were Francis , Duke of Teck , who was of German extraction , and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge , a granddaughter of King George III . She was informally known as `` May '' , after her birth month . At the age of 24 she was betrothed to Prince Albert Victor , Duke of Clarence and Avondale , the eldest son of the Prince of Wales , but six weeks after the announcement of the engagement he died unexpectedly of pneumonia . The following year she became engaged to Albert Victor 's next surviving brother , George , who subsequently became King . Before her husband 's accession she was successively Duchess of York , Duchess of Cornwall and York and Princess of Wales .   As queen consort from 1910 , she supported her husband through the First World War , his ill health and major political changes arising from the aftermath of the war and the rise of socialism and nationalism . After George 's death in 1936 , she became queen mother when her eldest son , Edward , ascended the throne , but to her dismay he abdicated later the same year in order to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson . She supported her second son , Albert , who succeeded to the throne as George VI , until his death in 1952 . She died the following year , during the reign of her granddaughter Queen Elizabeth II , who had not yet been crowned .   Early life   Princess Victoria Mary ( `` May '' ) of Teck was born on 26 May 1867 at Kensington Palace , London . Her father was Prince Francis , Duke of Teck , the son of Duke Alexander of Württemberg by his morganatic wife , Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde . Her mother was Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge , the third child and younger daughter of Prince Adolphus , Duke of Cambridge , and Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel . She was baptised in the Chapel Royal of Kensington Palace on 27 July 1867 by Charles Thomas Longley , Archbishop of Canterbury , and her three godparents were Queen Victoria , the Prince of Wales ( later King Edward VII and May 's future father-in-law ) , and Princess Augusta , the Duchess of Cambridge . Before she became Queen , she was known to her family , friends and the public by the diminutive name of `` May '' , after her birth month .   May 's upbringing was `` merry but fairly strict '' .Pope-Hennessy , p. 66 She was the eldest of four children , the only girl , and `` learned to exercise her native discretion , firmness and tact '' by resolving her three younger brothers ' petty boyhood squabbles . They played with their cousins , the children of the Prince of Wales , who were similar in age . May was educated at home by her mother and governess ( as were her brothers until they were sent to boarding schools ) . The Duchess of Teck spent an unusually long time with her children for a lady of her time and class , and enlisted May in various charitable endeavours , which included visiting the tenements of the poor .   Although her mother was a grandchild of King George III , May was only a minor member of the British Royal Family . Her father , the Duke of Teck , had no inheritance or wealth , and carried the lower royal style of Serene Highness because his parents ' marriage was morganatic . However , the Duchess of Teck was granted a parliamentary annuity of £5,000 , and received about £4,000 a year from her mother , the Duchess of Cambridge . Despite this , the family was deeply in debt and lived abroad from 1883 , in order to economise . The Tecks travelled throughout Europe , visiting their various relations . They stayed in Florence , Italy , for a time , where May enjoyed visiting the art galleries , churches , and museums .   In 1885 , the Tecks returned to London , and took up residence at White Lodge , in Richmond Park . May was close to her"], [56, "An embryo is a multicellular diploid eukaryote in an early stage of embryogenesis , or development . In general , in organisms that reproduce sexually , an embryo develops from a zygote , the single cell resulting from the fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell . The zygote possesses half the DNA of each of its two parents . In plants , animals , and some protists , the zygote will begin to divide by mitosis to produce a multicellular organism . The result of this process is an embryo .   In humans , a pregnancy is generally considered to be in the embryonic stage of development between the fifth and the eleventh weeks after fertilization , and is considered a fetus from the twelfth week on .   Etymology   First attested in English in the mid-14c. , the word embryon derives from Medieval Latin embryo , itself from Greek ( embruon ) , lit . `` young one '' , which is the neuter of ( embruos ) , lit . `` growing in '' , from ἐν ( en ) , `` in '' and βρύω ( bruō ) , `` swell , be full '' ; the proper Latinized form of the Greek term would be embryum .   Development   In animals , the development of the zygote into an embryo proceeds through specific recognizable stages of blastula , gastrula , and organogenesis . The blastula stage typically features a fluid-filled cavity , the blastocoel , surrounded by a sphere or sheet of cells , also called blastomeres . In a placental mammal , an ovum is fertilized in a fallopian tube through which it travels into the uterus . An embryo is called a fetus at a more advanced stage of development and up until birth or hatching . In humans , this is from the eleventh week of gestation . However , animals which develop in eggs outside the mother 's body , are usually referred to as embryos throughout development ; e.g . one would refer to a chick embryo , not a `` chick fetus , '' even at later stages .   During gastrulation the cells of the blastula undergo coordinated processes of cell division , invasion , and/or migration to form two ( diploblastic ) or three ( triploblastic ) tissue layers . In triploblastic organisms , the three germ layers are called endoderm , ectoderm , and mesoderm . The position and arrangement of the germ layers are highly species-specific , however , depending on the type of embryo produced . In vertebrates , a special population of embryonic cells called the neural crest has been proposed as a `` fourth germ layer '' , and is thought to have been an important novelty in the evolution of head structures .   During organogenesis , molecular and cellular interactions between germ layers , combined with the cells ' developmental potential , or competence to respond , prompt the further differentiation of organ-specific cell types . For example , in neurogenesis , a subpopulation of ectoderm cells is set aside to become the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral nerves . Modern developmental biology is extensively probing the molecular basis for every type of organogenesis , including angiogenesis ( formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones ) , chondrogenesis ( cartilage ) , myogenesis ( muscle ) , osteogenesis ( bone ) , and many others .   Generally , if a structure pre-dates another structure in evolutionary terms , then it often appears earlier than the second in an embryo ; this general observation is sometimes summarized by the phrase `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' . For example , the backbone is a common structure among all vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , and mammals , and the backbone also appears as one of the earliest structures laid out in all vertebrate embryos . The cerebrum in humans , which is the most sophisticated part of the brain , develops last . This sequencing rule is not absolute , but it is recognized as being partly applicable to development of the human embryo .   Plant embryos   In botany , a seed plant embryo is part of a seed , consisting of precursor tissues for the leaves , stem ( see hypocotyl ) , and root ( see radicle ) , as well as one or more cotyledons . Once the embryo begins to germinate — grow out from the seed — it is called a seedling ( plantlet ) .   Bryophytes and ferns also produce an embryo , but do not produce seeds .

In 1928 the Baird Television Development Company achieved the first transatlantic television transmission . Baird 's early technological successes and his role in the practical introduction of broadcast television for home entertainment have earned him a prominent place in television 's history .   Baird was ranked number 44 in the BBC 's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote in 2002 . In 2006 , Baird was named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history , having been listed in the National Library of Scotland 's 'Scottish Science Hall of Fame ' . In 2015 he was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame .   Early years   Baird was born on 14 August 1888 in Helensburgh , Dunbartonshire , and was the youngest of four children of the Reverend John Baird , the Church of Scotland 's minister for the local St Bride 's Church and Jessie Morrison Inglis , the orphaned niece of a wealthy family of shipbuilders from Glasgow .   He was educated at Larchfield Academy ( now part of Lomond School ) in Helensburgh ; the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College ; and the University of Glasgow . While at college Baird undertook a series of engineering apprentice jobs as part of his course . The conditions in industrial Glasgow at the time helped form his socialist convictions but also contributed to his ill health . His degree course was interrupted by the First World War and he never returned to graduate . At the beginning of 1915 he volunteered for service in the British Army but was classified as unfit for active duty . Unable to go to the Front , he took a job with the Clyde Valley Electrical Power Company , which was engaged in munitions work .   Television experiments   The development of television was the result of work by many inventors . Among them , Baird was a prominent pioneer and made major advances in the field . Many historians credit Baird with being the first to produce a live , moving , greyscale television image from reflected light . Baird achieved this , where other inventors had failed , by obtaining a better photoelectric cell and improving the signal conditioning from the photocell and the video amplifier .   Between 1902 and 1907 , Arthur Korn invented and built the first successful signal-conditioning circuits for image transmission . The circuits overcame the image-destroying lag effect that is part of selenium photocells . Korn 's compensation circuit allowed him to send still fax pictures by telephone or wireless between countries and even over oceans , while his circuit operated without benefit of electronic amplification . Korn 's success at transmitting halftone still images suggested that such compensation circuits might work in television . Baird was the direct beneficiary of Korn 's research and success .   In his first attempts to develop a working television system , Baird experimented with the Nipkow disk . Paul Gottlieb Nipkow had invented this scanning disc system in 1884.Albert Abramson , The History of Television , 1880 to 1941 , McFarland , 1987 , pp . 13–15 . Television historian Albert Abramson calls Nipkow 's patent `` the master television patent '' . Nipkow 's work is important because Baird and many others chose to develop it into a broadcast medium .   In early 1923 , and in poor health , Baird moved to 21 Linton Crescent , Hastings , on the south coast of England . He later rented a workshop in the Queen 's Arcade in the town . Baird built what was to become the world 's first working television set using items including an old hatbox and a pair of scissors , some darning needles , a few bicycle light lenses , a used tea chest , and sealing wax and glue that he purchased . In February 1924 , he demonstrated to the Radio Times that a semi-mechanical analogue television system was possible by transmitting moving silhouette images . In July of the same year , he received a 1000-volt electric shock , but survived with only a burnt hand , and as a result his landlord , Mr Tree , asked him to vacate the premises . Baird gave the first"], [58, "Octopussy ( 1983 ) is the thirteenth entry in the Eon Productions James Bond film series , and the sixth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond .   The film 's title is taken from a short story in Ian Fleming 's 1966 short story collection Octopussy and The Living Daylights , although the film 's plot is original . It does , however , include a scene inspired by the Fleming short story `` The Property of a Lady '' ( included in 1967 and later editions of Octopussy and The Living Daylights ) , while the events of the short story `` Octopussy '' form a part of the title character 's background and are recounted by her .   Bond is assigned the task of following a general who is stealing jewels and relics from the Soviet government . This leads him to a wealthy Afghan prince , Kamal Khan , and his associate , Octopussy . Bond uncovers a plot to force disarmament in Europe with the use of a nuclear weapon .   Octopussy was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson , and was released in the same year as the non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again . The film was written by George MacDonald Fraser , Richard Maibaum , and Michael G. Wilson , and was directed by John Glen .   Plot   British agent 009 is found dead at the British embassy in East Berlin , dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Fabergé egg . MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and , after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London , sends James Bond to investigate and find out the identity of the seller . At the auction , Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan , forcing Khan to pay £500,000 for the fake egg . Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan , India , where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon . Bond escapes with his Indian colleague Vijay , evading Khan 's bodyguard Gobinda 's attempts to kill them both . Bond is seduced by one of Khan 's associates , Magda , and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo . Bond permits Magda to steal the real Fabergé egg fitted with a listening device by Q , while Gobinda captures Bond and takes him to Khan 's palace . After Bond escapes from his cell he listens in on the bug in the Fabergé egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov , a Soviet general , who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe .   After escaping from Khan 's palace , Bond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur , India , and there finds its owner , Octopussy , a wealthy business woman and smuggler and an associate of Khan . She also leads the Octopus cult , of which Magda is a member . In Octopussy 's palace , Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures , replacing them with replicas while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West via Octopussy 's circus troupe . Orlov is planning to meet Khan at Karl-Marx-Stadt ( Chemnitz ) in East Germany , where the circus is scheduled to perform . After evading Khan 's assassins , who killed Vijay , Bond goes to East Germany .   Bond infiltrates the circus and finds that Orlov replaced the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead , primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany . The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament in the belief that the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident , leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion .

( sometimes informally known as Millionaire ) is an international television game show franchise of British origin , created by David Briggs , Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight . In its format , currently owned and licensed by Sony Pictures Television , large cash prizes are offered for correctly answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing ( or , in some cases , random ) difficulty . The maximum cash prize ( in the original British version ) was one million pounds . Most international versions offer a top prize of one million units of the local currency ; the actual value of the prize varies widely , depending on the value of the currency .   The original British version of the show debuted on 4 September 1998 , and aired on ITV with Chris Tarrant as its host until 11 February 2014. International variants have aired in around 160 countries worldwide . The show 's format is a twist on the game show genre—only one contestant plays at a time ( similar to some radio quizzes ) , and the emphasis is on suspense rather than speed . In most versions there are no time limits to answer the questions , and contestants are given the question before they must decide whether to attempt an answer .   Gameplay   Original rules   The contestants must first play a preliminary round , called `` Fastest Finger First '' ( or , in the U.S. version , simply `` Fastest Finger '' ) , where they are all given a question and four answers from the host and are asked to put those four answers into a particular order ; in the first series of the British version and in pre-2003 episodes of the Australian version , the round instead required the contestants to answer one multiple-choice question correctly as quickly as possible . The contestant who does so correctly and in the fastest time goes on to play the main game for the maximum possible prize ( often a million units of the local currency ) . In the event that two or more contestants are tied for the fastest time , those contestants play another question to break the tie . If no one gets the question right , that question is discarded and another question is played in the same manner . If any contestants are visually impaired , the host reads the question and four choices all at once , then repeats the choices after the music begins .   Main game contestants are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host . Questions are multiple choice : four possible answers are given ( labelled A , B , C and D ) , and the contestant must choose the correct one . The 'D ' answer on the first question ( except in the Shuffle format like in the US version ) is always incorrect and humorous . Upon answering a question correctly , the contestant wins a certain amount of money . In most versions , there is no time limit to answer a question ; a contestant may ( and often does ) take as long as they need to ponder an answer . After the first few questions , the host will ask the contestant if that is their `` final answer '' . When a contestant says `` final '' in conjunction with one of the answers , it is official , and can not be changed . The first five questions usually omit this rule , because the questions are generally so easy that requiring a final answer would significantly slow the game down ; thus , there are five chances for the contestant to leave with no money if they were to provide a wrong answer before obtaining the first guaranteed amount ; going for 1,000 units of currency after winning 500 units is the last point in the game at which a contestant can still leave empty-handed .   Subsequent questions are played for increasingly large sums , roughly doubling at each turn . The first few questions often have some joke answers . On episodes of the UK version aired between 1998 and 2007 , the payout structure was as follows : first going from £100 to £300 in increments of £100 , then from £500 to £64,000 with the pound value doubling for each new question , and finally from £125,000 to £1,000,000 with the pound value doubling for each new question .   After viewing a question , the contestant can leave the game with the money already won rather than attempting an answer . If the contestant"], [61, "The Hobbit , or There and Back Again is a children 's fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien . It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim , being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction . The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children 's literature .   Set in a time `` Between the Dawn of Færie and the Dominion of Men '' , The Hobbit follows the quest of home-loving hobbit Bilbo Baggins to win a share of the treasure guarded by the dragon , Smaug . Bilbo 's journey takes him from light-hearted , rural surroundings into more sinister territory . The story is told in the form of an episodic quest , and most chapters introduce a specific creature , or type of creature , of Tolkien 's geography . By accepting the disreputable , romantic , fey and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense , Bilbo gains a new level of maturity , competence and wisdom . The story reaches its climax in the Battle of the Five Armies , where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict .   Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story . Along with motifs of warfare , these themes have led critics to view Tolkien 's own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story . The author 's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences .   Encouraged by the book 's critical and financial success , the publisher requested a sequel . As Tolkien 's work on the successor The Lord of the Rings progressed , he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit . These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition . Further editions followed with minor emendations , including those reflecting Tolkien 's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled . The work has never been out of print . Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage , screen , radio , board games and video games . Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits .   Characters   Bilbo Baggins , the titular protagonist , is a respectable , reserved hobbit . During his adventure , Bilbo often refers to the contents of his larder at home and wishes he had more food . Until he finds a magic ring , he is more baggage than help . Gandalf , an itinerant wizard , introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves . During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at , only to appear again at key moments in the story . Thorin Oakenshield , the proud , pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain , makes many mistakes in his leadership , relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to get him out of trouble , but he proves himself a mighty warrior . Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin 's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure .   The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance , such as the twelve other dwarves of the company ; two types of elves : both puckish and more serious warrior types ; Men ; man-eating trolls ; boulder-throwing giants ; evil cave-dwelling goblins ; forest-dwelling giant spiders who can speak ; immense and heroic eagles who also speak ; evil wolves , or wargs , who are allied with the goblins ; Elrond the sage ; Gollum , a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake ; Beorn , a man who can assume bear form ; and Bard the Bowman , a grim but honourable archer of Lake-town .   Plot   Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of dwarves , who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the dragon Smaug . When the music ends , Gandalf unveils a map showing a secret door into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition 's `` burglar '' . The dwarves ridicule the idea , but Bilbo , indignant , joins despite himself .   The group travels into the wild , where Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to Rivendell , where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map . Passing over the Misty Mountains"], [62, "Macau ( ; ) , also spelled Macao , officially the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People 's Republic of China , is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta , China . Macau is also bordered by the city of Zhuhai in Mainland China to the North and the Pearl River Estuary to the East and South . Hong Kong lies about 64 kilometers to its East across the Delta . With an estimated population of around 649,100 living in an area of 30.4 km2 ( 11.7 sq mi ) , it is the most densely populated region in the world .   Macau was administered by the Portuguese Empire and its inheritor states from the mid-16th century until late 1999 , when it was the last remaining European colony in Asia . Portuguese traders first settled in Macau in the 1550s . In 1557 , Macau was rented to Portugal from Ming China as a trading port . The Portuguese Empire administered the city under Chinese authority and sovereignty until 1887 , when Macau , through a mutual agreement between the two countries , became a colony . Sovereignty over Macau was transferred to China on 20 December 1999 . The Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau and Macau Basic Law stipulate that Macau operate with a high degree of autonomy until at least 2049 , fifty years after the transfer .   Under the policy of `` one country , two systems '' , the State Council of the People 's Republic of China is responsible for military defense and foreign affairs while Macau maintains its own legal system , the public security force , monetary system , customs policy , and immigration policy . Macau participates in international organizations and events that do not require members to possess national sovereignty .   Macau is among the world 's richest regions , and its GDP per capita by purchasing power parity is higher than that of any country in the world , according to the World Bank . It became the world 's largest gambling centre in 2006 , with the economy heavily dependent on gambling and tourism , as well as manufacturing . According to The World Factbook , Macau has the fourth highest life expectancy in the world . Moreover , it is one of only a few regions in Asia with a `` very high Human Development Index '' , ranking 18th .   Etymology   Macau is otherwise known in Chinese as Haojing ( , literally `` Oyster Mirror '' ) or Jinghai ( , literally `` Mirror Sea '' ) . The name Macau is thought to be derived from the A-Ma Temple ( ) , a temple built in 1448 dedicated to Mazu , the goddess of seafarers and fishermen . It is said that when the Portuguese sailors landed at the coast just outside the temple and asked the name of the place , the natives replied `` '' ( ) . The Portuguese then named the peninsula `` Macau '' . The present Chinese name ( ) means `` Inlet Gates '' .   History   The history of Macau is traced back to the Qin dynasty ( 221–206 BCE ) , when the region now called Macau came under the jurisdiction of Panyu County , Nanhai Prefecture ( modern Guangdong ) . The first recorded Chinese inhabitants of the area were people seeking refuge in Macau from invading Mongols during the Southern Song . Under the Ming dynasty ( 1368–1644 ) , fishermen migrated to Macau from Guangdong and Fujian . The Macau native people were Tanka boat people .   Macau did not develop as a major settlement until the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century . In 1513 , Jorge Álvares became the first Portuguese to land in China . In 1535 , Portuguese traders obtained the rights to anchor ships in Macau 's harbours and to carry out trading activities , though not the right to stay onshore . Around 1552–1553 , they obtained temporary permission to erect storage sheds onshore , in order to dry out goods drenched by sea water ; they soon built rudimentary stone houses around the area now called Nam Van . In 1557 , the Portuguese established a permanent settlement in Macau , paying an annual rent of 500 taels ( 18.9 kilograms41.6 pounds ) of silver . The Portuguese continued to pay an annual tribute up to 1863 in order to stay in Macau .   By 1564 , Portugal commanded western trade with India , Japan , and China . But their pride was shocked by the indifference with which the"], [63, "Eric Anthony Roberts ( born April 18 , 1956 ) is an American actor .

It involved every European great power of the time except the Ottoman Empire , spanning five continents , and affected Europe , the Americas , West Africa , India , and the Philippines . The conflict split Europe into two coalitions , led by Great Britain on one side and France on the other . For the first time , aiming to curtail Britain and Prussia 's ever-growing might , France formed a grand coalition of its own , which ended with failure as Britain rose as the world 's predominant power , altering the European balance of power .   In the historiography of some countries , the war is named after combatants in its respective theatres , e.g . the French and Indian War in the United States . In French-speaking Canada , it is known as the War of the Conquest , while it is called the Seven Years ' War in English-speaking Canada ( North America , 1754–1763 ) , Pomeranian War ( with Sweden and Prussia , 1757–1762 ) , Third Carnatic War ( on the Indian subcontinent , 1757–1763 ) , and Third Silesian War ( with Prussia and Austria , 1756–1763 ) .   Conflict between Great Britain and France broke out in 1754–1756 when the British attacked disputed French positions in North America and seized hundreds of French merchant ships . Meanwhile , rising power Prussia was struggling with Austria for dominance within and outside the Holy Roman Empire in central Europe . In 1756 , the major powers `` switched partners '' .   Realizing that war was imminent , Prussia preemptively struck Saxony and quickly overran it . The result caused uproar across Europe . Because of Prussia 's alliance with Britain , Austria formed an alliance with France , seeing an opportunity to recapture Silesia , which had been lost in a previous war . Reluctantly , by following the imperial diet , most of the states of the empire joined Austria 's cause . The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by smaller German states ( especially Hanover ) . Sweden , fearing Prussia 's expansionist tendencies , went to war in 1757 to protect its Baltic dominions , seeing its chance when virtually all of Europe opposed Prussia . Spain , bound by the Pacte de Famille , intervened on behalf of France and together they launched an utterly unsuccessful invasion of Portugal in 1762 . The Russian Empire was originally aligned with Austria , fearing Prussia 's ambition on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , but switched sides upon the succession of Tsar Peter III in 1762 .   Many middle and small powers in Europe , unlike in the previous wars , tried to steer clear away from the escalating conflict , even though they had interests in the conflict or with the belligerents , like Denmark-Norway . The Dutch Republic , a long-time British ally , kept its neutrality intact , fearing the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe , and even tried to prevent Britain 's domination in India . Naples , Sicily , and Savoy , although sided with the Franco-Spanish alliance , declined to join the coalition under fear of British power . The taxation needed for war caused the Russian people considerable hardship , being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by Empress Elizabeth in 1759 to complete her addition to the Winter Palace . Like Sweden , Russia concluded a separate peace with Prussia .   The war ended with the Treaty of Paris between France , Spain and Great Britain and the Treaty of Hubertusburg between Saxony , Austria and Prussia , in 1763 .   The war was successful for Great Britain , which gained the bulk of New France in North America , Spanish Florida , some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies , the colony of Senegal on the West African coast , and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent . The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement ; a subsequent conflict , known as Pontiac 's War , was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status . In Europe , the war began disastrously for Prussia , but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw King Frederick the Great manage to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum . Prussia emerged as a new European great power . Although Austria failed to retrieve the territory of Silesia from Prussia ( its"], [65, "Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as `` rock and roll '' in the United States in the 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States.W . E. Studwell and D. F. Lonergan , The Classic Rock and Roll Reader : Rock Music from its Beginnings to the mid-1970s ( Abingdon : Routledge , 1999 ) , ISBN 0-7890-0151-9 It has its roots in 1940s ' and 1950s ' rock and roll , itself heavily influenced by blues , rhythm and blues and country music . Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical sources .   Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums . Typically , rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis . The dominance of rock by white , male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music . Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship , live performance , and an ideology of authenticity than pop music .   By the late 1960s , referred to as the `` golden age '' or `` classic rock '' period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic scene . New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted against the perceived overblown , inauthentic and overly mainstream aspects of these genres to produce a stripped-down , energetic form of music valuing raw expression and often lyrically characterised by social and political critiques . Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres , including new wave , post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock . Further fusion subgenres have since emerged , including pop punk , rap rock , and rap metal , as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history , including the garage rock/post-punk and synthpop revivals at the beginning of the new millennium .   Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements , leading to major sub-cultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the hippie counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s . Similarly , 1970s punk culture spawned the visually distinctive goth and emo subcultures . Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song , rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race , sex and drug use , and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity .   Characteristics   The sound of rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar , which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularization of rock and roll , and was influenced by the sounds of electric blues guitarists.Michael Campbell & James Brody , [ https : //books.google.co.uk/books ? id  RK-JmVbv4OIC & pgPA80 Rock and Roll : An Introduction ] , pages 80-81 The sound of an electric guitar in rock music is typically supported by an electric bass guitar , which pioneered in jazz music in the same era , and percussion produced from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals . This trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of other instruments , particularly keyboards such as the piano , Hammond organ and synthesizers . The basic rock instrumentation was adapted from the basic blues band instrumentation ( prominent lead guitar , second chordal instrument , bass , and drums ) . A group of"], [66, "A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature , the other chamber being the upper house .   Despite its official position `` below '' the upper house , in many legislatures worldwide , the lower house has come to wield more power .   A legislature composed of only one house is described as unicameral .  Common attributes   In comparison with the upper house , lower houses frequently display certain characteristics :  ; Powers :  * In a parliamentary system :  * * Much more power , usually based on restrictions against the upper house .  * * Able to override the upper house in some ways .  * * Can vote a motion of no confidence against the government .  * * Exceptions are Australia , where the Senate has considerable power approximate to that of the House of Representatives , and Italy , where the Senate has exactly the same powers as the Chamber of Deputies .  * In a presidential system :  * * Somewhat less power , as the upper house alone gives advice and consent to some executives decisions ( e.g . appointments ) .  * * Given the sole power to impeach the executive ( the upper house then tries the impeachment )  ; Status :  * Always elected directly , while the upper house may be elected directly , indirectly , or not elected at all .  * Its members may be elected with a different voting system to the upper house .  * Most populated administrative divisions are better represented than in the upper house ; representation is usually proportional to population .  * Elected more frequently .  * Elected all at once , not by staggered terms .  * In a parliamentary system , can be dissolved by the executive .  * More members .  * Has total or original control over budget and monetary laws .  * Lower age of candidacy than the upper house .

Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers ; while most set a threshold of three murders , others extend it to four or lessen it to two . The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , for example , defines serial killing as `` a series of two or more murders , committed as separate events , usually , but not always , by one offender acting alone '' .   Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrillseeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion , and the victims may have something in common : age group , appearance , gender , or race , for example .   Serial killing is not the same as mass murdering ( killing numerous people in a given incident ) ; nor is it spree killing ( in which murders are committed in two or more locations , in a short time ) . However , cases of extended bouts of sequential killings over periods of weeks or months with no apparent `` cooling off period '' or `` return to normalcy '' have caused some experts to suggest a hybrid category of `` spree-serial killer '' .   Etymology   The English term and concept of `` serial killer '' are commonly attributed to former FBI Special agent Robert Ressler in 1974 . Author Ann Rule postulates in her book Kiss Me , Kill Me ( 2004 ) that the English-language credit for coining the term serial killer goes to LAPD detective Pierce Brooks , who created the ViCAP system in 1985 . However , in his book Serial Killers : The Method and Madness of Monsters ( 2004 ) , criminal justice historian Peter Vronsky argues that while Ressler might have coined the term serial homicide within law , at Bramshill Police Academy in Britain , the terms serial murder and serial murderer appear in John Brophy 's book The Meaning of Murder ( 1966 ) . In his more recent study , Vronsky states that the term `` serial killing '' first entered into American popular usage when published in the New York Times in the spring of 1981 , to describe Atlanta serial killer Wayne Williams . Subsequently , throughout the 1980s , the term was used in the pages of the New York Times on 233 occasions , but by the end of the 1990s , in the publication 's second decade , the use of the term escalated to 2,514 times in the nation 's `` newspaper of record '' . The German term and concept were coined by the influential Ernst Gennat , who described Peter Kürten as a Serienmörder ( literally `` serial murderer '' ) in his article `` Die Düsseldorfer Sexualverbrechen '' ( 1930 ) . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the specific term `` serial killer '' first arose abroad in a 1960s German film article written by Siegfried Kracauer about the film M ( 1931 ) , a German expressionist film about a pedophilic Serienmörder .   Characteristics   General   Some commonly found characteristics of serial killers include the following :  * They may exhibit varying degrees of mental illness and/or psychopathy , which may contribute to their homicidal behavior .  * * For example , someone who is mentally ill may have psychotic breaks that cause them to believe they are another person or are compelled to murder by other entities .  * * Psychopathic behavior that is consistent with traits common to some serial killers include sensation seeking , a lack of remorse or guilt , impulsivity , the need for control , and predatory behavior . Unlike people with major mental disorders such as schizophrenia , psychopaths can seem normal and often quite charming , a state of adaptation that psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley called the `` mask of sanity '' .  * They were often abused—emotionally , physically and/or sexually—by a family member .  * Serial killers may be more likely to engage in fetishism , partialism or necrophilia , which are paraphilias that involve a strong tendency to experience the object of erotic interest almost as if it were a physical"], [68, "David ( ; ; ISO 259-3 Dawid ; ; ) was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah , reigning c.1010-970 BCE . According to the New Testament , he was an ancestor of Jesus .   Depicted as a valorous warrior of great renown , and a poet and musician credited for composing many of the psalms contained in the Book of Psalms , King David is widely viewed as a righteous and effective king in battle and civil and criminal justice . He is described as a man after God 's own heart in and .   The story of David   God is angered when Saul , Israel 's king , unlawfully offers a sacrifice and later disobeys a divine instruction to utterly destroy the Amalekites . Consequently , he sends the prophet Samuel to anoint David , the youngest son of Jesse of Bethlehem , to be king instead .   God sends an evil spirit to torment Saul . Saul 's courtiers recommend that he send for David , a man skillful on the lyre , wise in speech , and brave in battle . So David enters Saul 's service as one of the royal armour-bearers , and plays the lyre to soothe the king whenever the evil spirit is upon him .   War comes between Israel and the Philistines , and the giant Goliath challenges the Israelites to send out a champion to face him in single combat . David , sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers serving in Saul 's army , declares that he can defeat Goliath . Refusing the king 's offer of the royal armour , he kills Goliath with his sling . Saul inquires the name of the young hero .   Saul sets David over his army . All Israel loves David , but his popularity causes Saul to fear him ( `` What else can he wish but the kingdom ? `` ) . Saul plots his death , but Saul 's son Jonathan , one of those who love David , warns him of his father 's schemes and David flees . He becomes a vassal of the Philistine king Achish of Gath , but Achish 's nobles question his loyalty , and he is left behind to guard the camp when the Philistines march against Saul . Jonathan and Saul are killed , and David is anointed king over Judah . In the north , Saul 's son Ish-Bosheth is anointed king of Israel , and war ensues until Ish-Bosheth is murdered .   With the death of Saul 's son , the elders of Israel come to Hebron and David is anointed king over all Israel . He conquers Jerusalem , previously a Jebusite stronghold , and makes it his capital . He brings the Ark of the Covenant to the city , intending to build a temple for God , but the prophet Nathan forbids it , prophesying that the temple would be built by one of his sons . Nathan also prophesies that God has made a covenant with the house of David : `` Your throne shall be established forever . '' David wins more victories over the Philistines , and the Moabites and Hadadezer of Zobah pay tribute .   David seduces Bathsheba and intentionally causes the death of her husband Uriah the Hittite . In response , Nathan prophesies the punishment that shall fall upon him : `` the sword shall never depart from your house . '' David 's son Absalom rebels . The rebellion ends at the battle of the Wood of Ephraim . Absalom 's forces are routed , and Absalom is caught by his long hair in the branches of a tree , and killed by Joab , the commander of David 's army . David laments the death of his favourite son : `` O my son Absalom , my son , my son Absalom ! Would I had died instead of you , O Absalom , my son , my son ! ''   When David is old and bedridden , Adonijah , his eldest surviving son and natural heir , declares himself king . Bathsheba and Nathan go to David and obtain his agreement to crown Bathsheba 's son Solomon as king , and the revolt of Adonijah is put down . David dies at the age of 70 after reigning 40 years , and on his deathbed counsels Solomon to walk in the ways of God and to take revenge on his enemies .

Generally , a film director controls a film 's artistic and dramatic aspects , and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision . The director has a key role in choosing the cast members , production design , and the creative aspects of filmmaking . Under European Union law , the director is viewed as the author of the film .   The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized , or noticed . Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay in the boundaries of the film 's budget . There are many pathways to becoming a film director . Some film directors started as screenwriters , cinematographers , film editors or actors . Other film directors have attended a film school . Directors use different approaches . Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue , while others control every aspect , and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely . Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners . Some directors edit or appear in their films , or compose the music score for their films .   Responsibility   Film directors create an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized/noticed . Realizing this vision includes overseeing the artistic and technical elements of film production , as well as directing the shooting timetable and meeting deadlines . This entails organizing the film crew in such a way as to achieve their vision of the film . This requires skills of group leadership , as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful , fast-paced environment of a film set . Moreover , it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew , thus , excellent communication skills are a must .   Since the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions , he or she or it or they also needs/need to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary . Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film . The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as `` a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure '' . It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again . Omnipresent are the boundaries of the films budget . Additionally , the director may also have to ensure an intended age rating . Theoretically the sole superior of a director is the studio that is financing the film , however a poor working relationship between a film director and an actor could possibly result in the director being replaced if the actor is a major film star . Even so , it is arguable that the director spends more time on a project than anyone else , considering that the director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production . Thus , the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one . It has been said that `` 20-hour days are not unusual '' .   Under European Union law , the film director is considered the `` author '' or one of the authors of a film , largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory . Auteur theory is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director 's film reflects the director 's personal creative vision , as if they were the primary `` auteur '' ( the French word for `` author '' ) . In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process , the auteur 's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process .   Career pathways   Some film directors started as screenwriters , film editors or actors . Several American cinematographers have become directors , including Barry Sonnenfeld , originally the Coen brothers ' DP ; Jan de Bont , cinematographer on films as Die Hard and Basic Instinct , directed Speed and Twister . Recently Wally Pfister , cinematographer on Christopher Nolan 's three Batman"], [70, "Pall Mall is a street in the St James 's area of the City of Westminster , Central London . It connects St James 's Street to Trafalgar Square and is a section of the regional A4 road . The street 's name is derived from `` pall-mall '' , a ball game played there during the 17th century .   The area was built up during the reign of Charles II with fashionable London residences . It became known for high-class shopping in the 18th century , and gentlemen 's clubs in the 19th . The Reform , Athenaeum and Travellers Clubs have survived to the 21st century . The War Office was based on Pall Mall during the second half of the 19th century , and the Royal Automobile Club 's headquarters have been on the street since 1908 .   Geography   The street is around long and runs east in the St James 's area , from St James 's Street across Waterloo Place , to the Haymarket and continues as Pall Mall East towards Trafalgar Square . The street numbers run consecutively from north-side east to west and then continue on the south-side west to east . It is part of the A4 , a major road running west from Central London . London Bus Route 9 runs westwards along Pall Mall , connecting Trafalgar Square to Piccadilly and Hyde Park Corner .   History and topography   Early history and pall-mall field   Pall Mall was constructed in 1661 , replacing an earlier highway slightly to the south that ran from the Haymarket ( approximately where Warwick House Street is now ) to the royal residence , St James 's Palace . Historical research suggests a road had been in this location since Saxon times , although the earliest documentary references are from the 12th century in connection with a leper colony at St James 's Hospital . When St. James 's Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century , the park 's boundary wall was built along the south side of the road . In 1620 , the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality .   Pall-mall , a ball game similar to croquet , was introduced to England in the early-17th century by James I . The game , already popular in France and Scotland , was enjoyed by James ' sons Henry and Charles . In 1630 , St James 's Field , London 's first pall-mall court , was laid out to the north of the Haymarket – St James road .   After the Restoration and King Charles II 's return to London on 29 May 1660 , a pall-mall court was constructed in St James 's Park just south of the wall , on the site of The Mall . Samuel Pepys 's diary entry for 2 April 1661 records that he `` ... went into St. James 's Park , where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele , the first time that I ever saw the sport . '' This new court suffered from dust blown over the wall from coaches travelling along the highway . In July 1661 posts and rails were erected , stopping up the old road . The court for pall-mall was very long and narrow , and often known as an alley , so the old court provided a suitable route for relocating the eastern approach to St James 's Palace . A grant was made to Dan O'Neale , Groom of the Bedchamber , and John Denham , Surveyor of the King 's Works allocating a 1400 by area of land for this purpose . The grant was endorsed `` Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James 's . ''   A new road was built on the site of the old pall-mall court , and opened in September 1661 . It was named Catherine Street , after Catherine of Braganza , wife of Charles II , but was better known as Pall Mall Street or the Old Pall Mall . The pall-mall field was a popular place for recreation and Pepys records several other visits . By July 1665 Pepys used `` Pell Mell '' to refer to the street as well as the game .   17th- and 18th-century buildings   In 1662 , Pall Mall was one of several streets `` thought fitt immediately to be repaired , new paved or otherwise amended '' under the Streets , London and Westminster Act 1662 .

In recent years , it has taken place on the Memorial Day weekend , running for three to four days . In 2014 , Adam Zacks decided to expand the festival to two weekends due to the high demand for tickets in 2013 . Rather than expanding to two four-day weekends , the festival instead only expanded to two- to three-day weekends .   About the Festival   Sasquatch ! typically features a range of musical genres , with the emphasis being on indie rock bands and singer-songwriters , but also including alternative rock , hip hop , EDM , and comedy acts . As of 2012 the festival features five stages : Sasquatch ! Main Stage , Bigfoot Stage , Banana Shack ( a tent that features primarily comedy acts and electronic music- now known as El Chupacabra ) , Yeti Stage , and Uranus Stage ( the smallest of stages , that generally changes names every year ) .   Most attendees of the festival camp in designated campsite fields nearby , as the venue is relatively remote and there are no large urban areas nearby .   Sasquatch ! was voted as one of the 'Top 10 Summer Music Festivals in the US '' by ConcertBoom .   History   The Sasquatch ! Music Festival was founded in 2002 by Pacific Northwest-based concert promoter Adam Zacks , then at House of Blues . Prior to the inception of the festival , Zacks booked and managed shows at the Roseland Theater in Portland , Oregon . After moving to Seattle , Washington to be closer to friends and family , Zacks began considering the creation of a music festival in the Pacific Northwest . In an interview with Seattle Weekly in September 2007 , Zacks described the birth of Sasquatch ! :   Sasquatch was an idea born on a hunch that there was untapped demand for a certain kind of festival that catered to the eclectic tastes of music enthusiasts . It started in 2002 , which was shortly after a number of the touring festivals ( Lollapalooza , Lilith , Horde ) had petered out and the beginning of the wave of regional festivals that started with Coachella and now is a dominant force on the music landscape , with Bonnaroo , Austin City Limits , etc .   On March 21 , 2014 the Independence Day Weekend of Sasquatch was cancelled . Jeff Trisler , President of Live Nation , released the following statement upon the announcement : `` The Sasquatch ! community has spoken . They continue to support the traditional Memorial Day Weekend event with great enthusiasm , '' Jeff Trisler , president of Live Nation Seattle , said in a statement . `` Unfortunately , the second weekend was not embraced . We felt it was better to cancel the new event now and give everyone time to make alternative plans for the Fourth of July weekend . Going forward , Sasquatch !

It is bordered by Libya to the north , Sudan to the east , the Central African Republic to the south , Cameroon and Nigeria to the southwest and Niger to the west . It is the fifth largest country in Africa in terms of area .   Due to its harsh arid desert climate , it is often known as `` the Dead Heart of Africa . ''   Chad has several regions : a desert zone in the north , an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanian Savanna zone in the south . Lake Chad , after which the country is named , is the largest wetland in Chad and the second-largest in Africa . N'Djamena , the capital , is the largest city . Chad is home to over 200 different ethnic and linguistic groups . Arabic and French are the official languages . Islam and Christianity are the most widely practiced religions .   Beginning in the 7th millennium BC , human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers . By the end of the 1st millennium BC , a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad 's Sahelian strip , each focused on controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region . France conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa . In 1960 , Chad obtained independence under the leadership of François Tombalbaye . Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting civil war in 1965 . In 1979 the rebels conquered the capital and put an end to the south 's hegemony . However , the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until Hissène Habré defeated his rivals . He was overthrown in 1990 by his general Idriss Déby . Since 2003 the Darfur crisis in Sudan has spilt over the border and destabilised the nation , with hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees living in and around camps in eastern Chad .   While many political parties are active , power lies firmly in the hands of President Déby and his political party , the Patriotic Salvation Movement . Chad remains plagued by political violence and recurrent attempted coups d'état . Chad is one of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the world ; most inhabitants live in poverty as subsistence herders and farmers . Since 2003 crude oil has become the country 's primary source of export earnings , superseding the traditional cotton industry .   History   In the 7th millennium BC , ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favored human settlement , and the region experienced a strong population increase . Some of the most important African archaeological sites are found in Chad , mainly in the Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region ; some date to earlier than 2000 BC .   For more than 2,000 years , the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and sedentary people . The region became a crossroads of civilizations . The earliest of these were the legendary Sao , known from artifacts and oral histories . The Sao fell to the Kanem Empire , D . Lange 1988 the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad 's Sahelian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD . Two other states in the region , Baguirmi and Wadai Empire emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries . The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the trans-Saharan trade routes that passed through the region . These states , at least tacitly Muslim , never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to raid for slaves . In Kanem , about a third of the population were slaves .   French colonial expansion led to the creation of the in 1900 . By 1920 , France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of French Equatorial Africa . French rule in Chad was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation compared to other French colonies .   The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton ; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929 . The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service . Only the Sara of the south was governed effectively ; French presence in the Islamic north and east was"], [73, "Treasure Island is an adventure novel by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson , narrating a tale of `` buccaneers and buried gold '' . It was originally serialized in the children 's magazine Young Folks between 1881 through 1882 under the title Treasure Island , or the mutiny of the Hispaniola , credited to the pseudonym `` Captain George North '' . It was first published as a book on 14 November 1883 by Cassell & Co .   Treasure Island is traditionally considered a coming-of-age story , and is noted for its atmosphere , characters , and action . It is also noted as a wry commentary on the ambiguity of morality—as seen in Long John Silver—unusual for children 's literature . It is one of the most frequently dramatized of all novels . Its influence is enormous on popular perceptions of pirates , including such elements as treasure maps marked with an `` X '' , schooners , the Black Spot , tropical islands , and one-legged seamen bearing parrots on their shoulders.Cordingly , David ( 1995 ) Under the Black Flag : the romance and reality of life among the pirates ; p. 7   Plot summary   ; PART I— '' THE OLD BUCCANEER ''   An old sailor , calling himself `` the captain '' —real name `` Billy '' Bones—comes to lodge at the Admiral Benbow Inn on the west English coast during the mid-1700s , paying the innkeeper 's son , Jim Hawkins , a few pennies to keep a lookout for a one-legged `` seafaring man . '' A seaman with intact legs shows up , frightening Billy—who drinks far too much rum—into a stroke , and Billy tells Jim that his former shipmates covet the contents of his sea chest . After a visit from yet another man , Billy has another stroke and dies ; Jim and his mother ( his father has also died just a few days before ) unlock the sea chest , finding some money , a journal , and a map . The local physician , Dr. Livesey , deduces that the map is of an island where a deceased pirate—Captain Flint—buried a vast treasure . The district squire , Trelawney , proposes buying a ship and going after the treasure , taking Livesey as ship 's doctor and Jim as cabin boy .   ; PART II— '' THE SEA COOK ''   Several weeks later , Trelawney sends for Jim and Livesey and introduces them to `` Long John '' Silver , a one-legged Bristol tavern-keeper whom he has hired as ship 's cook . ( Silver enhances his outre attributes—crutch , pirate argot , etc.—with a talking parrot . ) They also meet Captain Smollett , who tells them that he dislikes most of the crew on the voyage , which it seems everyone in Bristol knows is a search for treasure . After taking a few precautions , however , they set sail on Trelawny 's schooner , the Hispaniola , for the distant island . During the voyage the first mate , a drunkard , disappears overboard . And just before the island is sighted , Jim—concealed in an apple barrel—overhears Silver talking with two other crewmen . They are all former `` gentlemen o'fortune '' ( pirates ) in Flint 's crew and have planned a mutiny . Jim alerts the captain , doctor , and squire , and they calculate that they will be seven to 19 against the mutineers and must pretend not to suspect anything until the treasure is found , when they can surprise their adversaries .   ; PART III— '' MY SHORE ADVENTURE ''   But after the ship is anchored , Silver and some of the others go ashore , and two men who refuse to join the mutiny are killed—one with so loud a scream that everyone realizes there can be no more pretense . Jim has impulsively joined the shore party and covertly witnessed Silver committing one of the murders ; now , in fleeing , he encounters a half-crazed Englishman , Ben Gunn , who tells him he was marooned here and can help against the mutineers in return for passage home and part of the treasure .   ; PART IV— '' THE STOCKADE ''   Meanwhile , Smollett , Trelawney , and Livesey , along with Trelawney 's three servants and one of the other hands , Abraham Gray , abandon the ship and come ashore to occupy an old abandoned stockade .

Since the 1960s , South Korea has emerged as a major football power in Asia and is historically the most successful Asian football team , having participated in eight consecutive and nine overall FIFA World Cup tournaments , the most for any Asian country . Despite initially going through five World Cup tournaments without winning a match , South Korea became the first and currently only Asian team to reach the semi-final stages after using intense tactics and the subjectivity of the match officials during games against Italy and Spain when they co-hosted the 2002 tournament with Japan . They have since improved their ability to play on foreign soil and were able to reach the Round of 16 in the 2010 World Cup . South Korea won the first two AFC Asian Cup tournaments though they have been unable to win since , finishing second in 1972 , 1980 , 1988 , and 2015 , and third in 1964 , 2000 , 2007 , and 2011 . They also took the gold medal at the 1970 , 1978 , 1986 , and 2014 Asian Games .   The team is commonly nicknamed `` The Reds '' by both fans and the media due to the color of their primary kit . The national team 's supporting group is officially referred to as the Red Devils .   History   Pre–1954   Koreans were not introduced to football until 1882 , when British crew members played a game while their vessel was visiting the Incheon Port . In 1921 , the first All Korea Football Tournament was held , and in 1928 , The Korea Football Association was organized , which created a foundation to disseminate and develop football in Korea . In 1940 , however , the Governor-General of Korea forced the Korea Football Association to dissolve .   Following the establishment of the Republic of Korea , the Korea Football Association ( KFA ) was reinstated in 1948 and joined FIFA , the international football governing body . The same year , the Korean national team made its international debut at the Olympic Games in London . The KFA joined the AFC ( Asian Football Confederation ) in 1954 .   1954–1989   South Korea first entered the World Cup in 1954 as the second Asian team ever to compete in the World Cup after the Dutch East Indies . South Korea played games against Hungary and Turkey , losing 9–0 and 7–0 respectively ( the game scheduled against West Germany was never played because neither were seeded in their group , as per that tournament 's rules ) . It would take thirty-two years before South Korea was able to participate in the World Cup finals again .   South Korea would later participate in the first Asian Cup in 1956 . They drew with Hong Kong but defeated Israel and South Vietnam to take first place . They hosted and won the second Asian Cup in 1960 , winning all of their games . However , they failed to repeat this success and lost all their games in the 1964 Asian Cup and failed to qualify in 1968 . They recovered in 1972 and took second place . They once again failed to qualify in 1976 but reached second place again in 1980 .   In 1986 , South Korea was able to qualify for the 1986 FIFA World Cup , held in Mexico , for the first time since 1954 . They , however , failed to win a game despite the presence of Cha Bum-kun , at the time one of the best Asian players , losing 3–1 to Argentina , drawing 1–1 with Bulgaria , and losing 3–2 to Italy .   Their next major tournament was the 1988 AFC Asian Cup , in which they won all their games in the group stage and defeated China 2–1 in the semi-finals but lost on penalties 4–3 in the final against Saudi Arabia .   1990–2001   South Korea started the 1990s poorly . At the 1990 FIFA World Cup , they lost all their games against Spain 3–1 , Uruguay 1–0 , and Belgium 2–0 . South Korea failed to qualify for the 1992 Asian Cup as well .   In the 1994 FIFA World Cup they managed to draw with Spain 2–2 . Hong Myung-bo scored a goal and assisted teammate Seo Jung-won with the second , with both goals occurring in the last five minutes of the game . In their next game they"], [75, "The G20 ( or G-20 or Group of Twenty ) is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 20 major economies . It was founded in 1999 with the aim of studying , reviewing , and promoting high-level discussion of policy issues pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability . It seeks to address issues that go beyond the responsibilities of any one organization . The G20 heads of government or heads of state have periodically conferred at summits since their initial meeting in 2008 , and the group also hosts separate meetings of finance ministers and central bank governors .   The members include 19 individual countries—Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , South Korea , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , Turkey , the United Kingdom and the United States—along with the European Union ( EU ) . The EU is represented by the European Commission and by the European Central Bank . Collectively , the G20 economies account for around 85 % of the gross world product ( GWP ) , 80 % of world trade ( or , if excluding EU intra-trade , 75 % ) , and two-thirds of the world population .   With the G20 growing in stature after its inaugural leaders ' summit in 2008 , its leaders announced on 25 September 2009 that the group would replace the G8 as the main economic council of wealthy nations . Since its inception , the G20 's membership policies have been criticized by numerous intellectuals , and its summits have been a focus for major protests by anti-globalists , nationalists and others .   The heads of the G20 nations met semi-annually at G20 summits between 2009 and 2010 . Since the November 2011 Cannes summit , all G20 summits have been held annually .   History   The G20 is the latest in a series of post-World War II initiatives aimed at international coordination of economic policy , which include institutions such as the `` Bretton Woods twins '' , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , and what is now the World Trade Organization . The G20 superseded the G33 ( which had itself superseded the G22 ) , and was foreshadowed at the Cologne Summit of the G7 in June 1999 , but was only formally established at the G7 Finance Ministers ' meeting on 26 September 1999 . The inaugural meeting took place on 15–16 December 1999 in Berlin . Canadian finance minister Paul Martin was chosen to be the first chairman and German finance minister Hans Eichel hosted the inaugural meeting .   According to researchers at the Brookings Institution , the group was founded primarily at the initiative of Eichel , who was also concurrently chair of the G7 . However , some sources identify the G20 as a joint creation of Germany and the United States . According to University of Toronto political science professor John Kirton , the membership of the G20 was decided by Eichel 's deputy Caio Koch-Weser and then US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers ' deputy Timothy Geithner . In Kirton 's book G20 Governance for a Globalised World , he claims that :   Though the G20 's primary focus is global economic governance , the themes of its summits vary from year to year . For example , the theme of the 2006 G20 ministerial meeting was `` Building and Sustaining Prosperity '' . The issues discussed included domestic reforms to achieve `` sustained growth '' , global energy and resource commodity markets , reform of the World Bank and IMF , and the impact of demographic changes due to an aging world population . Trevor A. Manuel , the South African Minister of Finance , was the chairperson of the G20 when South Africa hosted the secretariat in 2007 . Guido Mantega , Brazil 's Minister of Finance , was the chairperson of the G20 in 2008 ; Brazil proposed dialogue on competition in financial markets , clean energy and economic development and fiscal elements of growth and development . In a statement following a meeting of G7 finance ministers on 11 October 2008 , US President George W. Bush stated that the next meeting of the G20 would be important in finding solutions to the burgeoning economic crisis of 2008 . An initiative by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown led to a special meeting of the G20 , a G20 Leaders Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy , on 15 November 2008 .

More than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history . Over 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians died as a result of the war ( including the victims of a number of genocides ) , a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents ' technological and industrial sophistication , and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare . It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history , and paved the way for major political changes , including revolutions in many of the nations involved .   The war drew in all the world 's economic great powers , assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the British Empire , France and the Russian Empire ) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary . Although Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary , it did not join the Central Powers , as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive , against the terms of the alliance . These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , while the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers .   The trigger for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 . This set off a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia , and entangled international alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked . Within weeks , the major powers were at war and the conflict soon spread around the world .   On 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia . As Russia mobilised in support of Serbia , Germany invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg before moving towards France , leading the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany . After the German march on Paris was halted , what became known as the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition , with a trench line that changed little until 1917 . On the Eastern Front , the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians , but the Germans stopped its invasion of East Prussia . In November 1914 , the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers , opening fronts in the Caucasus , Mesopotamia and the Sinai . In 1915 , Italy joined the Allies and Bulgaria joined the Central Power ; Romania joined the Allies in 1916 , as did the United States in 1917 .   The Russian government collapsed in March 1917 , and a revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers via the Treaty of Brest Litovsk , which was a massive German victory . After a stunning German offensive along the Western Front in the spring of 1918 , the Allies rallied and drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives . On 4 November 1918 , the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to an armistice , and Germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918 , ending the war in victory for the Allies .   By the end of the war , the German Empire , Russian Empire , Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist . National borders were redrawn , with several independent nations restored or created , and Germany 's colonies were parceled out among the winners . During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 , the Big Four ( Britain , France , the United States and Italy ) imposed their terms in a series of treaties . The League of Nations was formed with the aim of preventing any repetition of such a conflict . This effort failed , and economic depression , renewed European nationalism , weakened member states , and the German feeling of humiliation contributed to the rise of Nazism . These conditions eventually contributed to World War II .   Names   From the time of its start until the approach of World War II , the First World War was called simply the World War or the Great War and thereafter the First World War or World War I . At the time , it was also sometimes called `` the war to end war ''"], [77, "A musical instrument is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds . In principle , any object that produces sound can be a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument . The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture . Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual , such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt , or a drum in a religious ceremony . Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment . Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications .   The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed . The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument , a simple flute , dates back as far as 67,000 years . Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago . However , most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them . Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins , bone , wood , and other non-durable materials .   Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world . However , contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin . By the Middle Ages , instruments from Mesopotamia were in maritime Southeast Asia , and Europeans played instruments from North Africa . Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace , but cultures of North , Central , and South America shared musical instruments . By 1400 , musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident .   Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right , and many systems of classification have been used over the years . Instruments can be classified by their effective range , their material composition , their size , etc . However , the most common academic method , Hornbostel-Sachs , uses the means by which they produce sound . The academic study of musical instruments is called organology .   Definition and basic operation   A musical instrument makes sounds . Once humans moved from making sounds with their bodies—for example , by clapping—to using objects to create music from sounds , musical instruments were born . Primitive instruments were probably designed to emulate natural sounds , and their purpose was ritual rather than entertainment . The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were unknown to early players of musical instruments . A player sounding a flute to signal the start of a hunt does so without thought of the modern notion of `` making music '' .   Musical instruments are constructed in a broad array of styles and shapes , using many different materials . Early musical instruments were made from `` found objects '' such a shells and plant parts . As instruments evolved , so did the selection and quality of materials . Virtually every material in nature has been used by at least one culture to make musical instruments . One plays a musical instrument by interacting with it in some way—for example , by plucking the strings on a string instrument .   Archaeology   Researchers have discovered archaeological evidence of musical instruments in many parts of the world . Some finds are 67,000 years old , however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute . Consensus solidifies about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later . Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive . As such , the specimens found can not be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments .   In July 1995 , Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Turk discovered a bone carving in the northwest region of Slovenia . The carving , named the Divje Babe Flute , features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined could have been used to play four notes of a diatonic scale . Researchers estimate the flute 's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years , making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture . However , some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute 's status as a musical instrument . German archaeologists have found mammoth bone and swan bone flutes dating back to 30,000 to 37,000 years old in the Swabian Alps . The flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic age , and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments .

She also wrote six romances under the name Mary Westmacott including Giant 's Bread , but she is best known for the 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections that she wrote under her own name , most of which revolve around the investigative work of such characters as Hercule Poirot , Jane Marple , Parker Pyne , Ariadne Oliver , Harley Quin/Mr Satterthwaite and Tommy and Tuppence Beresford . She wrote the world 's longest-running play , a murder mystery , The Mousetrap . In 1971 she was made a Dame for her contribution to literature .   Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay , Devon . She served in a hospital during the First World War before marrying and starting a family in London . She was initially unsuccessful at getting her work published , but in 1920 The Bodley Head press published her novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles , featuring the character of Hercule Poirot . This launched her literary career .   The Guinness Book of World Records lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time . Her novels have sold roughly 2 billion copies , and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world 's most-widely published books , behind only Shakespeare 's works and the Bible . According to Index Translationum , she remains the most-translated individual author – having been translated into at least 103 languages . And Then There Were None is Christie 's best-selling novel , with 100 million sales to date , making it the world 's best-selling mystery ever , and one of the best-selling books of all time .   Christie 's stage play The Mousetrap holds the record for the longest initial run : it opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25 November 1952 and is still running after more than 25,000 performances . In 1955 Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America 's highest honour , the Grand Master Award . Later the same year , Witness for the Prosecution received an Edgar Award by the MWA for Best Play . In 2013 , The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was voted the best crime novel ever by 600 fellow writers of the Crime Writers ' Association .   On 15 September 2015 , coinciding with Christie 's 125th birthday , And Then There Were None was voted as the `` World 's Favourite Christie '' , followed closely by Murder on the Orient Express and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd . Most of her books and short stories have been adapted for television , radio , video games and comics , and more than thirty feature films have been based on her work .   Life and career   Childhood : 1890–1901   Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born on 15 September 1890 into a wealthy upper middle-class family in Ashfield , Torquay , Devon . Her mother , Clara Boehmer , was an Englishwoman who was born in Belfast in 1854 to Captain Frederick Boehmer and Mary Ann West , the couple 's only daughter . Clara Boehmer had four brothers , one of whom died young . Captain Boehmer was killed in a riding accident while stationed on Jersey in April 1863 , leaving Mary Ann ( Agatha Christie 's grandmother ) to raise her children alone on a meagre income . Under financial strain , she sent Clara ( Christie 's mother ) to live with her aunt Margaret Miller ( née West ) , who had married a wealthy American , Nathaniel Frary Miller , in 1863 . The couple lived in Prinsted , West Sussex . Clara stayed with Margaret , and there she met her future husband , an American stockbroker named Frederick Alvah Miller , who was the son of Nathaniel .   Christie 's father Frederick was a member of the American upper class , and had been sent to Switzerland for his education . He was considered personable and friendly by those who knew him . He soon developed a romantic relationship with Clara , and they were married in April 1878 . Their first child , Margaret Frary Miller ( 1879–1950 ) , was born in Torquay , where the couple were renting lodgings , while their second , Louis `` Monty '' Montant ( 1880–1929 ) , was born in the U.S. state of New York , where Frederick was on a"], [79, "George Edward Foreman ( born January 10 , 1949 ) is an American former professional boxer . Nicknamed `` Big George '' , in his boxing career he was a two-time world heavyweight champion and an Olympic gold medalist . Outside the sport he went on to become an ordained minister , author and entrepreneur .   After a troubled childhood , Foreman took up boxing and was a gold medalist at the 1968 Olympics . He won the world heavyweight title with a second-round knockout of then-undefeated Joe Frazier in Kingston , Jamaica , in 1973 . He made two successful title defenses before losing to Muhammad Ali in `` The Rumble in the Jungle '' in October 1974 . He was unable to secure another title shot , and retired following a loss to Jimmy Young in 1977 . Following what he referred to as a religious epiphany , Foreman became an ordained Christian minister . Ten years later , he announced a comeback and , in November 1994 , at age 45 , he regained a portion of the heavyweight championship by knocking out 27-year-old Michael Moorer to win the WBA and IBF titles . Foreman remains the oldest heavyweight champion in history , and the second oldest in any weight class after Bernard Hopkins . He retired in 1997 at the age of 48 , with a final record of 76 wins 5 losses and 68 knockouts .   Foreman has been inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame and the International Boxing Hall of Fame . The International Boxing Research Organization ( IBRO ) rates Foreman as the eighth greatest heavyweight of all time . In 2002 , he was named one of the 25 greatest fighters of the past 80 years by The Ring magazine . The Ring ranked him as the ninth greatest puncher of all time . He was a ringside analyst for HBO 's boxing coverage for twelve years , leaving in 2004 . Outside of boxing , he is a successful entrepreneur and is known for his promotion of the George Foreman Grill , which has sold over 100 million units worldwide . In 1999 he sold the naming rights to the grill for $ 138 million .   Early life   George Foreman was born in Marshall , Texas . He grew up in the Fifth Ward , Houston , with six siblings . Although he was raised by J.D . Foreman , whom his mother had married when George was a small child , his biological father was Leroy Moorehead . Foreman was interested in football and idolized Jim Brown , but gave it up for boxing . He won a gold medal in the boxing/heavyweight division at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games . By his own admission in his autobiography , George was a troubled youth . He dropped out of school at the age of fifteen and later joined the Job Corps . After moving to Pleasanton , California , with the help of a supervisor he began to train in boxing .   Professional career   Foreman had an amateur record of 22–4 , losing twice to Clay Hodges ( also defeated by Max Briggs in his first ever fight ) . Foreman turned professional in 1969 with a three-round knockout of Donald Walheim in New York . He had a total of 13 fights that year , winning all of them ( 11 by knockout ) .   In 1970 , Foreman continued his march toward the undisputed heavyweight title , winning all 12 of his bouts ( 11 by knockout ) . Among the opponents he defeated were Gregorio Peralta , whom he decisioned at Madison Square Garden although Peralta showed that Foreman was vulnerable to fast counter punching mixed with an assertive boxing style . Foreman then defeated George Chuvalo by technical knockout ( TKO ) in three rounds . After this win , Foreman defeated Charlie Polite in four rounds and Boone Kirkman in three .   In 1971 , Foreman won seven more fights , winning all of them by knockout , including a rematch with Peralta , whom he defeated by knockout in the tenth and final round in Oakland , California , and a win over Leroy Caldwell , who was knocked out in the second round . After amassing a record of 32–0 ( 29 KO ) , he was ranked as the number one challenger by the WBA and WBC .   Sunshine Showdown versus Joe Frazier   In 1972 , still undefeated and with an impressive knockout record , Foreman was set to challenge undefeated and Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion Joe Frazier ."], [80, "The Cat Who Walks Through Walls is a science fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein published in 1985 . Like many of his later novels , it features Lazarus Long and Jubal Harshaw as supporting characters .   Plot summary   A writer seated at the best restaurant of the space habitat `` Golden Rule '' is approached by a man who urges him that `` Tolliver must die '' and is himself shot before the writer 's eyes . The writer — Colonel Colin Campbell , living under a number of aliases including his pen name `` Richard Ames '' — is joined by a beautiful and sophisticated lady , Gwendolyn Novak , who helps him flee to Luna with a bonsai maple and a would-be murderer ( `` Bill '' ) . After escaping to the moon , Gwen claims to have been present during the revolt described in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress .   Still pursued by assassins , Campbell and Novak are rescued by an organization known as the Time Corps under the leadership of Lazarus Long . After giving Campbell a new leg to replace one lost in combat years before , the Time Corps attempt to recruit Campbell for a special mission . Accepting only on Gwen 's account , Campbell agrees to assist a team to retrieve the decommissioned Mike , a sentient computer introduced in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress . Engaged in frequent time-travel , the Time Corps has been responsible for changing various events in the past , creating an alternate universe with every time-line they disrupt . Mike 's assistance is needed in order to accurately predict the conditions and following events in each of the new universes created . Campbell 's frequent would-be assassins are revealed to be members of contemporary agencies also engaged in time manipulation who , for unknown reasons , do not want to see Mike rescued by the Time Corps .   During the mission , Gwen is grievously wounded and Campbell loses his foot again , though the Time Corps succeed in retrieving Mike . The story ends with Campbell talking into a recorder ( presumably the source of the first-person narrative ) reflecting on the mission and his relationship with Gwen .   Background   The Cat Who Walks Through Walls may be regarded as part of Heinlein 's multiverse series , or as a sequel to both The Number of the Beast and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress . During a meeting of the Council of the Time Scouts , representatives from every major time line and setting written by Heinlein appear , including Glory Road and Starship Troopers and references are made to other authors ' works as well .   The title of the book refers to a cat by the name of Pixel , who has an inexplicable tendency to be wherever the narrator happens to be ( see Schrödinger 's cat ) . In one scene Pixel does , in fact , walk through a wall , and it is explained that Pixel is too young to know that such behavior is impossible .   Connections to other Heinlein works   Gwen Novak is eventually revealed to be Hazel Stone , a character previously featured in Heinlein 's The Rolling Stones and who had played a small but important role in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress . Campbell is also eventually revealed to be a son of Lazarus Long , a Heinlein character originally introduced in Methuselah 's Children and who reappeared in Time Enough for Love , The Number of the Beast , and To Sail Beyond the Sunset . Also appearing are Jubal Harshaw , a major character in Stranger in a Strange Land ; Galahad , of Time Enough for Love ; and Manuel Garcia O'Kelly Davis , the first-person voice of The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress ."], [81, "The Shadows are a British instrumental rock group , and Cliff Richard 's backing band , with 69 UK chart singles from the 1950s to the 2000s , 35 credited to the Shadows and 34 to Cliff Richard and the Shadows . The group , who were in the forefront of the UK beat-group boom , were the first backing band to emerge as stars . As pioneers of the four-member instrumental format , the band consisted of lead guitar , rhythm guitar , bass guitar and drums . Their range covers pop , rock , surf rock and ballads with a jazz influence .   The core members are Hank Marvin , Bruce Welch and Brian Bennett . The sound was produced by Fender and Burns guitars , amplifiers by Vox and echo units Meazzi Echomatic tape and Binson magnetic disc . The Shadows , with Cliff Richard , dominated British popular music in the late 1950s and early 1960s in the years before the Beatles . Although they lost ground in the late sixties , the band had a second success from the late seventies .   The Shadows are the third most successful act in the UK singles chart , behind Elvis Presley and Cliff Richard . The Shadows and Cliff Richard & the Shadows each have had four No.1 selling EPs .   Overview   The Shadows were formed from members of late 1950s UK skiffle groups : the Newcastle-based Railroaders ( and also the Five Chesternuts on Columbia Records ) who supplied Hank Marvin and Bruce Welch , both inspired by US pop music ; and the Vipers Skiffle Group ( on Parlophone Records ) who supplied Jet Harris and Tony Meehan from London , both inspired by UK jazz–skiffle music . The Shadows , although originally the backing band for Richard , were later an instrumental combo , following their success with the Jerry Lordan composition , `` Apache '' .   The Shadows disbanded in 1968 but Marvin and Welch formed a vocal–guitar trio with John Farrar , as Marvin Welch & Farrar . Because of low sales and fans demanding Shadows numbers at gigs , the Shadows reformed in 1973 with Bennett as a full member and various extra musicians . The group disbanded in 1990 but reformed in 2004–05 for a UK and continental European tour and again during 2008–10 to tour and release an album with a 50th anniversary reunion with Richard .   History   Formed as a backing band for Cliff Richard under the name the Drifters , the original members were founder Ken Pavey ( born 1932 ) , Terry Smart on drums ( 1942 ) , Norman Mitham on guitar ( 1941 ) , Ian Samwell on guitar and Harry Webb ( before he became Cliff Richard ) on guitar and vocals . They had no bass player . Samwell wrote the first hit , `` Move It '' , often mistakenly attributed to Cliff Richard and the Shadows . Initially , Norrie Paramor wanted to record using only studio musicians but after persuasion he allowed Smart and Samwell to play as well . Two session players , guitarist Ernie Shear and bassist Frank Clark , played on the `` Move It '' / '' Schoolboy Crush '' single on Paramor 's insistence to ensure a strong sound . In his memoirs Welch regrets that he and Marvin could not be at the start of making history with `` Move It '' .   The Drifters signed for Jack Good 's Oh Boy ! television series . Paramor of EMI signed Richard , and asked Johnny Foster to recruit a better guitarist . Foster went to Soho 's 2i 's coffee bar , known for musical talent performing there , particularly in skiffle , in search of guitarist Tony Sheridan . Sheridan was not there but Foster 's attention was caught by another musician , who played guitar well and had Buddy Holly-style glasses .   In spring the same year , the US Drifters threatened legal action after the release and immediate withdrawal of `` Feelin Fine '' in the US . The second single , `` Jet Black '' , was released in the US as The Four Jets to avoid further legal aggravation but a new band name was urgently needed . The name the Shadows was invented by Harris ( unaware of Bobby Vee 's backing group ) while he and Marvin were at the Six Bells pub in Ruislip in July 1959 .

He is often called England 's national poet , and the `` Bard of Avon '' . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 38 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright .   Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna , and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 , at age 49 , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive , which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , sexuality , and religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others .   Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613 . His early plays were primarily comedies and histories , and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres . He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608 , including Hamlet , Othello , King Lear , and Macbeth , considered some of the finest works in the English language . In his last phase , he wrote tragicomedies , also known as romances , and collaborated with other playwrights .   Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime . In 1623 , however , John Heminges and Henry Condell , two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare , published a more definitive text known as the First Folio , a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare 's . It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson , in which Shakespeare is hailed , presciently , as `` not of an age , but for all time '' .The Norton Anthology of English Literature : Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century , Volume B , 2012 , pg . 1168   In the 20th and 21st centuries , his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance . His plays remain highly popular , and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world .   Life   Early life   William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare , an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield , and Mary Arden , the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer . He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564 . His actual date of birth remains unknown , but is traditionally observed on 23 April , Saint George 's Day . This date , which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar 's mistake , has proved appealing to biographers , because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 . He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son .   Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered in 1553 , about a quarter-mile ( 400 m ) from his home . Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era , but grammar school curricula were largely similar : the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors .   At the age of 18 , Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway . The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582 . The next day , two of Hathaway 's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage . The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste , since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of"], [83, "An antifreeze is an additive which lowers the freezing point of a water-based liquid . An antifreeze mixture is used to achieve freezing-point depression for cold environments and also achieves boiling-point elevation ( `` anti-boil '' ) to allow higher coolant temperature . Freezing and boiling points are colligative properties of a solution , which depend on the concentration of the dissolved substance .   Because water has good properties as a coolant , water plus antifreeze is used in internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications , such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters . The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes . Commercially , both the additive ( pure concentrate ) and the mixture ( diluted solution ) are called antifreeze , depending on the context . Careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a wide temperature range in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase , which is critical to efficient heat transfer and the proper functioning of heat exchangers .   Salts are frequently used for de-icing , but salt solutions are not used for cooling systems because they can cause severe corrosion to metals . Instead , non-corrosive antifreezes are commonly used for critical de-icing , such as for aircraft wings .   Automotive and internal combustion engine use   Most automotive engines are `` water '' -cooled to remove waste heat , although the `` water '' is actually antifreeze/water mixture and not plain water . The term engine coolant is widely used in the automotive industry , which covers its primary function of convective heat transfer for internal combustion engines . When used in an automotive context , corrosion inhibitors are added to help protect vehicles ' radiators , which often contain a range of electrochemically incompatible metals ( aluminum , cast iron , copper , brass , solder , et cetera ) . Water pump seal lubricant is also added .   Antifreeze was developed to overcome the shortcomings of water as a heat transfer fluid . In some engines freeze plugs ( engine block expansion plugs ) are placed in areas of the engine block where coolant flows in order to protect the engine from freeze damage if the ambient temperature drops below the freezing point of the antifreeze/water mixture . These should not be confused with core plugs , whose purpose is to allow removal of sand used in the casting process of engine blocks ( core plugs will be pushed out if the coolant freezes , though , assuming that they adjoin the coolant passages , which is not always the case ) .   On the other hand , if the engine coolant gets too hot , it might boil while inside the engine , causing voids ( pockets of steam ) , leading to localized hot spots and the catastrophic failure of the engine . If plain water were to be used as an engine coolant , it would promote galvanic corrosion . Proper engine coolant and a pressurized coolant system can help obviate the problems which make plain water incompatible with automotive engines . With proper antifreeze , a wide temperature range can be tolerated by the engine coolant , such as to for 50 % ( by volume ) propylene glycol diluted with water and a 15 psi pressurized coolant system .   Early engine coolant antifreeze was methanol ( methyl alcohol ) . Methanol was widely used in windshield fluids , however , in Europe , due to new REACH legislation , the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5 % and in the near future will be further reduced to 3 % . As radiator caps were vented , not sealed , the methanol was lost to evaporation , requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant . Methanol also accelerates corrosion of the metals , especially aluminum , used in the engine and cooling systems . Ethylene glycol was developed , and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze . It has a very low volatility compared to methanol and to water . Before the 1950s , coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines . By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap , the boiling point of the fluid is increased , permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency . Pressurized systems do not appreciably change the freezing point .   Other uses   The most common water-based antifreeze solutions used in electronics cooling are mixtures of water and either ethylene glycol ( EGW ) or propylene glycol ( PGW ) .

His career spanned more than 75 years , from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977 , and encompassed both adulation and controversy .   Chaplin 's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship . As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially , he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine . When he was 14 , his mother was committed to a mental asylum . Chaplin began performing at an early age , touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian . At 19 he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company , which took him to America . Chaplin was scouted for the film industry , and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios . He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base . Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage , and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay , Mutual , and First National corporations . By 1918 , he was one of the best known figures in the world .   In 1919 , Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists , which gave him complete control over his films . His first feature-length was The Kid ( 1921 ) , followed by A Woman of Paris ( 1923 ) , The Gold Rush ( 1925 ) , and The Circus ( 1928 ) . He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s , instead producing City Lights ( 1931 ) and Modern Times ( 1936 ) without dialogue . Chaplin became increasingly political , and his next film , The Great Dictator ( 1940 ) , satirised Adolf Hitler . The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin , and his popularity declined rapidly . He was accused of communist sympathies , while his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women caused scandal . An FBI investigation was opened , and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland . He abandoned the Tramp in his later films , which include Monsieur Verdoux ( 1947 ) , Limelight ( 1952 ) , A King in New York ( 1957 ) , and A Countess from Hong Kong ( 1967 ) .   Chaplin wrote , directed , produced , edited , starred in , and composed the music for most of his films . He was a perfectionist , and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture . His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos , typified in the Tramp 's struggles against adversity . Many contain social and political themes , as well as autobiographical elements . In 1972 , as part of a renewed appreciation for his work , Chaplin received an Honorary Academy Award for `` the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century '' . He continues to be held in high regard , with The Gold Rush , City Lights , Modern Times , and The Great Dictator often ranked on industry lists of the greatest films of all time .   Biography   Early years ( 1889–1913 )   Background and childhood hardship   Charles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin ( born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill ) and Charles Chaplin Sr . There is no official record of his birth , although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street , Walworth , in South London . His mother and father had married four years previously , at which time Charles Sr. became the legal carer of Hannah 's illegitimate son , Sydney John Hill . At the time of his birth , Chaplin 's parents were both music hall entertainers . Hannah , the daughter of a shoemaker , had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley , while Charles Sr. , a butcher 's son , was a popular singer . Although they never divorced , Chaplin 's parents were estranged by around 1891 . The following year , Hannah gave birth to a third son – George Wheeler Dryden – fathered"], [85, "Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks , concerning their gods and heroes , the nature of the world , and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices . It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece . Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization , and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself .   Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives , and implicitly in Greek representational arts , such as vase-paintings and votive gifts . Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world , and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods , goddesses , heroes , heroines and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature .  The oldest known Greek literary sources , Homer 's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias .   Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology , with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes .   Sources   Greek mythology is known today primarily from Greek literature and representations on visual media dating from the Geometric period from c. 900–800 BC onward . In fact , literary and archaeological sources integrate , sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict ; however , in many cases , the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots .   Literary sources   Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature . Nevertheless , the only general mythographical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity was the Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus . This work attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets and provides a grand summary of traditional Greek mythology and heroic legends . Apollodorus of Athens lived from c. 180–125 BC and wrote on many of these topics . His writings may have formed the basis for the collection ; however the `` Library '' discusses events that occurred long after his death , hence the name Pseudo-Apollodorus .   Among the earliest literary sources are Homer 's two epic poems , the Iliad and the Odyssey . Other poets completed the `` epic cycle '' , but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely . Despite their traditional name , the `` Homeric Hymns '' have no direct connection with Homer . They are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so-called Lyric age . Hesiod , a possible contemporary with Homer , offers in his Theogony ( Origin of the Gods ) the fullest account of the earliest Greek myths , dealing with the creation of the world ; the origin of the gods , Titans , and Giants ; as well as elaborate genealogies , folktales , and etiological myths . Hesiod 's Works and Days , a didactic poem about farming life , also includes the myths of Prometheus , Pandora , and the Five Ages . The poet gives advice on the best way to succeed in a dangerous world , rendered"], [86, "Byzantium ( ; Byzántion ) was an ancient Greek colony on the site that later became Constantinople , and later still Istanbul . Byzantium was colonised by the Greeks from Megara in c. 657 BC .   Name   The etymology of Byzantion is unknown . It has been suggested that the name is of Thraco-Illyrian origin , It may be derived from a Thracian or Illyrian personal name , Byzas . Ancient Greek legend refers to a legendary king Byzas , the leader of the Megarean colonists and founder of the city .  The form Byzantium is a Latinization of the original name . Much later , the name Byzantium became common in the West to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire , the `` Byzantine '' Empire , whose capital Constantinople stood on the site of ancient Byzantium . This usage was introduced only in 1555 by the German historian Hieronymus Wolf , a century after the empire had ceased to exist . During the time of the empire , the term Byzantium was restricted to just the city , rather than the empire that it ruled .   History   The European side ( at Seraglio Point ) featured only two fishing settlements : Lygos and Semistra . The origins of Byzantium are shrouded in legend . The traditional legend has it that Byzas from Megara ( a city-state near Athens ) founded Byzantium in 667 BC when he sailed northeast across the Aegean Sea . The tradition tells that Byzas , son of King Nisos ( Νίσος ) , planned to found a colony of the Dorian Greek city of Megara . Byzas consulted the oracle of Apollo at Delphi , which instructed Byzas to settle opposite the `` Land of the Blind '' . Leading a group of Megarian colonists , Byzas found a location where the Golden Horn , a great natural harbour , meets the Bosphorus and flows into the Sea of Marmara , opposite Chalcedon ( modern day Kadıköy ) . He adjudged the Chalcedonians blind not to have recognized the advantages the land on the European side of the Bosphorus had over the Asiatic side . In 667 BC he founded Byzantium at their location , thus fulfilling the oracle 's requirement . Cape Moda in Chalcedon was the first location which the Greek settlers from Megara chose to colonize in 685 BC , prior to colonizing Byzantion on the European side of the Bosphorus under the command of King Byzas in 667 BC .   It was mainly a trading city due to its location at the Black Sea 's only entrance . Byzantium later conquered Chalcedon , across the Bosporus on the Asiatic side .   Byzantium was besieged by Greek forces during the Peloponnesian war . As part of Sparta 's strategy for cutting off grain supplies to Athens , Sparta took the city in 411 BC . The Athenian military later took the city in 408 BC .   After siding with Pescennius Niger against the victorious Septimius Severus , the city was besieged by Roman forces and suffered extensive damage in 196 AD . Byzantium was rebuilt by Septimius Severus , now emperor , and quickly regained its previous prosperity . It was bound to Perinthos during the period of Septimius Severus . The location of Byzantium attracted Roman Emperor Constantine I who , in 330 AD , refounded it as an imperial residence inspired by Rome itself . ( See Nova Roma . ) After his death the city was called Constantinople ( Greek Κωνσταντινούπολις or Konstantinoupolis ) ( `` city of Constantine '' ) .   This combination of imperialism and location would affect Constantinople 's role as the nexus between the continents of Europe and Asia . It was a commercial , cultural , and diplomatic centre . With its strategic position , Constantinople controlled the major trade routes between Asia and Europe , as well as the passage from the Mediterranean Sea to the Black Sea . On May 29 , 1453 , the city fell to the Ottoman Turks , and again became the capital of a powerful state , the Ottoman Empire . The Turks called the city `` Istanbul '' ( although it was not officially renamed until 1930 ) ; the name derives from `` eis-tin-polin '' ( Greek : `` to-the-city '' ) . To this day it remains the largest and most populous city in Turkey , although Ankara is now the national capital .   Emblem   Though associated with the Sassanid Persians and with Mithradates VI Eupator ( who for a time incorporated the city into his empire ) , by the late"], [87, "The military , also called the armed forces , are forces authorized to use deadly force , and weapons , to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens . The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens , and the prosecution of war against another state . The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society , including , the promotion of a political agenda , protecting corporate economic interests , internal population control , construction , emergency services , social ceremonies , and guarding important areas . The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society , through the development of separate infrastructures , which may include housing , schools , utilities , food production and banking .   The profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself . Some of the most enduring images of the classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders . The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC was one of the defining points of Pharaoh Ramesses II 's reign and is celebrated in bas-relief on his monuments . A thousand years later the first emperor of unified China , Qin Shi Huang , was so determined to impress the gods with his military might that he was buried with an army of terracotta soldiers . The Romans were dedicated to military matters , leaving to posterity many treatises and writings as well as a large number of lavishly carved triumphal arches and victory columns .   Etymology and definitions   Issue : Possibly cognate with Thousand , cf . Latin and Romance language root word `` mil- '' )  The first recorded use of the word military in English , spelled militarie , was in 1585 . It comes from the Latin militaris ( from Latin miles meaning `` soldier '' ) but is of uncertain etymology , one suggestion being derived from * mil-it- – going in a body or mass . The word is now identified as denoting someone that is skilled in use of weapons , or engaged in military service or in warfare .   As a noun the military usually refers generally to a country 's armed forces or sometimes , more specifically , to the senior officers who command them . In general it refers to the physicality of armed forces , their personnel , equipment , and physical area which they occupy .   As an adjective military originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering , but it soon broadened to apply to land forces in general and anything to do with their profession . The names of both the Royal Military Academy ( 1741 ) and United States Military Academy ( 1802 ) reflect this . However , at about the time of the Napoleonic Wars , `` military '' began to be used in reference to armed forces as a whole and in the 21st century expressions like `` military service '' , `` military intelligence '' and `` military history '' encompass naval , marine and air force aspects . As such , it now connotes any activity performed by armed force personnel .   History   Military history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts , not just the history of the state militaries . It differs somewhat from the history of war with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology , governments , and geography .   Military history has a number of purposes . One main purpose is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes so as to more effectively wage war in the future . Another is to create a sense of military tradition which is used to create cohesive military forces . Still another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively . Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and oral history of military conflicts ( war ) , their participating armies and navies and , more recently , air forces .   There are two types of military history , although almost all texts have elements of both : descriptive history that serves to chronicle conflicts without offering any statements about the causes , nature of conduct , the ending and effects of a conflict ; and analytical history that seeks to offer statements about the causes , nature , ending and aftermath of conflicts as a means of deriving knowledge and understanding of conflicts"], [88, "The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th century—when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms—until 1707 , when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain .   In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms , united by Æthelstan ( r. 927–939 ) , became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre .   Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066–1154 , Plantagenet 1154–1485 , Tudor 1485–1603 and Stuart 1603–1714 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649–1660 ) .  Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became `` more English in nature '' ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor .   The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327–1377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558–1603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World .   From the accession of James I in 1603 , the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland . Under the Stuarts , the kingdom plunged into civil war , which culminated in the execution of Charles I in 1649 . The monarchy returned in 1660 , but the Civil War established the precedent that an English monarch can not govern without the consent of Parliament , although this concept became legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 .  From this time the kingdom of England , as well as its successor state the United Kingdom , functioned in effect as a constitutional monarchy.The Constitution of the United Kingdom , with the reservation that it is `` uncodified '' , is taken to be based in the Bill of Rights 1689 . On 1 May 1707 , under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707 , the kingdoms of England and Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain .   Name   The Anglo-Saxons referred to themselves as the Engle or the Angelcynn , originally names of the Angles . They called their land Engla land , meaning `` land of the English '' ,  by Æthelweard Latinized Anglia , from an original Anglia vetus , the purported homeland of the Angles ( called Angulus by Bede ) . The name Engla land became England by haplology during the Middle English period ( Engle-land , Engelond ) . The Latin name was Anglia or Anglorum terra , the Old French and Anglo-Norman one Angleterre . By the 14th century , England was also used in reference to the entire island of Great Britain .   The standard title for all monarchs from Æthelstan until the time of King John was ' ( `` King of the English '' ) .

It chronicles the missions of a team of secret government agents known as the Impossible Missions Force ( IMF ) . In the first season , the team is led by Dan Briggs , played by Steven Hill ; Jim Phelps , played by Peter Graves , takes charge for the remaining seasons . A hallmark of the series shows Briggs or Phelps receiving his instructions on a recording that then self-destructs , followed by the theme music composed by Lalo Schifrin .   The series was filmed and financed by Desilu Productions , and aired on the CBS network from September 1966 to March 1973 . The series was reprised in 1988 for two seasons on ABC , retaining only Graves in the cast . It also inspired a series of theatrical motion pictures starring Tom Cruise , beginning in 1996 .   Series overview   The series follows the exploits of the Impossible Missions Force ( IMF ) , a small team of secret agents used for covert missions against dictators , evil organizations and ( primarily in later episodes ) crime lords . On occasion , the IMF also mounts unsanctioned , private missions on behalf of its members .   The identities of the higher echelons of the organization that oversees the IMF are never revealed . Only rare cryptic bits of information are ever provided during the life of the series , such as in the third season mission `` Nicole '' , where the IMF leader states that his instructions come from `` Division Seven '' . In the 1980s revival , it is suggested the IMF is an independent agency of the United States government .   IMF agents   The leader of the IMF is initially Dan Briggs , played by Steven Hill . As an Orthodox Jew , Hill had to leave on Fridays at 4 p.m. to be home before sundown and was not available until after dark the next day . Although his contract allowed for filming interruptions due to religious observances , the clause proved difficult to work around due to the production schedule and as the season progressed , an increasing number of episodes featured little of Briggs . Hill had other problems as well . After cooperatively crawling through dirt tunnels and repeatedly climbing a rope ladder in the episode `` Snowball in Hell , '' in the following episode ( `` Action ! '' ) he balked at climbing a stairway with railings and locked himself in his dressing room . Unable to come to terms with Hill , the producers re-shot the episode without him ( another character , Cinnamon Carter , listened to the taped message , the selected operatives ' photos were displayed in `` limbo '' , and the team meeting was held in Rollin Hand 's apartment ) , and reduced Briggs ' presence in the five episodes left to be filmed to a minimum . As far as Hill 's religious requirements were concerned , line producer Joseph Gantman simply had not understood what had been agreed to . He told author Patrick J . White , `` 'If someone understands your problems and says he understands them , you feel better about it . But if he does n't care about your problems , then you begin to really resent him . Steven Hill may have felt exactly the same way . ''   Hill was replaced without explanation to the audience after the first season by Peter Graves playing the role of Jim Phelps , who remained the leader for the remainder of the original series and in the 1988–1990 revival .   In theory , Briggs and Phelps are the only full-time members of the IMF . As the series was originally conceived , they would form teams made up of part-time agents who came from a variety of professions , choosing their operatives based on the particular skills necessary for the mission . In practice , however ( especially after the first season ) , Briggs and especially Phelps would choose the same core group of three or four agents for every single mission , leading these regulars to be considered de facto full-time IMF agents . Still , many episodes also feature guest stars playing one-time additional agents who have special skills .   The regular agent line-up during the first season consisted of :  * Cinnamon Carter ( Barbara Bain ) , a top fashion model and actress  * Barnard `` Barney '' Collier ( Greg Morris ) , a mechanical and electronics genius"], [90, "Princess Margaret , Countess of Snowdon , ( Margaret Rose ; 21 August 1930 – 9 February 2002 ) , was the younger daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth , and the only sibling of Queen Elizabeth II .   Margaret spent much of her childhood years in the company of her older sister and parents . Her life changed dramatically in 1936 , when her paternal uncle , King Edward VIII , abdicated to marry the twice divorced American Wallis Simpson . Margaret 's father became King , and her older sister became heir presumptive , with Margaret second in line to the throne . During World War II , the two sisters stayed at Windsor Castle , despite suggestions to evacuate them to Canada . During the war years , Margaret was considered too young to perform any official duties , and instead continued her education .   After the war , Margaret fell in love with Group Captain Peter Townsend . In 1952 , Margaret 's father died , her sister became sovereign , and Townsend divorced his first wife . Early the following year , he proposed to Margaret . Many in the government felt that he would be an unsuitable husband for the Queen 's 22-year-old sister , and the Church of England refused to countenance a marriage to a divorced man . Margaret eventually abandoned her plans with him . In 1960 , she accepted the proposal of the photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones , who was created Earl of Snowdon by the Queen . The couple had two children ; they later divorced in 1978 .   Margaret was often viewed as a controversial member of the royal family . Her divorce earned her negative publicity , and she was romantically associated with several men . Her health gradually deteriorated in the final two decades of her life . A heavy smoker for most of her adult life , she had a lung operation in 1985 , a bout of pneumonia in 1993 , and at least three strokes between 1998 and 2001 . She died at King Edward VII Hospital on 9 February 2002 .   Early life   Margaret was born Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret Rose of York on 21 August 1930 at Glamis Castle in Scotland , her mother 's ancestral home , and was affectionately known as ‘ Margot ’ within the royal family . The Home Secretary , J. R. Clynes , was present to verify the birth . The registration of her birth was delayed for several days to avoid her being numbered 13 in the parish register . At the time of her birth , she was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne . Her father was Prince Albert , Duke of York ( later George VI ) , the second son of King George V and Queen Mary . As a grandchild of the Sovereign in the male line , Margaret Rose was styled Her Royal Highness from birth . Her mother was Elizabeth , Duchess of York , the youngest daughter of the 14th Earl and the Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne . The Duchess of York originally wanted the names Ann Margaret , as she explained to Queen Mary in a letter : `` I am very anxious to call her Ann Margaret , as I think Ann of York sounds pretty , & Elizabeth and Ann go so well together . '' King George V disliked the name Ann , but approved of the alternative `` Margaret Rose '' . She was baptised in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 30 October 1930 by Cosmo Lang , the Archbishop of Canterbury . Her godparents were : the Prince of Wales ( her paternal uncle , for whom his brother the Prince George stood proxy ) ; Princess Ingrid of Sweden ( her paternal cousin , for whom another cousin Lady Patricia Ramsay stood proxy ) ; the Princess Victoria ( her paternal great-aunt ) ; the Lady Rose Leveson-Gower ( her maternal aunt ) ; and the Hon David Bowes-Lyon ( her maternal uncle ) .   Margaret 's early life was spent primarily at the Yorks ' residences at 145 Piccadilly ( their town house in London ) or Royal Lodge in Windsor . The Yorks were perceived by the public as an ideal family : father , mother and children , but unfounded rumours that Margaret was deaf and mute were not completely dispelled until Margaret 's first main public appearance at her uncle Prince George 's wedding in 1934 . She was educated alongside her sister , Princess Elizabeth , by their Scottish governess Marion Crawford ."], [91, "Ten-pin bowling is a sport in which a `` bowler '' rolls a bowling ball down a wood-structure or synthetic ( polyurethane ) lane and towards ten pins positioned at the end of the lane . The objective is to score points by knocking down as many pins as possible . Three finger holes are drilled into a traditional bowling ball , and weights vary considerably to make the sport playable for all ages . The pins are arranged in a triangular position by an automated machine . While professional ten-pin bowling tournaments are held in numerous countries , the sport is commonly played as a hobby by millions of people around the world .   In Canada , the United States , United Kingdom and Australia , the game is commonly referred to as just `` Bowling '' . In New England , `` bowling '' is usually referred to as `` ten-pin bowling '' or `` big-ball bowling '' , because of the smaller diameter , lighter weight ball used in the Worcester , Massachusetts-conceived sport of candlepin bowling from 1880 , and the similarly `` small-ball '' sport of duckpin bowling ( conceived in 1895 ) , popular in the Northeast United States , as well as Canada 's own sport of five-pin bowling , all three of which use smaller diameter , lighter weight bowling balls when compared to tenpin bowling , without the necessity for finger holes in them .   Summary   The , 60 ft lane is bordered along its length by semicylindrical channels called `` gutters '' , which are designed to collect errant balls . The overall width of the lane including the channels is . The narrow lane prevents bowling a straight line at the angle required to consistently carry ( knock down ) all ten pins for a strike . Most skillful bowlers will roll a side spinning ( hook shape reaction ) ball to overcome this . A foul line is marked at the end of the lane nearest to the bowler : if any part of a bowler 's body touches the line itself or beyond ( anywhere on the actual lane surface or any adjoining areas including walls and other lanes ) after the ball is delivered , the bowl is a foul and any pins knocked over by that delivery are scored as zero ( 0 ) . The bowler is allowed one shot at a new rack of ten pins if s/he fouled on the first roll of a frame , and if all ten pins are knocked down on this shot , it is scored as a spare . Behind the foul line is an `` approach '' approximately 15 ft long used to gain speed and leverage on the ball before delivering it . 60 ft from the foul line , where the lane terminates , it is joined to a roughly 36 in deep by wide surface of durable and impact-resistant material called the `` pin deck '' , upon which each rack of pins is set .   Play   The bowler is allowed 10 frames in which to knock down pins , with frames one ( 1 ) through nine ( 9 ) being composed of up to two rolls . The tenth frame is composed of up to three rolls : the bonus roll ( s ) following a strike or spare in the tenth ( sometimes referred to as the eleventh and twelfth frames ) are fill ball ( s ) used only to calculate the score of the mark rolled in the tenth . If neither a strike or a spare is achieved in the tenth frame , no bonus roll is awarded .   Bowling has a unique scoring system which keeps track not only of the current pinfall in a frame , but also strikes and spares which allow for the value of subsequent pinfall . Effectively , there are three kinds of marks given in a score ; a strike ( all ten down in the first ball ) , a spare ( all ten down by the second ball ) , and an open ( one or more missed pins still standing after the second ball ) . A strike earns ten points plus the points for the next two balls thrown . ( For example , if a player got a strike then followed with a 7 then 2 , their value for the strike frame would be 10+7+2 , or 19 . ) A spare earns ten points plus the points for the next ball thrown . ( Again , if a player gets a spare then follows it with 7 pins down on"]]
Question and ModContext:[[[0, 'which actor was the fifth doctor who from 1982-1984, and in that role often wore edwardian cricket costume?', "The Sixth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor , the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who . He is portrayed by Colin Baker . Although his televisual time on the series was comparatively brief and turbulent , Baker has continued as the Sixth Doctor in Big Finish 's range of original Doctor Who audio adventures . Within the series ' narrative , the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS , frequently with companions . When the Doctor is critically injured , he can regenerate his body ; in doing so , his physical appearance and personality change . Baker portrays the sixth such incarnation , a flamboyant man in brightly coloured , mismatched clothes whose brash and overbearing personality set him apart from all his previous incarnations .   The Sixth Doctor appeared in three seasons . His appearance in the first of these was at the end of the final episode of The Caves of Androzani which featured the regeneration from the Fifth Doctor and thereafter in the following serial The Twin Dilemma , the end of that season . The Sixth Doctor 's era was marked by the decision of the BBC controller Michael Grade to put the series on an 18-month `` hiatus '' between seasons 22 and 23 , with only one new Doctor Who story , Slipback , made on radio during the hiatus , broadcast as 6 parts ( at 10 minutes each ) on BBC Radio 4 from 25 July to 8 August 1985 , as part of a children 's magazine show called Pirate Radio Four . Alongside `` The Nightmare Fair '' , The Ultimate Evil '' , `` Mission to Magnus '' , `` Yellow Fever and How to Cure It '' , the remaining stories were still under development in a 25-minute episode format after the season was postponed . These were all dropped with the reconception of the season in mid 1985 in favour of a 14 episode story arc called The Trial of a Time Lord . The Sixth Doctor also appeared in the special Dimensions in Time . There are also novels and audio plays featuring the Sixth Doctor , and the character has been visually referenced several times in the revived 2000s production of the show . Realising what he had nearly done , he initially considered going into a hermitlike existence on the planet Titan 3 , only to be caught up in events on the planet Jocanda , after which he resumed his travels ( The Twin Dilemma ) . He encountered many old foes including the Master , Daleks , Cybermen and Sontarans , and even shared an adventure with his own second incarnation in The Two Doctors . He also faced a renegade female Time Lord scientist , the Rani , who was conducting experiments on humans using the Luddite riots as a cover . Before they could discover the reason for this disaster , the TARDIS landed on Thoros Beta . A race from Andromeda had stolen Time Lord secrets and hidden on Earth , so to protect themselves the Time Lords had moved Earth through space , burning the surface in a massive fireball and leaving it as Ravolox . The prosecutor at that trial , the Valeyard , turned out to be a possible future , an evil incarnation of the Doctor himself who was out to steal his remaining lives . He had also edited the Matrix recordings of the Doctor 's travels ; in reality Peri had survived events on Thoros Beta ."]], [[1, 'which beatles offering was first shown on british tv on boxing day 1967?', "The Beatles were an English rock band , formed in Liverpool in 1960 . With members John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era . Rooted in skiffle , beat , and 1950s rock and roll , the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles , ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock , often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways . In the early 1960s , their enormous popularity first emerged as `` Beatlemania '' , but as the group 's music grew in sophistication , led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s .   The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960 , with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player . The core of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers , most notably Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them . They acquired the nickname `` the Fab Four '' as Beatlemania grew in Britain the next year , and by early 1964 became international stars , leading the `` British Invasion '' of the United States pop market . From 1965 onwards , the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the widely influential albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) , Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( 1967 ) , The Beatles ( commonly known as the White Album , 1968 ) and Abbey Road ( 1969 ) . McCartney and Starr , the surviving members , remain musically active . Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980 , and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001 .   According to the RIAA , the Beatles are the best-selling music artists in the United States , with 178 million certified units . They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act . The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 , and all four were inducted individually from 1994 to 2015 . They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks , before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name . Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July . In February 1958 , McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band . The fourteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon , impressing him with his playing , but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young to join them . After a month of Harrison 's persistence , they enlisted him as their lead guitarist . By January 1959 , Lennon 's Quarry Bank friends had left the group , and he began studies at the Liverpool College of Art . The three guitarists , billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs , were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer . Lennon 's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe , who had recently sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar , joined in January 1960 , and it was he who suggested changing the band 's name to Beatals , as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets ."]], [[2, 'which acid has the alternative name ‘spirits of salt’?', "An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron ( proton or hydrogen ion H+ ) , or , alternatively , capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair ( a Lewis acid ) .   The first category of acids is the proton donors or Brønsted acids . Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ .   Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in acid ' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution .   Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid . An example is boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( NH3 ) . Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( H+ ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs . However , hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other Brønsted-Lowry acids can not form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids . Conversely , many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry acids . In modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid .   Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions , or can be dissolved in water , so the Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant .   The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition ; ) from an acid to a base .   Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions . Interestingly , although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids , they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms .   Arrhenius acids   The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions ( H+ ) or protons in 1884 . An Arrhenius acid is a substance that , when added to water , increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water . Note that chemists often write H+ ( aq ) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus , a proton , does not exist alone in water , it exists as the hydronium ion , H3O+ ."]], [[3, "who won the .1995 best actress oscar for her role as sister helen prejean in the film `dead man walking'?", "The Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama was first awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association as a separate category in 1951 .

Transportation is not the only purpose of cruising , particularly on cruises that return passengers to their originating port , with the ports of call usually in a specified region of a continent . There are even `` cruises to nowhere '' or `` nowhere voyages '' where the ship makes 2–3 night round trips without any ports of call .   By contrast , dedicated transport oriented ocean liners do `` line voyages '' and typically transport passengers from one point to another , rather than on round trips . Traditionally , an ocean liner for the transoceanic trade will be built to a higher standard than a typical cruise ship , including high freeboard and stronger plating to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean , such as the North Atlantic . Ocean liners also usually have larger capacities for fuel , food , and other stores for consumption on long voyages , compared to dedicated cruise ships .   Although often luxurious , ocean liners had characteristics that made them unsuitable for cruising , such as high fuel consumption , deep draught that prevented their entering shallow ports , enclosed weatherproof decks that were not appropriate for tropical weather , and cabins designed to maximize passenger numbers rather than comfort ( such as a high proportion of windowless suites ) . The gradual evolution of passenger ship design from ocean liners to cruise ships has seen passenger cabins shifted from inside the hull to the superstructure with private verandas . The modern cruise ships , while sacrificing qualities of seaworthiness , have added amenities to cater to water tourists , and recent vessels have been described as `` balcony-laden floating condominiums '' .   The distinction between ocean liners and cruise ships has blurred , particularly with respect to deployment . Larger cruise ships have also engaged in longer trips such as transoceanic voyages which may not return to the same port for months ( longer round trips ) . Some former ocean liners operate as cruise ships , such as Marco Polo . The only dedicated transatlantic ocean liner in operation as a liner ( as of December 2013 ) is Queen Mary 2 of the Cunard fleet . She also has the amenities of contemporary cruise ships and sees significant service on cruises .   Cruising has become a major part of the tourism industry , accounting for U. The industry 's rapid growth has seen nine or more newly built ships catering to a North American clientele added every year since 2001 , as well as others servicing European clientele . Smaller markets , such as the Asia-Pacific region , are generally serviced by older ships . These are displaced by new ships in the high growth areas .

In 1840 , it began mail delivery to Alexandria , Egypt , via Gibraltar and Malta . The company was incorporated by Royal Charter the same year , becoming the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company .   P & O first introduced passenger cruising services in 1844 , advertising sea tours to destinations such as Gibraltar , Malta and Athens , sailing from Southampton . The forerunner of modern cruise holidays , these voyages were the first of their kind , and P & O Cruises has been recognised as the world 's oldest cruise line . The company later introduced round trips to destinations such as Alexandria and Constantinople . It underwent a period of rapid expansion in the latter half of the 19th century , commissioning larger and more luxurious ships to serve the steadily expanding market ."]], [[5, 'which type of fish is used to make an arbroath smokie?', 'Fish are consumed as food by many species , including humans .   In culinary and fishery contexts , the term fish can also include shellfish , such as molluscs , crustaceans and echinoderms . English does not distinguish between fish as an animal and the food prepared from it , as it does with pig vs. beef . Some other languages do , as in the Spanish peces versus pescado . The modern English word for fish comes from the Old English word fisc ( plural : fiscas ) which was pronounced as it is today . English also has the term seafood , which covers fish found in the seas and oceans as well as other marine life used as food .   Species   Over 32,000 species of fish have been described , making them the most diverse group of vertebrates . In addition , there are many species of shellfish . However , only a small number of species are commonly eaten by humans .   Preparation   Fish can be prepared in a variety of ways . It can be uncooked ( raw ) ( cf . sashimi ) . It can be cured by marinating ( cf . ceviche ) , pickling ( cf . pickled herring ) , or smoking ( cf . smoked salmon ) . Or it can be cooked by baking , frying ( cf . fish and chips ) , grilling , poaching ( cf . court-bouillon ) , or steaming . Many of the preservation techniques used in different cultures have since become unnecessary but are still performed for their resulting taste and texture when consumed .   Nutritional value   `` Fish provides a good source of high quality protein and contains many vitamins and minerals . It may be classed as either whitefish , oily fish , or shellfish . Whitefish , such as haddock and seer , contain very little fat ( usually less than 1 % ) whereas oily fish , such as sardines , contain between 10-25 % . The latter , as a result of its high fat content , contain a range of fat-soluble vitamins ( A , D , E and K ) and essential fatty acids , all of which are vital for the healthy functioning of the body .fao. % 20fish % 20and % 20fish % 20products Fish and fish products ] Chapter 11 in : Small-scale food processing - A guide for appropriate equipment Intermediate Technology Publications , FAO , Rome .   Health benefits   Research over the past few decades has shown that the nutrients and minerals in fish , and particularly the omega-3 fatty acids found in pelagic fishes , are heart-friendly and can make improvements in brain development and reproduction . This has highlighted the role for fish in the functionality of the human body .   Health hazards   Fish is the most common food to obstruct the airway and cause choking . Choking on fish was responsible for about 4,500 reported accidents in the UK in 1998 .   Allergens   A seafood allergy is a hypersensitivity to an allergen which can be present in fish , and particularly in shellfish . Most people who have a food allergy also have a seafood allergy . Allergic reactions can result from ingesting seafood , or by breathing in vapours from preparing or cooking seafood . The most severe seafood allergy reaction is anaphylaxis , an emergency requiring immediate attention .   Biotoxins   Some species of fish , notably the puffer fugu used for sushi , and some kinds of shellfish , can result in serious poisoning if not prepared properly . These fish always contain these poisons as a defense against predators ; it is not present due to environmental circumstances .

Herbaceous plants may be annuals , biennials or perennials .   Annual herbaceous plants die completely at the end of the growing season or when they have flowered and fruited , and they then grow again from seed .   Herbaceous perennial and biennial plants may have stems that die at the end of the growing season , but parts of the plant survive under or close to the ground from season to season ( for biennials , until the next growing season , when they flower and die ) . Examples of herbaceous biennials include carrot , parsnip and common ragwort ; herbaceous perennials include potato , peony , hosta , mint , most ferns and most grasses . By contrast , non-herbaceous perennial plants are woody plants which have stems above ground that remain alive during the dormant season and grow shoots the next year from the above-ground parts – these include trees , shrubs and vines . Others form the main vegetation of many stable habitats , occurring for example in the ground layer of forests , or in naturally open habitats such as meadow , salt marsh or desert .   Some herbaceous plants can grow rather large , such as the Musa genus , to which the banana belongs .

It encompasses scientific research but is not limited to it , with articles nowadays more often published in science magazines than in academic journals . Grouped among the natural sciences , natural history is the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms . So while natural history dates historically from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the mediaeval Arabic world , through to European Renaissance naturalists working in near isolation , today 's field is more of a cross discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences . For example , geobiology has a strong multi-disciplinary nature combining scientists and scientific knowledge of many specialty sciences .   A person who studies natural history is known as a naturalist or natural historian .   Definitions   Pre-twentieth-century   The English term `` natural history '' is a translation of the Latin historia naturalis . Its meaning has narrowed progressively with time , while the meaning of the related term `` nature '' has widened ( see also History below ) . In antiquity , it covered essentially anything connected with nature or which used materials drawn from nature . For example , Pliny the Elder 's encyclopedia of this title , published circa 77 to 79 AD , covers astronomy , geography , man and his technology , medicine and superstition as well as animals and plants .   Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions : the humanities ( primarily what is now known as classics ) and divinity , with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment . The study of nature revived in the Renaissance , and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge , itself divided into descriptive natural history and natural philosophy , the analytical study of nature . In modern terms , natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern physics and chemistry , while natural history included the biological and geological sciences . The two were strongly associated . During the heyday of the gentleman scientists , many people contributed to both fields , and early papers in both were commonly read at professional science society meetings such as the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences – both founded during the seventeenth century .   Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives , such as Linnaeus ' aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden . Similarly , the Industrial Revolution prompted the development of geology to help find useful mineral deposits .   The astronomer , William Herschel was also a natural historian . Instead of working with plants or minerals he worked with the stars . Herschel can be considered a natural historian because he observed the natural world and attempted to understand it .   Post-nineteenth-century   Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources , and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field , creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them . For example , while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study , it can also be defined as a body of knowledge , and as a craft or a practice , in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed .   Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment , as seen in this definition by Marston Bates : `` Natural history is the study of animals and Plants – of organisms . I like to think , then , of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual – of what plants and animals do , how they react to each other and their environment , how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities '' and this more recent definition by D.S ."]], [[8, 'in which sea is the the grenadines island chain?', "A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land . More broadly , `` the sea '' is the interconnected system of Earth 's salty , oceanic waters—considered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions . The sea moderates Earth 's climate and has important roles in the water cycle , carbon cycle , and nitrogen cycle . Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory , the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s . The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including the IHO 's four named oceans ( the Atlantic , Pacific , Indian , and Arctic ) and the Southern Ocean ; smaller , second-order sections , such as the Mediterranean , are known as seas .M .google. p. 112 . Balkema , Leiden . ISBN 90-5410-706-5 . Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5 % by mass , although this can vary in more landlocked waters , near the mouths of large rivers , or at great depths . About 85 % of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride . Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature . Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides , the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun . The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth ( the Coriolis effect ) .   Former changes in the sea levels have left continental shelves , shallow areas in the sea close to land . These nutrient-rich waters teem with life , which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish , but also shellfish , mammals , and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed . The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs . Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales ' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting . Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters : even under enormous depths and pressures , nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem . Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth 's atmosphere ; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea .   The sea is an essential aspect of human trade , travel , mineral extraction , and power generation . This has also made it essential to warfare and left major cities exposed to earthquakes and volcanoes from nearby faults ; and hurricanes , typhoons , and cyclones produced in the tropics . This importance and duality has affected human culture , from early sea gods to the epic poetry of Homer to the changes induced by the Columbian Exchange , from Viking funerals to Basho 's haikus to hyperrealist marine art , and inspiring music ranging from the shanties in The Complaynt of Scotland to Rimsky-Korsakov 's `` The Sea and Sinbad 's Ship '' to A-mei 's `` Listen to the Sea '' . It is the scene of leisure activities including swimming , diving , surfing , and sailing . However , population growth , industrialization , and intensive farming have all contributed to present-day marine pollution . Atmospheric carbon dioxide is being absorbed in increasing amounts , lowering its pH in a process known as ocean acidification . The shared nature of the sea has made overfishing an increasing problem .   Definition   Both senses of sea date to Old English ; the larger sense has required a definite article since Early Middle English . As the term has been applied over time , there are no sharp distinctions between seas and oceans , although seas are smaller and are—with the notable exception of the Sargasso Sea created by the North Atlantic Gyre—usually bounded by land on a smaller scale than multiple continents . Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water , but the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake ."]], [[9, 'which british impresario was noted for his productions of gilbert and sullivan operettas?', "An impresario ( from the Italian impresa , 'an enterprise or undertaking ' ) is a person who organizes and often finances concerts , plays or operas , performing a role similar to that of an artist manager or a film or television producer . The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera , in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s , the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season . The owners of the theatre , usually noble amateurs , charged the impresario with hiring a composer ( until the 1850s operas were expected to be new ) and the orchestra , singers , costumes and sets , all while assuming considerable financial risk . In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce Der Schauspieldirektor ( The Impresario ) . Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer ; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice , where his opera Orlando finto pazzo was followed by numerous others .   Modern use   The traditional term is still used in the entertainment industry to refer to a producer of concerts , tours and other events in music , opera , theatre and even rodeo .   Application of term   The term is occasionally applied to others , such as independent art museum curators and conference organizers who have a leading role in orchestrating events .

With an area of approximately 44 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and a population of 842 , it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population .   It is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ( a type of theocracy ) ruled by the Bishop of Rome – the Pope . The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins . Since the return of the Popes from Avignon in 1377 , they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City , although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere .   Vatican City is distinct from the Holy See ( ) , which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.2 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe . The independent city-state , on the other hand , came into existence in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , which spoke of it as a new creation , not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States ( 756–1870 ) , which had previously encompassed much of central Italy .   Within Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. They feature some of the world 's most famous paintings and sculptures . The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and tourist mementos , fees for admission to museums , and the sale of publications .   Name   The name was first used in the Lateran Treaty , signed on 11 February 1929 , which established the modern city-state . The name is taken from Vatican Hill , the geographic location of the state . `` Vatican '' is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement , Vatica or Vaticum meaning garden , located in the general area the Romans called vaticanus ager , `` Vatican territory '' .   The official Italian name of the city is ' or , more formally , ' , meaning `` Vatican City State '' .   History   Early history   The name `` Vatican '' was already in use in the time of the Roman Republic for a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome . Under the Roman Empire , many villas were constructed there , after Agrippina the Elder ( 14 BC – 18 October AD 33 ) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD . In AD 40 , her son , Emperor Caligula ( 31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41 ; r. 37–41 ) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers ( AD 40 ) that was later completed by Nero , the Circus Gaii et Neronis , usually called , simply , the Circus of Nero .   Even before the arrival of Christianity , it is supposed that this originally uninhabited part of Rome ( the ager vaticanus ) had long been considered sacred , or at least not available for habitation . A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby .   The particularly low quality of Vatican wine , even after the reclamation of the area , was commented on by the poet Martial ( 40 – between 102 and 104 AD ) .

Connor , who gave the term `` ethnonationalism '' wide currency , also discusses the tendency to confuse nation and state and the treatment of all states as if nation states . In Globalization and Belonging , Sheila L.  A state is specifically a political and geopolitical entity , whilst a nation is a cultural and ethnic one . The term `` nation state '' implies that the two coincide , in that a state has chosen to adopt and endorse a specific cultural group as associated with it . `` Nation state '' formation can take place at different times in different parts of the world .   The concept of a nation state can be compared and contrasted with that of the multinational state , city state , empire , confederation , and other state formations with which it may overlap . The key distinction is the identification of a people with a polity in the `` nation state . ''   History and origins   The origins and early history of nation states are disputed . A major theoretical question is : `` Which came first , the nation or the nation state ? '' Scholars such as Steven Weber , David Woodward , and Jeremy Black have advanced the hypothesis that the nation state did n't arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source , nor was it an accident of history or political invention ; but is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in political economy , capitalism , mercantilism , political geography , and geography combined together with cartography and advances in map-making technologies . It was with these intellectual discoveries and technological advances that the nation state arose . For others , the nation existed first , then nationalist movements arose for sovereignty , and the nation state was created to meet that demand . Some `` modernization theories '' of nationalism see it as a product of government policies to unify and modernize an already existing state . Most theories see the nation state as a 19th-century European phenomenon , facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education , mass literacy and mass media . However , historians also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in Portugal and the Dutch Republic .   During the Italian unification , the number of people speaking the Italian language was even lower . The French state promoted the unification of various dialects and languages into the French language . The introduction of conscription and the Third Republic 's 1880s laws on public instruction , facilitated the creation of a national identity , under this theory .   Some nation states , such as Germany or Italy , came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by nationalists , during the 19th century . The sense of common identity was at first a cultural movement , such as in the Völkisch movement in German-speaking states , which rapidly acquired a political significance . In these cases , the nationalist sentiment and the nationalist movement clearly precede the unification of the German and Italian nation states ."]], [[12, 'which creatures are used as croquet balls in the novel ‘alice’s adventures in wonderland’?', "Croquet is a sport that involves hitting plastic or wooden balls with a mallet through hoops ( often called `` wickets '' in the United States ) embedded in a grass playing court .

Regardless when and by what route it reached England and the British colonies in its recognizable form , croquet is , like golf , pall-mall , trucco , and kolven , among the later forms of ground billiards , which as a class have been popular in Western Europe back to at least the Late Middle Ages , with roots in classical antiquity , including sometimes the use of arches and pegs along with and balls and mallets or other striking sticks ( some more akin to modern field hockey sticks ) . it was attested in Cornwall as early as 1283 .   In the book Queen of Games : The History of Croquet , Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet , which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas . This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica , dated 1877 . It is to be observed , that there are two of these arches , that is one at either end of the alley . The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second , and the walk in Saint James 's Park , now called the Mall , received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall , where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime . ''   While the name pall-mall and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere ( France and Italy ) , the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century . Some other early modern sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance ( as in golf ) , however an image in Strutt 's 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game ( balls on ground , hoop , bats and peg ) being played over a , garden-sized distance . The image 's caption describes the game as `` a curious ancient pastime '' , confirming that croquet games were not new in early nineteenth century England .   In Samuel Johnson 's 1755 dictionary , his definition of `` pall-mall '' clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet : `` A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring '' . However , there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game .   The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from Ireland during the 1850s , perhaps after being brought there from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches ."]], [[13, 'usually made of plastic, which transparent instrument, in the shape of a triangle with one angle at ninety degrees, is used for drawing angles on paper?', "A tool is any physical item that can be used to achieve a goal , especially if the item is not consumed in the process . Tool use by humans dates back millions of years , and other animals are also known to employ simple tools .   Tools that are used in particular fields or activities may have different designations such as `` instrument '' , `` utensil '' , `` implement '' , `` machine '' , `` device , '' or `` apparatus '' . The set of tools needed to achieve a goal is `` equipment '' . The knowledge of constructing , obtaining and using tools is technology .

Stone artifacts only date back to about 2. However , a 2010 study suggests the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis ate meat by carving animal carcasses with stone implements .4 million years ago .6 million years in Ethiopia . One of the earliest distinguishable stone tool forms is the hand axe .   Up until recently , weapons found in digs were the only tools of “ early man ” that were studied and given importance .   Tools are the most important items that the ancient humans used to climb to the top of the food chain ; by inventing tools , they were able to accomplish tasks that human bodies could not , such as using a spear or bow and arrow to kill prey , since their teeth were not sharp enough to pierce many animals ' skins . “ Man the hunter ” as the catalyst for Hominin change has been questioned . Based on marks on the bones at archaeological sites , it is now more evident that pre-humans were scavenging off of other predators ' carcasses rather than killing their own food .   Mechanical devices experienced a major expansion in their use in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome with the systematic employment of new energy sources , especially waterwheels . Their use expanded through the Dark Ages with the addition of windmills .   Machine tools occasioned a surge in producing new tools in the industrial revolution . Advocates of nanotechnology expect a similar surge as tools become microscopic in size .   Functions   One can classify tools according to their basic functions :   * Cutting and edge tools , such as the knife , scythe or sickle , are wedge-shaped implements that produce a shearing force along a narrow face . Ideally , the edge of the tool needs to be harder than the material being cut or else the blade will become dulled with repeated use . But even resilient tools will require periodic sharpening , which is the process of removing deformation wear from the edge . Other examples of cutting tools include gouges and drill bits .  * Moving tools move large and tiny items . Many are levers which give the user a mechanical advantage . Examples of force-concentrating tools include the hammer which moves a nail or the maul which moves a stake . These operate by applying physical compression to a surface . In the case of the screwdriver , the force is rotational and called torque . By contrast , an anvil concentrates force on an object being hammered by preventing it from moving away when struck . Writing implements deliver a fluid to a surface via compression to activate the ink cartridge ."]], [[14, 'which semi-aquatic carnivorous mammal of the weasel family has only two living species: the american and the european?', "A weasel is a mammal of the genus Mustela of the family Mustelidae . The genus Mustela includes the least weasels , polecats , stoats , ferrets , and minks . Members of this genus are small , active predators , with long and slender bodies and short legs . The family Mustelidae ( which also includes badgers , otters , and wolverines ) is often referred to as the `` weasel family '' . In the UK , the term `` weasel '' usually refers to the smallest species Mustela nivalis .   Weasels vary in length from 173 to , females being smaller than the males , and usually have red or brown upper coats and white bellies ; Their tails may be from 34 to long .   Weasels feed on small mammals , and have from time to time been considered vermin , since some species took poultry from farms , or rabbits from commercial warrens . They can be found all across the world except for Antarctica , Australia , and neighbouring islands .   Terminology   The English word `` weasel '' was originally applied to one species of the genus , the European form of the least weasel ( Mustela nivalis ) . This usage is retained in British English , where the name is also extended to cover several other small species of the genus . However , in technical discourse and in American usage , the term `` weasel '' can refer to any member of the genus , or to the genus as a whole . Of the 17 extant species currently classified in the genus Mustela , 10 have `` weasel '' in their common names . The American mink and the extinct sea mink were commonly included in this genus as Mustela vison and Mustela macrodon respectively , but in 1999 were moved to the genus Neovison .   1 Europe and northern Asia division excludes China .   Hybrids in this genus include the polecat-ferret hybrid and the polecat-mink hybrid .   Cultural meanings   Weasels have been assigned a variety of cultural meanings .   In Greek culture , a weasel near one 's house is a sign of bad luck , even evil , `` especially if there is in the household a girl about to be married '' , since the animal ( based on its Greek etymology ) was thought to be an unhappy bride who was transformed into a weasel and consequently delights in destroying wedding dresses . In neighboring Macedonia , however , weasels are generally seen as an omen of good fortune .   In early modern Mecklenburg , Germany , amulets from weasels were deemed to have strong magic ; the period between August 15 and September 8 was specifically designated for the killing of weasels .   In Montagne Noire ( France ) , Ruthenia , and the early medieval culture of the Wends , weasels were not meant to be killed .   In North America , Native Americans deemed the weasel to be a bad sign ; crossing its path meant a `` speedy death '' . In English-speaking areas , weasel can be a disparaging term , noun or verb , for someone regarded as sneaky , conniving or untrustworthy . According to the encyclopedia Wakan Sansai Zue from the Edo period , a nate of weasels would cause conflagrations , and the cry of a weasel was considered a harbinger of misfortune . In the Niigata Prefecture , the sound of a nate of weasels making a rustle resembled six people hulling rice , so was called the `` '' , and it was an omen for one 's home to decline or flourish . It is said that when people chase after this sound , the sound stops ."]], [[15, "whose 23rd. piano sonata is known as the 'apassionata'?", "The piano is a musical instrument played using a keyboard , which is a row of keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands . Invented in about 1700 ( the exact date is uncertain ) , the piano is widely employed in classical , jazz , traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances , accompaniment , and for composing and rehearsal . Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones . With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed . The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced .   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments . The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe . During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings . By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key . Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case , soundboard , bridge , and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings .   Invention   The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori ( 1655–1731 ) of Padua , Italy , who was employed by Ferdinando de ' Medici , Grand Prince of Tuscany , as the Keeper of the Instruments ; he was an expert harpsichord maker , and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments ."]], [[16, 'what, generally, is the par on a 300 yard golf hole?', "A golf course is the grounds where the game of golf is played . It comprises a series of holes , each consisting of a teeing ground , a fairway , the rough and other hazards , and a green with a flagstick ( `` pin '' ) and hole ( `` cup '' ) . A standard round of golf consists of eighteen holes . Most courses contain eighteen holes ; some share fairways or greens , and a subset has nine holes , played twice per round . Many private courses are found at country clubs .   Design   Although a specialty within landscape design or landscape architecture , golf course architecture is considered a separate field of study . Some golf course architects become celebrities in their own right , such as Robert Trent Jones , Jr. ; others are professional golfers of high standing and demonstrated appreciation for golf course composition , notably Jack Nicklaus . This is increasingly the case as new courses are more likely to be sited on less optimal land . Bunkers and sand traps are almost always artificial , although other hazards may be natural .   The layout of a fairway follows certain traditional principles , such as the number of holes ( nine and eighteen being most common ) , their par values , and the number of holes of each par value per course . It is also preferable to arrange greens to be close to the tee box of the next playable hole , to minimize travel distance while playing a round , and to vary the mix of shorter and longer holes . Combined with the need to package all the fairways within what is frequently a compact square or rectangular plot of land , the fairways of a course tend to form an oppositional tiling pattern . In complex areas , two holes may share the same tee box , fairway , or even green . Eighteen-hole courses are traditionally broken down into a `` front 9 '' ( holes 1-9 ) and a `` back 9 '' ( holes 10-18 ) . On older courses ( especially links courses , like the Old Course at St. Andrews ) , the holes may be laid out in one long loop , beginning and ending at the clubhouse , and thus the front 9 is referred to on the scorecard as `` out '' ( heading out away from clubhouse ) and the back 9 as `` in '' ( heading back in toward the clubhouse ) . This is partly for the convenience of the players and the club , as then it is easier to play just a 9-hole round , if preferred , or stop at the clubhouse for a snack between the front 9 and the back 9 .   A successful design is as visually pleasing as it is playable . With golf being a form of outdoor recreation , the strong designer is an adept student of natural landscaping who understands the aesthetic cohesion of vegetation , water bodies , paths , grasses , stonework , and woodwork , among other elements .   Par   Most golf courses have only par-3 , -4 , and -5 holes , though some courses include par-6 holes . ( The Ananti CC and the Satsuki golf course in Sano , Japan are the only courses with par 7 holes . Typical distances for the various holes from standard tees are as follows ."]], [[17, 'which south african soldier / statesman fought against the british in the boer war, then on the side of the allies in both world wars, and was instrumental in the founding of the league of nations in 1919?', "The Second Boer War ( , , literally `` Second Freedom War '' ) otherwise known as the Second Anglo-Boer War or the South African War , started on 11 October 1899 and ended on 31 May 1902 . The United Kingdom fought the South African Republic ( Transvaal Republic ) and the Orange Free State . The British war effort was supported by troops from several regions of the British Empire , including Southern Africa , the Australian colonies , Canada , Newfoundland , British India , and New Zealand . The war ended in victory for the British and the annexation of both republics . Both would eventually be incorporated into the Union of South Africa in 1910 .   Name   The conflict is commonly referred to as simply the Boer War , since the First Boer War ( December 1880 to March 1881 ) is much less well known . `` Boer '' was the common term for Afrikaans-speaking settlers in southern Africa at the time . It is also known as the South African War outside South Africa and as the ( Second ) Anglo-Boer War among South Africans . , a war of liberation ) or Engelse oorlog ( `` English War '' ) . In South Africa it is officially called the South African War .   Origins   The complex origins of the war resulted from more than a century of conflict between the Boers and the British Empire , but of particular immediate importance was the question as to which nation would control and benefit most from the very lucrative Witwatersrand gold mines . During the Napoleonic Wars , a British military expedition landed in the Cape Colony and defeated the defending Dutch forces at the Battle of Blaauwberg ( 1806 ) . Many Boers who were dissatisfied with aspects of British administration , in particular with Britain 's abolition of slavery on 1 December 1834 , elected to migrate away from British rule in what became known as the Great Trek . There they established two independent Boer republics : the South African Republic ( 1852 ; also known as the Transvaal Republic ) and the Orange Free State ( 1854 ) . relations , however , remained uneasy .   In 1866 Erasmus Jacobs discovered diamonds at Kimberley , prompting a diamond rush and a massive influx of foreigners to the borders of the Orange Free State . Then in 1886 , an Australian discovered gold in the Witwatersrand area of the South African Republic . Gold made the Transvaal the richest and potentially the most powerful nation in southern Africa ; however , the country had neither the manpower nor the industrial base to develop the resource on its own . This resulted in the number of uitlanders in the Transvaal potentially exceeding the number of Boers , and precipitated confrontations between the earlier-arrived Boer settlers and the newer , non-Boer arrivals .   British expansionist ideas ( notably propagated by Cecil Rhodes ) as well as disputes over uitlander political and economic rights resulted in the failed Jameson Raid of 1895 . Dr. Leander Starr Jameson , who led the raid , intended to encourage an uprising of the uitlanders in Johannesburg . However , the uitlanders did not take up arms in support , and Transvaal government forces surrounded the column and captured Jameson 's men before they could reach Johannesburg ."]], [[18, 'who invented the first practical camera in 1839?', "The history of the camera can be traced much further back than the introduction of photography . Cameras evolved from the camera obscura , and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology , including daguerreotypes , calotypes , dry plates , film , and digital cameras .   Camera obscura   Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura , a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese and ancient Greeks , which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface .   An Arab physicist , Ibn al-Haytham , published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD . He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter . Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images . Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura . In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing .   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them . The earliest cameras were room-sized , with space for one or more people inside ; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce 's time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available . The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685 , though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible . No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce , so the photograph was not permanent , eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it . The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away . One of those photographs has survived . Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide . After exposure in the camera , the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt ( sodium chloride ) . Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process , the calotype , in 1840 . The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus . After focusing , the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped . Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder , uncapped the lens , and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder . Despite this mechanical simplicity , high-quality achromatic lenses were standard . The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called `` instantaneous '' snapshot exposures practical . For the first time , a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity . With daylight and a fast plate or film , a small camera could be hand-held while taking the picture ."]], [[19, 'which actor succeeded marlon brando as head of the corleone family in the godfather films?', "Marlon Brando , Jr. He is credited with bringing a gripping realism to film acting , and is often cited as one of the greatest and most influential actors of all time .

Brando was also an activist for many causes , notably the African-American Civil Rights Movement and various Native American movements .   He initially gained acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams ' play A Streetcar Named Desire , a role that he had originated successfully on Broadway . He received further praise for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront , and his portrayal of the rebel motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture .

At the start of each game , two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play . The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team , known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , towards a set of wooden stumps , in front of which stands one of the batsmen , known as the striker . The striker 's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat , and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs . The other batsman , known as the non-striker , waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler . The bowler 's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman , at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease .   The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball , leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat , and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground . Runs are scored through two main methods : either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary , or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball . If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground , a run-out occurs .   The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) and Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs , to Test cricket , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece . Traditionally , cricketers play in all-white kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours .   Although cricket 's origins are uncertain , it is first recorded in south-east England in the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the mid-19th century . ICC , the game 's governing body , has over 100 members , ten of which are full members who play Test cricket . Women 's cricket , which is organised and played separately , has also achieved international standard . Cricket is the world 's second most popular spectator sport , after association football , and is followed primarily in Australasia , Great Britain and Ireland , the Indian subcontinent , southern Africa and the West Indies .   Etymology   A number of words have been suggested as sources for the term `` cricket '' . In Samuel Johnson 's Dictionary , he derived cricket from `` cryce , Saxon , a stick '' ."]], [[23, 'jimmy wales and larry sanger founded which website in 2001?', "Lawrence Mark `` Larry '' Sanger ( ;  He grew up in Anchorage , Alaska . From an early age he has been interested in philosophy . Most of his philosophical work has focused on epistemology , the theory of knowledge .   He has been involved with various online encyclopedia projects . He is the former editor-in-chief of Nupedia ,  chief organizer ( 2001–02 ) of its successor , Wikipedia , and founding editor-in-chief of Citizendium . From his position at Nupedia , he assembled the process for article development . Sanger proposed implementing a wiki , which led directly to the creation of Wikipedia . Initially Wikipedia was a complementary project for Nupedia . He was Wikipedia 's early community leader and established many of its original policies .   Sanger left Wikipedia in 2002 , and has since been critical of the project . He states that , despite its merits , Wikipedia lacks credibility due to , among other things , a lack of respect for expertise . In October 2006 , Sanger started a somewhat similar encyclopedia to Wikipedia , Citizendium .   Sanger has taught philosophy at Ohio State University and was an early strategist for the expert-authored Encyclopedia of Earth . He has worked on developing educational projects for individuals behind WatchKnowLearn . He has designed a web-based reading program named Reading Bear which aims to teach children how to read . In February 2013 , he attempted to start a news crowdsourcing project named Infobitt ; it ran out of money in mid-2015 without the code being ready to handle a fullscale launch . His father was a marine biologist and his mother cared for the children .  At an early age , he was interested in philosophical topics .   He graduated from high school in 1986 and went off to Reed College , majoring in philosophy . In college he became interested in the Internet and its publishing abilities .  He set up a listserver as a medium for students and tutors to meet up for `` expert tutoring '' and `` to act as a forum for discussion of tutorials , tutorial methods , and the possibility and merits of a voluntary , free network of individual tutors and students finding each other via the Internet for education outside the traditional university setting . One reaction by philosophers to this state of things is to doubt whether the truth about philosophy can ever be known , or whether there is any such thing as the truth about philosophy . But there is another reaction : one may set out to think more carefully and methodically than one 's intellectual forebears .   Sanger received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from Reed College in 1991 , a Master of Arts from Ohio State University in 1995 , and a Doctor of Philosophy from Ohio State University in 2000 . He explained , `` Imagine that education were not delivered but organized and managed in a way that were fully digitized , decentralized , self-directed , asynchronous , and at-a-distance .

The war is also known under other names , such as the Persian Gulf War , First Gulf War , Gulf War I , Kuwait War , First Iraq War , or Iraq War before the term `` Iraq War '' became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War ( also referred to in the U.S. as `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' ) .  The Iraqi Army 's occupation of Kuwait that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation , and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U. Security Council .S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia , and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene . An array of nations joined the Coalition , the largest military alliance since World War II . The great majority of the Coalition 's military forces were from the U.S. , with Saudi Arabia , the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors , in that order .   The war was marked by the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle , principally by the U.S. The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast of images from cameras on board U.S. bombers during Operation Desert Storm .   The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991 , continuing for five weeks . This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces , who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory . Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq , Kuwait , and areas on Saudi Arabia 's border .   Terminology   The following names have been used to describe the conflict itself :  * Gulf War and Persian Gulf War have been the most common terms for the conflict used within western countries . A problem with these terms is that the usage is ambiguous , having now been applied to at least three conflicts : see Gulf War ( disambiguation ) .

The show premiered on NBC on October 11 , 1975 , under the original title NBC 's Saturday Night . The show 's comedy sketches , which parody contemporary culture and politics , are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members . Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest ( who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast ) and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it 's Saturday Night ! Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera .   Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC 's headquarters in the Comcast Building , SNL has aired 808 episodes since its debut , and concluded its forty-first season on May 21 , 2016 , making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States . The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries , including Canada , Spain , Italy , South Korea , Japan , Brazil , and Finland , each meeting with different levels of success . Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers ( 1980 ) and Wayne 's World ( 1992 ) . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of '' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show . In 2000 , it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame . It was ranked tenth in TV Guide `` 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time '' list , and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine 's `` 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME '' . As of 2012 , it has received 156 Emmy nominations , the most received by any TV show . The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship , with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests .

They come in many forms consisting of liquids , powders , gels , and pastes . Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in domestic cooking . Due to its safety and general availability , food coloring is also used in a variety of non-food applications including cosmetics , pharmaceuticals , home craft projects , and medical devices .   Purpose of food coloring   People associate certain colors with certain flavors , and the color of food can influence the perceived flavor in anything from candy to wine . Sometimes the aim is to simulate a color that is perceived by the consumer as natural , such as adding red coloring to glacé cherries ( which would otherwise be beige ) , but sometimes it is for effect , like the green ketchup that Heinz launched in 1999 . Color additives are used in foods for many reasons including :   * Offset color loss due to exposure to light , air , temperature extremes , moisture and storage conditions  * Correct natural variations in color  * Enhance colors that occur naturally  * Provide color to colorless and `` fun '' foods  * Make food more attractive and appetizing , and informative  * Allow consumers to identify products on sight , like candy flavors or medicine dosages   File : Indigo carmine.svg | Indigo carmine , which is blue .

Regulation   Past use and regulation history   The addition of colorants to foods is thought to have occurred in Egyptian cities as early as 1500 BC , when candy makers added natural extracts and wine to improve the products ' appearance . One of the very first food laws , created in Augsburg , Germany , in 1531 , concerned spices or colorants and required saffron counterfeiters to be burned . The adulteration of foods flourished . Heavy metal and other inorganic element-containing compounds turned out to be cheap and suitable to `` restore '' the color of watered-down milk and other foodstuffs , some more lurid examples being :  * Red lead ( Pb3O4 ) and vermillion ( HgS ) were routinely used to color cheese and confectionery . It also caused two deaths when used to color a dessert in 1860 .   Sellers at the time offered more than 80 artificial coloring agents , some invented for dyeing textiles , not foods . Many color additives had never been tested for toxicity or other adverse effects . Historical records show that injuries , even deaths , resulted from tainted colorants .

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural , and military force in Europe .

Under Theodosius I ( r. 379–395 ) , Christianity became the Empire 's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . Finally , under the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610–641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin .   The borders of the Empire evolved significantly over its existence , as it went through several cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Maurice ( r. 582–602 ) , the Empire 's eastern frontier was expanded and the north stabilised . However , his assassination caused the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 , which exhausted the Empire 's resources and contributed to major territorial losses during the Muslim conquests of the seventh century . In a matter of years the Empire lost its richest provinces , Egypt and Syria , to the Arabs .   During the Macedonian dynasty ( 10th–11th centuries ) , the Empire again expanded and experienced the two-century long Macedonian Renaissance , which came to an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . This battle opened the way for the Turks to settle in Anatolia as a homeland .   The Empire recovered again during the Komnenian restoration , such that by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city . However , it was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade , when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 and the territories that the Empire formerly governed were divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms . Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261 , the Byzantine Empire remained only one of several small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence . Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century . The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 finally ended the Byzantine Empire . The term comes from `` Byzantium '' , the name of the city of Constantinople before it became Constantine 's capital . The publication in 1648 of the Byzantine du Louvre ( Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae ) , and in 1680 of Du Cange 's Historia Byzantina further popularised the use of `` Byzantine '' among French authors , such as Montesquieu .

It is a Greek word meaning `` a ground '' , `` a plea '' , `` an opinion '' , `` an expectation '' , `` word '' , `` speech '' , `` account '' , `` to reason '' , but it became a technical term in philosophy beginning with Heraclitus ( ca . 535–475 BC ) , who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge .   Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways . The sophists used the term to mean discourse , and Aristotle applied the term to refer to `` reasoned discourse '' or `` the argument '' in the field of rhetoric . The Stoic philosophers identified the term with the divine animating principle pervading the Universe . Under Hellenistic Judaism , Philo ( c. 20 BC – AD 50 ) adopted the term into Jewish philosophy . 1977. and further identifies Jesus Christ as the incarnate Logos .   Despite the conventional translation as `` word '' , it is not used for a word in the grammatical sense ; instead , the term lexis ( λέξις ) was used .   Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a `` premise . '' She states that , to find the reason behind a rhetor 's backing of a certain position or stance , one must acknowledge the different `` premises '' that the rhetor applies via his or her chosen diction ... between arguer and audience . '' `` Logos is logical appeal , and the term logic is derived from it . It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker 's topic . '' Furthermore , logos is credited with appealing to the audience 's sense of logic , with the definition of “ logic ” being concerned with the thing as it is known .  Furthermore , you can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways : 1 ) through inductive logic , providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement ; 2 ) through deductive enthymeme , providing the audience with general scenarios and then pulling out a certain truth .   Philo distinguished between logos prophorikos ( `` the uttered word '' ) and the logos endiathetos ( `` the word remaining within '' ) . The Stoics also spoke of the logos spermatikos ( the generative principle of the Universe ) , which is not important in the Biblical tradition but is relevant in Neoplatonism . Early translators from Greek , such as Jerome in the 4th century , were frustrated by the inadequacy of any single Latin word to convey the Logos expressed in the Gospel of John . Martin Luther rejected Zeitwort ( verb ) in favor of Wort ( word ) , for instance , although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving the living word as felt by Jerome and Augustine .   Ancient Greek philosophy   Heraclitus   The writing of Heraclitus ( c. 535 – c. 475 BC ) was the first place where the word logos was given special attention in ancient Greek philosophy , although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time ."]], [[32, 'which geological period is named after an ancient tribe which once inhabited south wales?', " He was also a geologist and palaeontologist , writing the first full account of a fossil dinosaur , which he named Megalosaurus . His work proving that Kirkdale Cave had been a prehistoric hyena den , for which he was awarded the Copley Medal , was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct events from the distant past . He was a pioneer in the use of fossilised faeces , for which he coined the term coprolites , to reconstruct ancient ecosystems .   Buckland was a proponent of the Gap Theory that interpreted the biblical account of Genesis as referring to two separate episodes of creation separated by a lengthy period ; it emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a way to reconcile the scriptural account with discoveries in geology that suggested the earth was very old . Early in his career he believed that he had found geological evidence of the biblical flood , but later became convinced that the glaciation theory of Louis Agassiz provided a better explanation , and he played an important role in promoting that theory in Great Britain .   Early life and university   Buckland was born at Axminster in DevonChisholm , 1911 and , as a child , would accompany his father , the Rector of Templeton and Trusham , on his walks where interest in road improvements led to collecting fossil shells , including ammonites , from the Jurassic lias rocks exposed in local quarries . Having taken his BA in 1804 , he went on to obtain his MA degree in 1808 . He then became a Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1809 , was ordained as a priest and continued to make frequent geological excursions , on horseback , to various parts of England , Scotland , Ireland and Wales . As ( unofficial ) curator of the Ashmolean Museum , he built up collections , touring Europe and coming into contact with scientists including Georges Cuvier .   Rejection of flood geology and Kirkdale Cave   In 1818 , Buckland was elected a fellow of the Royal Society . That year he persuaded the Prince Regent to endow an additional Readership , this time in Geology and he became the first holder of the new appointment , delivering his inaugural address on 15 May 1819 . This was published in 1820 as Vindiciæ Geologiæ ; At a time when others were coming under the opposing influence of James Hutton 's theory of uniformitarianism , Buckland developed a new hypothesis that the word `` beginning '' in Genesis meant an undefined period between the origin of the earth and the creation of its current inhabitants , during which a long series of extinctions and successive creations of new kinds of plants and animals had occurred . Thus , his catastrophism theory incorporated a version of Old Earth creationism or Gap creationism . Buckland believed in a global deluge during the time of Noah but was not a supporter of flood geology as he believed that only a small amount of the strata could have been formed in the single year occupied by the deluge .   From his investigations of fossil bones at Kirkdale Cave , in Yorkshire , he concluded that the cave had actually been inhabited by hyaenas in antediluvian times , and that the fossils were the remains of these hyaenas and the animals they had eaten , rather than being remains of animals that had perished in the Flood and then carried from the tropics by the surging waters , as he and others had at first thought ."]], [[33, 'what colour is the cross on the greek flag?', "The flag of Greece ( popularly referred to as the `` sky-blue-white '' or the `` blue-white '' and in Greek : `` Γαλανόλευκη '' or `` Κυανόλευκη '' ) , officially recognised by Greece as one of its national symbols , is based on nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white .

Blue and white have many interpretations , symbolising the colours of the famed Greek sky and sea ( combined with the white clouds and waves ) , traditional colours of Greek clothes in the islands and the mainland , etc .   History   The origins of today 's national flag with its cross-and-stripe pattern are a matter of debate . Every part of it , including the blue and white colours ( see below ) , the cross , as well as the stripe arrangement can be connected to very old historical elements ; however it is difficult to establish `` continuity '' , especially as there is no record of the exact reasoning behind its official adoption in early 1822 .   It has been suggested by some Greek historians that the current flag derived from an older design , the virtually identical flag of the powerful Cretan Kallergis family . This flag was based on their coat of arms , whose pattern is supposed to be derived from the standards of their claimed ancestor , Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas ( 963–969 AD ) . This pattern ( according to not easily verifiable descriptions ) included nine stripes of alternating blue and white , as well as a cross , assumed to be placed on the upper left N.

Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports , with events in butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke , freestyle , and individual medley . In addition to these individual events , Olympic swimmers also participate in relays . Swimmers can also compete in open-water events ( i. swimming in the Ocean ) .   History   Evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has been found , with the earliest evidence dating to Stone Age paintings from around 10000 years ago . In 1538 , Nikolaus Wynmann , a German professor of languages , wrote the first swimming book , The Swimmer or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming ( Der Schwimmer oder ein Zweigespräch über die Schwimmkunst ) .   Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England . In 1828 , the first indoor swimming pool , St George 's Baths was opened to the public . By 1837 , the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools , built around London . The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880 , when the first national governing body , the Amateur Swimming Association , was formed , there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country .   In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming competition in London introduced the front crawl to a Western audience . Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from some South American natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873 , winning a local competition in England . His stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today .   Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel ( between England and France ) , in 1875 . Using the breaststroke technique , he swam the channel in 21 hours and 45 minutes .   Other European countries also established swimming federations ; Germany in 1882 , France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896 . The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna . The world 's first women 's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892 . In 1902 , the Australian Richmond Cavill introduced the front crawl to the Western world . In 1908 , the world swimming association , Fédération Internationale de Natation ( FINA ) , was formed . Women 's swimming was introduced into the Olympics in 1912 . Butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was at first a variant of breaststroke , until it was accepted as a separate style in 1952 .   Competitive swimming   Competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century . The goal of competitive swimming is to break personal or world records while beating competitors in any given event . Swimming in competition should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed .   The practice of reducing exercise in the days just before an important competition is called tapering . Additionally , the `` shave and taper '' method refers to the removal of the top layer of `` dead skin '' , which exposes the newer and richer skin underneath .   Swimming is an event at the Summer Olympic Games , where male and female athletes compete in 16 of the recognized events each . Olympic events are held in a 50-meter pool , called a long course pool .

Tolkien . The story began as a sequel to Tolkien 's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit , but eventually developed into a much larger work . Written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written , with over 150 million copies sold .   The title of the novel refers to the story 's main antagonist , the Dark Lord Sauron , who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth . From quiet beginnings in the Shire , a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside , the story ranges across Middle-earth , following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters , not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins , Samwise `` Sam '' Gamgee , Meriadoc `` Merry '' Brandybuck and Peregrin `` Pippin '' Took , but also the hobbits ' chief allies and travelling companions : the Men Aragorn son of Arathorn , a Ranger of the North , and Boromir , a Captain of Gondor ; Gimli son of Glóin , a Dwarf warrior ; Legolas Greenleaf , an Elven prince ; and Gandalf , a Wizard .   The work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set , the other to be The Silmarillion , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher . The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers , and The Return of the King . Structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume . Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume . The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages . Although a major work in itself , the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917 , in a process he described as mythopoeia . Influences on this earlier work , and on the story of The Lord of the Rings , include philology , mythology , religion and the author 's distaste for the effects of industrialization , as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien 's experiences in World War I . These inspirations and themes have often been denied by Tolkien himself . The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy ;   The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture , the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien 's works , and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works . The Lord of the Rings has inspired , and continues to inspire , artwork , music , films and television , video games , and subsequent literature . In 2003 , it was named Britain 's best-loved novel of all time in the BBC 's The Big Read .   Plot summary   Prologue   Thousands of years before the events of the novel , the Dark Lord Sauron had forged the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power and corrupt those who wore them : the leaders of Men , Elves and Dwarves . Sauron was later vanquished in battle by an alliance of Elves and Men led by Elendil and Gil-galad . Isildur , a ruler of Men , cut the One Ring from Sauron 's finger , claiming it as an heirloom for his line , and Sauron lost his physical form . When Isildur was later ambushed and killed by the Orcs , the Ring was lost in the River Anduin at Gladden Fields ."]], [[36, 'the archaeological site of the ancient city of troy is in which country?', "Troy ( , Troia and , Ilion , or , Ilios ; and ; Trōia is the typical Latin name for the city . ) was a city situated in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor , now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey , near ( just south of ) the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles straits and northwest of Mount Ida . The present-day location is known as Hisarlık . this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city , Wilusa .   A new capital called Ilium was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus . It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople and declined gradually in the Byzantine era .   In 1865 , English archaeologist Frank Calvert excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarlık , and in 1868 , Heinrich Schliemann , a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist , also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in Çanakkale . Schliemann was at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy , but was persuaded by Calvert and took over Calvert 's excavations on the eastern half of the Hisarlik site , which was on Calvert 's property . Troy VII has been identified with the Hittite city Wilusa , the probable origin of the Greek Ἴλιον , and is generally ( but not conclusively ) identified with Homeric Troy .   Today , the hill at Hisarlık has given its name to a small village near the ruins , which supports the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site . It lies within the province of Çanakkale , some 30 km south-west of the provincial capital , also called Çanakkale . The nearest village is Tevfikiye .   Troy was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998 .   Homeric Troy   Ancient Greek historians variously placed the Trojan War in the 12th , 13th , or 14th centuries BC : Eratosthenes to 1184 BC , Herodotus to 1250 BC , Duris of Samos to 1334 BC . Modern archaeologists associate Homeric Troy with archaeological Troy VII .   In the Iliad , the Achaeans set up their camp near the mouth of the River Scamander ( presumably modern Karamenderes ) , where they had beached their ships . Recent geological findings have permitted the identification of the ancient Trojan coastline , and the results largely confirm the accuracy of the Homeric geography of Troy .   In November 2001 , the geologist John C. Kraft from the University of Delaware and the classicist John V. Luce from Trinity College , Dublin , presented the results of investigations , begun in 1977 , into the geology of the region . They compared the present geology with the landscapes and coastal features described in the Iliad and other classical sources , notably Strabo 's Geographia , and concluded that there is a regular consistency between the location of Schliemann 's Troy and other locations such as the Greek camp , the geological evidence , descriptions of the topography and accounts of the battle in the Iliad .   Besides the Iliad , there are references to Troy in the other major work attributed to Homer , the Odyssey , as well as in other ancient Greek literature ( such as Aeschylus ' Oresteia ) . The Homeric legend of Troy was elaborated by the Roman poet Virgil in his Aeneid ."]], [[37, 'in greek mythology, who was the first woman on earth', "Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks , concerning their gods and heroes , the nature of the world , and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices . It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece . Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization , and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself .   Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives , and implicitly in Greek representational arts , such as vase-paintings and votive gifts . Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world , and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods , goddesses , heroes , heroines and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature .  The oldest known Greek literary sources , Homer 's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias .   Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology , with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes . In fact , literary and archaeological sources integrate , sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict ; however , in many cases , the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots .   Literary sources   Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature . Nevertheless , the only general mythographical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity was the Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus . 180–125 BC and wrote on many of these topics . Other poets completed the `` epic cycle '' , but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely . Despite their traditional name , the `` Homeric Hymns '' have no direct connection with Homer . They are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so-called Lyric age . Hesiod , a possible contemporary with Homer , offers in his Theogony ( Origin of the Gods ) the fullest account of the earliest Greek myths , dealing with the creation of the world ; the origin of the gods , Titans , and Giants ; as well as elaborate genealogies , folktales , and etiological myths . Hesiod 's Works and Days , a didactic poem about farming life , also includes the myths of Prometheus , Pandora , and the Five Ages ."]], [[38, 'bunny chow, also known as kota, is a fast-food dish consisting of a hollowed-out loaf filled with curry and is native to which country?', "The cuisine of South Africa can be generalised as :   * Cookery practised by indigenous people of Africa such as the Sotho- and Nguni-speaking people .  * Cookery that emerged from several waves of colonisation and immigration introduced during the colonial period by white European people of Dutch ( since 1652 ) , German , French , Italian , Greek and British ( since 1805~1820 ) descent and their Indo-Asian slaves or servants – this includes the cuisine of the so-called Cape Malay people , which has many characteristics of Indonesia and cooking styles from neighbouring colonial cultures such as Portuguese Mozambique .   Indigenous cookery   In the precolonial period , indigenous cuisine was characterised by the use of a very wide range of foods including fruits , nuts , bulbs , leaves and other products gathered from wild plants and by the hunting of wild game . The introduction of domestic cattle and grain crops by Bantu speakers who arrived in the southern regions from central Africa since 10,000 BC and the spread of cattle keeping to Khoisan groups enabled products and the availability of fresh meat on demand . The pre-colonial diet consisted primarily of cooked grains , especially sorghum , fermented milk ( somewhat like yogurt ) and roasted or stewed meat . People also kept sheep and goats , and communities often organised vast hunts for the abundant game ; but beef was considered the absolutely most important and high status meat . The ribs of any cattle that were slaughtered in many communities were so prized that they were offered to the chief of the village .   In many ways , the daily food of South African families can be traced to the indigenous foods that their ancestors ate . The Sotho-Tswana call this fermented pap , `` ting . ''   The vegetable is often some sort of pumpkin , varieties of which are indigenous to South Africa , although now many people eat pumpkins that originated in other countries . Rice and beans are also very popular even though they are not indigenous . Another common vegetable dish , which arrived in South Africa with its many Irish immigrants , but which has been adopted by South Africans , is shredded cabbage and white potatoes cooked with butter .   For many South Africans meat is the centre of any meal . The Khoisan ate roasted meat , and they also dried meat for later use . As in the past , when men kept cattle as their prized possession in the rural areas , South Africans have a preference for beef . Today , South Africans enjoy not only beef , but mutton , goat , chicken and other meats as a centrepiece of a meal . On weekends , many South African families have a `` braai , '' and the meal usually consists of `` pap and vleis '' , which is maize meal and grilled meat . Eating meat even has a ritual significance in both traditional and modern South African culture .

The city of Springfield itself is home to Springfield College ; Western New England University ; American International College ; and Springfield Technical Community College , among other higher educational institutions .   History   Springfield was founded in 1636 by English Puritan William Pynchon as `` Agawam Plantation '' under the administration of the Connecticut Colony . During its early existence , Springfield flourished as both an agricultural settlement and trading post , although its prosperity waned dramatically during ( and after ) King Philip 's War in 1675 , when natives laid siege to it and burned it to the ground .   The original settlement – today 's downtown Springfield – was located atop bluffs at the confluence of four rivers , at the nexus of trade routes to Boston , Albany , New York City , and Montreal , and with some of the northeastern United States ' most fertile soil . In 1777 , Springfield 's location at numerous crossroads led George Washington and Henry Knox to establish the United States ' National Armory at Springfield , which produced the first American musket in 1794 , and later the famous Springfield rifle . The near-capture of the U. Arsenal at Springfield during Shays Rebellion of 1787 led directly to the formation of the U.S . Constitutional Convention .   During the 19th and 20th centuries , Springfielders produced many innovations , including the first American-English dictionary ( 1805 , Merriam Webster ) ; the first use of interchangeable parts and the assembly line in manufacturing , ( 1819 , Thomas Blanchard ; ) the first American horseless car , ( 1825 , Thomas Blanchard ; ) the discovery and patent of vulcanized rubber , ( 1844 , Charles Goodyear ; ) the first American gasoline-powered car , ( 1893 , Duryea Brothers ) ; the first successful motorcycle company , ( 1901 , `` Indian '' ) ; one of America 's first commercial radio stations , ( 1921 , WBZ , broadcast from the Hotel Kimball ) ; and most famously , the world 's second-most-popular sport , basketball , ( 1891 , Dr. James Naismith ) .

It is one of the three branches of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic , together with the Army and the Air Force . Each ship of the Argentine Navy is designated with the prefix `` ARA '' before its name .   The Argentine Navy day is celebrated on May 17 , anniversary of the victory achieved in 1814 in the Battle of Montevideo over the Spanish fleet during the war of Independence .   History   19th century   The Argentine Navy was created in the aftermath of the May Revolution of May 25 , 1810 , which started the war for independence from Spain . The navy was first created to support Manuel Belgrano in the Paraguay campaign , but it was sunk by ships from Montevideo , and did not take part in that conflict . As Buenos Aires had little maritime history , most men in the navy were from other nations , such as the Irish-born admiral William Brown , who directed the operation . As the cost of maintaining a navy was too high , most of the Argentine naval forces were composed of privateers .   Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata .   In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself . At the close of the century , the force included :   * 5 armoured cruisers  * 4 coastal defence ironclads  * 3 second-class , high-speed , British-built cruisers  * 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats  * 4 destroyers and  * 22 torpedo boats .   The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships : , , and , each at over 6,000 tons .   The navy 's ships were built primarily in Italy , Britain , France , and Spain and were operated by over 600 officers and 7760 seamen . These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery . In 1940 , Argentina 's navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world ( after the European powers , Japan , and the United States ) and the largest in Latin America . The fleet included two First World War-era ( but modernized ) American-built s , three modern cruisers , a dozen British-built destroyers , and three submarines in addition to minelayers , minesweepers , coastal defence ships , and gunboats . A naval air force was also in operation .   In the postwar period , Naval Aviation and Marine Corps units were put under direct Navy command .   The Argentine Navy has been traditionally heavily involved in fishery inspection helping the Coast Guard : most notably in 1966 a destroyer fired on and holed a Soviet trawler that had refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata , in the 1970s there were four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships and continued in recent years .

Invasive species are those introduced species that spreadwidely or quickly and cause harm , be that to the environment , human health , other valued resources or the economy . There have been calls from scientists to consider a species `` invasive '' only in terms of their spread and reproduction rather than the harm they may cause .S.

Early life   Although Smiley has no concrete biography beyond that offered briefly at the beginning of Call for the Dead , le Carré does leave clues in his novels .   Smiley was probably born around 1906 ( or 1915 on the revised chronology ) to middle class parents in the South of England , and attended a minor public school and an antiquated Oxford college of no real distinction ( in the 1982 BBC television adaptation of Smiley 's People , he refers to himself as a fellow of Lincoln College ) , studying modern languages with a particular focus on Baroque German literature . Smiley 's wartime superiors described him as having `` the cunning of Satan and the conscience of a virgin '' .   In 1943 , he was recalled to England to work at Circus headquarters , and in 1945 successfully proposed marriage to Lady Ann Sercomb , a beautiful , aristocratic , and libidinous young lady working as a secretary there . In the same year , Smiley left the Service and returned to Oxford . However , in 1947 , with the onset of the Cold War , Smiley was asked to return to the Service , and in early 1951 moved into counter-intelligence work , where he would remain for the next decade . During that period , Smiley first met his Soviet nemesis , Karla , in a Delhi prison . Karla proved impossible to crack , taking Smiley 's lighter for good measure , a gift to Smiley from wife Ann .

Many fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities , and some are designed as dual-purpose fighter-bombers ; often aircraft that do not fulfill the standard definition are called fighters .

Since World War I , achieving and maintaining air superiority has been considered essential for victory in conventional warfare . The success or failure of a belligerent 's efforts to gain air supremacy hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots , the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters , and the numbers and performance of those fighters . Because of the importance of air superiority , since the dawn of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers , and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces .

Army called their fighters `` pursuit '' aircraft from 1916 until the late 1940s . In most languages a fighter aircraft is known as a hunter , or hunting aircraft ( avion de chasse , jagdflugzeuge , avión de caza etc . Exceptions include Russian , where a fighter is an `` истребитель '' ( pronounced `` istrebitel '' ) , meaning `` exterminator '' , and Hebrew where it is `` matose krav '' ( literally `` battle plane '' ) .   As a part of military nomenclature , a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use , along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft .g . F-35 or Spitfire F. In Russia `` I '' was used ( I-16 ) , while the French continue to use `` C '' ( Nieuport 17 C.1 ) . This has always been the case , for instance the Sopwith Camel and other `` fighting scouts '' of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work . In World War II , the USAAF and RAF often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or dive bombers , and types such as the P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Hurricane that were no longer competitive aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack . Several aircraft , such as the F-111 and F-117 , have received fighter designations but had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons .S. Navy , but it was cancelled . This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for `` attack '' or `` strike '' operations against ground targets by means of strafing or dropping small bombs and incendiaries . Versatile multirole fighter-bombers such as the F/A-18 Hornet are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types .   Some of the most expensive fighters such as the US F-14 Tomcat , F-15 Eagle , F-22 Raptor and Russian Su-27 were employed as all-weather interceptors as well as air superiority fighter aircraft , while commonly developing air-to-ground roles late in their careers . An interceptor is generally an aircraft intended to target ( or intercept ) bombers and so often trades maneuverability for climb rate .   Development overview   Fighters were developed in World War I to deny enemy aircraft and dirigibles the ability to gather information by reconnaissance ."]], [[44, 'in which year did nick faldo win both the open and the us masters championships?', "The Open Championship , often referred to as The Open or the British Open , is the oldest of the four major championships in professional golf . The Open is currently the third major of the year , between the U. Open and the PGA Championship , and is played in mid-July .   The current champion is Henrik Stenson , who won the 145th Open at Royal Troon in 2016 with a record-breaking score of −20 .   History   The Open was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland . The inaugural tournament was restricted to professionals and attracted a field of eight golfers who played three rounds of Prestwick 's twelve-hole course in a single day . Willie Park Sr. won with a score of 174 , beating Old Tom Morris , by two strokes . The following year the tournament was opened to amateurs ; eight of them joined ten professionals in the field .   James Ogilvie Fairlie was the principal organiser of the first Open Championship held at Prestwick in 1860 . In a proposed competition for a `` Challenge Belt '' , Fairlie sent out a series of letters to Blackheath , Perth , Edinburgh , Musselburgh and St Andrews , inviting a player known as a `` respectable caddie '' to represent each of the clubs in a tournament to be held on 17 October 1860 .   Originally , the trophy presented to the event 's winner was the Challenge Belt , a red leather belt with a silver buckle . The Challenge Belt was retired in 1870 , when Young Tom Morris was allowed to keep it for winning the tournament three consecutive times . Because no trophy was available , the tournament was cancelled in 1871 . In 1872 , after Young Tom Morris won again for a fourth time in a row , he was awarded a medal . The present trophy , The Golf Champion Trophy , better known by its popular name of the Claret Jug , was then created . In 1892 the event was doubled in length from 36 to 72 holes , four rounds of what was by then the standard complement of 18 holes . Because of an increasing number of entrants , a cut was introduced after two rounds in 1898 . In 1920 full responsibility for The Open Championship was handed over to The Royal & Ancient Golf Club .   The early winners were all Scottish professionals , who in those days worked as greenkeepers , clubmakers , and caddies to supplement their modest winnings from championships and challenge matches . The Open has always been dominated by professionals , with only six victories by amateurs , all of which occurred between 1890 and 1930 . The last of these was Bobby Jones ' third Open and part of his celebrated Grand Slam . Jones was one of six Americans who won The Open between the First and Second World Wars , the first of whom had been Walter Hagen in 1922 .   The first post-World War II winner was the American Sam Snead , in 1946 . In 1947 , Northern Ireland 's Fred Daly was victorious . There has never been a Welsh champion . In the early postwar years The Open was dominated by golfers from the Commonwealth , with South African Bobby Locke and Australian Peter Thomson winning the Claret Jug in eight of the 11 championships from 1948 and 1958 between them ."]], [[45, "what is the title of tony blair's autobiography/memoir published in 2010, which covered events from 1994 to his resignation as prime minister?", "Anthony Charles Lynton Blair ( born 6 May 1953 ) is a British politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007 and the Leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007 .   From 1983 to 2007 , Blair was the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994 , following the sudden death of his predecessor , John Smith . Under Blair 's leadership , the party used the phrase `` New Labour '' , to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism . Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as `` social-ism '' , involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent , and advocated social justice , cohesion , equal worth of each citizen , and equal opportunity . Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism .   In May 1997 , the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory , the largest in its history , allowing Blair , at 43 years old , to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812 . In September 1997 , Blair attained early personal popularity , receiving a 93 % public approval rating , after his public response to the death of Diana , Princess of Wales . In the first years of the New Labour government , Blair 's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act , Human Rights Act , and Freedom of Information Act . Blair 's government also carried out the devolution , the establishing of the Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales , and the Northern Ireland Assembly , thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto . In Northern Ireland , Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement .   Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W. Blair has faced strong criticism for his role in the invasion of Iraq , including calls for having him tried for war crimes and waging a war of aggression . In 2016 the Iraq Inquiry strongly criticised his actions and described the invasion of Iraq as unjustified and unnecessary .   Blair was succeeded as the leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007 , and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown . On the day that Blair resigned as Prime Minister , he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East , which he held until 27 May 2015 . He now runs a consultancy business and has set up various foundations in his own name , including the Tony Blair Faith Foundation .

Traditionally , throughout the 20th century and into the 21st , these have been published in newspapers and magazines , with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers , while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections . With the development of the internet , they began to appear online as web comics .   Strips are written and drawn by a comics artist or cartoonist . As the name implies , comic strips can be humorous ( for example , `` gag-a-day '' strips such as Blondie , Bringing Up Father , Marmaduke , and Pearls Before Swine ) .   Starting in the late 1920s , comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories , as seen in Popeye , Captain Easy , Buck Rogers , Tarzan , and The Adventures of Tintin . Soap-opera continuity strips such as Judge Parker and Mary Worth gained popularity in the 1940s . All are called , generically , comic strips , though cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that `` sequential art '' would be a better genre-neutral name .   In the UK and the rest of Europe , comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines , with a strip 's story sometimes continuing over three pages or more . Comic strips have appeared in American magazines such as Liberty and Boys ' Life and also on the front covers of magazines , such as the Flossy Frills series on The American Weekly Sunday newspaper supplement . Printed examples emerged in 19th-century Germany and in 18th-century England , where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced .   The Biblia pauperum ( `` Paupers ' Bible '' ) , a tradition of picture Bibles beginning in the later Middle Ages , sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the miniatures written on scrolls coming out of their mouths—which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips .   Newspapers   The first newspaper comic strips appeared in North America in the late 19th century . However , the art form combining words and pictures developed gradually and there are many examples which led up to the comic strip .   Swiss author and caricature artist Rodolphe Töpffer ( Geneva , 1799–1846 ) is considered the father of the modern comic strips . His illustrated stories such as Histoire de M. Vieux Bois ( 1827 ) , first published in the USA in 1842 as The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck or Histoire de Monsieur Jabot ( 1831 ) , inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists . In 1865 , German painter , author , and caricaturist Wilhelm Busch created the strip Max and Moritz , about two trouble-making boys , which had a direct influence on the American comic strip . in one , the boys , after perpetrating some mischief , are tossed into a sack of grain , run through a mill , and consumed by a flock of geese . Max and Moritz provided an inspiration for German immigrant Rudolph Dirks , who created the Katzenjammer Kids in 1897 . Familiar comic-strip iconography such as stars for pain , sawing logs for snoring , speech balloons , and thought balloons originated in Dirks ' strip .   Hugely popular , Katzenjammer Kids occasioned one of the first comic-strip copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium ."]], [[47, 'perhaps foreshadowing recent events in ukraine, over what region of the southern caucasus did russia and georgia go to war in 2008?', "Georgia ( ; , tr .

The capital and largest city is Tbilisi .75 million . Georgia is a unitary , semi-presidential republic , with the government elected through a representative democracy .   During the classical era , several independent kingdoms became established in what is now Georgia . The kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia adopted Christianity in the early 4th century . A unified Kingdom of Georgia reached the peak of its political and economic strength during the reign of King David IV and Queen Tamar in the 11th–12th centuries . Thereafter the area was dominated by various large empires for centuries , including the Mongols , the Ottoman Empire , and successive dynasties of Iran . In the late 18th century , the kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti forged an alliance with the Russian Empire , and the area was annexed by Russia in 1801 . The latter 's rule over Georgia was confirmed in 1813 through the Treaty of Gulistan with Qajar Iran . Following the Russian Revolution in 1917 , Georgia obtained independence , though only briefly , and established its first-ever republic under German and British protection , only to be invaded by Soviet Russia in 1921 and subsequently absorbed into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic .   After restoring its independence once again in 1991 , post-communist Georgia suffered from civil and economic crisis for most of the 1990s . This lasted until the peaceful Rose Revolution , when Georgia pursued a strongly pro-Western foreign policy , introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at NATO and European integration . The country 's Western orientation soon led to the worsening of relations with Russia , culminating in the brief Russo-Georgian War .   Georgia is a member of the Council of Europe and the GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development . It contains two de facto independent regions , Abkhazia and South Ossetia , which gained limited international recognition after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War .

It is bounded to the northeast by Kazakhstan , to the northwest by Russia , to the west by Azerbaijan , to the south by Iran , and to the southeast by Turkmenistan .   The Caspian Sea lies to the east of the Caucasus Mountains and to the west of the vast steppe of Central Asia . Its northern part , the Caspian Depression , is one of the lowest points on Earth . The ancient inhabitants of its coast perceived the Caspian Sea as an ocean , probably because of its saltiness and large size .   The sea has a surface area of ( not including its detached lagoon of Garabogazköl Aylagy ) and a volume of .   Etymology   The word Caspian is derived from the name of the Caspi , an ancient people who lived to the southwest of the sea in Transcaucasia . Strabo wrote that `` to the country of the Albanians belongs also the territory called Caspiane , which was named after the Caspian tribe , as was also the sea ; but the tribe has now disappeared '' . Moreover , the Caspian Gates , which is the name of a region in Iran 's Tehran province , possibly indicates that they migrated to the south of the sea . In fact , the traditional Arabic name for the sea itself is Bahr al-Qazwin ( Sea of Qazvin ) .   In classical antiquity among Greeks and Persians it was called the Hyrcanian Ocean . In Persian antiquity , as well as in modern Iran , it is known as the , Daryā-e Khazar ; it is also sometimes referred to as Mazandaran Sea ( ) in Iran .

During warm and dry climatic periods , the landlocked sea almost dried up , depositing evaporitic sediments like halite that were covered by wind-blown deposits and were sealed off as an evaporite sink when cool , wet climates refilled the basin . ( Comparable evaporite beds underlie the Mediterranean . ) Due to the current inflow of fresh water , the Caspian Sea is a freshwater lake in its northern portions . It is more saline on the Iranian shore , where the catchment basin contributes little flow . Currently , the mean salinity of the Caspian is one third that of Earth 's oceans . The Garabogazköl embayment , which dried up when water flow from the main body of the Caspian was blocked in the 1980s but has since been restored , routinely exceeds oceanic salinity by a factor of 10 .

Under the name of Dundee City , it forms one of the 32 council areas used for local government in Scotland .   Historically part of Angus , the city developed into a burgh in medieval times , and expanded rapidly in the 19th century largely due to the jute industry . This , along with its other major industries gave Dundee its epithet as city of `` jute , jam and journalism '' . Dundee 's recorded population reached a peak of 182,204 at the 1971 census . Biomedical and technological industries have arrived since the 1980s , and the city now accounts for 10 % of the United Kingdom 's digital-entertainment industry .

The situation of the town and its promotion by Earl David as a trading centre led to a period of prosperity and growth . The town became a Royal Burgh on John 's coronation as king in 1292 . The town and its castle were occupied by English forces for several years during the First War of Independence and recaptured by Robert the Bruce in early 1312 . The original Burghal charters were lost during the occupation and subsequently renewed by Bruce in 1327 .   The burgh suffered considerably during the conflict known as the Rough Wooing of 1543 to 1550 , and was occupied by the English forces of Andrew Dudley from 1547 . In 1645 , during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms , Dundee was again besieged , this time by the Royalist Marquess of Montrose . The town was finally destroyed by Parliamentarian forces led by George Monck in 1651 . The town played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Jacobite cause when John Graham of Claverhouse , 1st Viscount Dundee raised the Stuart standard on the Dundee Law in 1689 . The town was held by the Jacobites in the 1715–16 rising , and on 6 January 1716 the Jacobite claimant to the throne , James VIII and III ( the Old Pretender ) , made a public entry into the town .

History   The history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods : first , its prehistory , in which the first human settlers arrived , developed agriculture , and made contact with peoples to the north ; the second , the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-African , and extra-African trade , and developed centralized states ; and fifth , the post-independence era , in which the current nations were formed .C , as well as the domestication of cattle . By 1500 B.C , ironworking technology allowed an expansion of agricultural productivity , and the first city-states later formed . Northern tribes developed walled settlements and non-walled settlements that numbered at 400 . In the forest region , Iron Age cultures began to flourish , and an inter-region trade began to appear .   The domestication of the camel allowed the development of a trans-Saharan trade with cultures across the Sahara , including Carthage and the Berbers ; major exports included gold , cotton cloth , metal ornaments and leather goods , which were then exchanged for salt , horses , textiles , and other such materials .   Empires   The development of the region 's economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form , beginning with the Nok culture that began in 1000 B.C . and the Ghana Empire that first flourished between the 1st and 3rd centuries , which later gave way to the Mali Empire . In current-day Mauritania , there exist archaeological sites in the towns of Tichit and Oualata that were initially constructed around 2000 B.C. , and were found to have originated from the Soninke branch of the Mandé peoples . Also , based on the archaeology of city of Kumbi Saleh in modern-day Mauritania , the Mali empire came to dominate much of the region until its defeat by Almoravid invaders in 1052 .   The Sosso Empire sought to fill the void , but was defeated ( c. 1240 ) by the Mandinka forces of Sundiata Keita , founder of the new Mali Empire . The Mali Empire continued to flourish for several centuries , most particularly under Sundiata 's grandnephew Musa I , before a succession of weak rulers led to its collapse under Mossi , Tuareg and Songhai invaders . In the 15th century , the Songhai would form a new dominant state based on Gao , in the Songhai Empire , under the leadership of Sonni Ali and Askia Mohammed .   Meanwhile , south of the Sudan , strong city states arose in Igboland , such as the 10th-century Kingdom of Nri , which helped birth the arts and customs of the Igbo people , Bono in the 12th century , which eventually culminated in the formation the all-powerful Akan Empire of Ashanti , while Ife and Benin City rose to prominence around the 14th century . Further east , Oyo arose as the dominant Yoruba state and the Aro Confederacy as a dominant Igbo state in modern-day Nigeria .   Slavery and European contact   Portuguese traders began establishing settlements along the coast in 1445 , followed by the French , English Spanish Danish and Dutch ; the African slave trade began not long after , which over the following centuries would debilitate the region 's economy and population .

The greater the number of beats per minute , the smaller the amount of time between successive beats , and thus faster a piece must be played .5 seconds . 523 .   With the advent of modern electronics , bpm became an extremely precise measure .   Instead of beats per minute , some 20th-century composers ( e.g. , Béla Bartók , Alberto Ginastera , and John Cage ) specify the total playing time for a piece , from which the performer can derive tempo .   Tempo is as crucial in contemporary music as it is in classical . In electronic dance music , accurate knowledge of a tune 's bpm is important to DJs for the purposes of beatmatching .   Musical vocabulary for tempo   Some musical pieces do not have a mathematical time indication . In classical music it is customary to describe the tempo of a piece by one or more words . Most of these words are Italian , because many of the most important composers of the 17th century were Italian , and this period was when tempo indications were first used extensively and codified .   Before the metronome , it was difficult to specify the tempo of a composition ; Yet , after the metronome 's invention , musicians continued to use these words , often additionally indicating the mood of the piece . This blurred the traditional distinction between tempo and mood indicators . For example , presto and allegro both indicate a speedy execution ( presto being faster ) , but allegro also connotes joy ( from its original meaning in Italian ) . Presto , on the other hand , simply indicates speed . Additional Italian words also indicate tempo and mood . For example , the `` agitato '' in the Allegro agitato of the last movement of George Gershwin 's piano concerto in F has both a tempo indication ( undoubtedly faster than a usual Allegro ) and a mood indication ( `` agitated '' ) ."]], [[54, 'which british sculptor is famed for simple geometric shapes carved in wood, stone, bronze and alabaster, such as pierced form and four square?', "Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions . It is one of the plastic arts . Durable sculptural processes originally used carving ( the removal of material ) and modelling ( the addition of material , as clay ) , in stone , metal , ceramics , wood and other materials but , since Modernism , there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process .   Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials , and often represents the majority of the surviving works ( other than pottery ) from ancient cultures , though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely . However , most ancient sculpture was brightly painted , and this has been lost .   Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures , and until recent centuries large sculptures , too expensive for private individuals to create , were usually an expression of religion or politics . Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean , India and China , as well as many in South America and Africa .   The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece , and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period . During the Middle Ages , Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith . The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo 's David . Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body , with the making of constructed sculpture , and the presentation of found objects as finished art works .   Types of sculpture   A basic distinction is between sculpture in the round , free-standing sculpture , such as statues , not attached ( except possibly at the base ) to any other surface , and the various types of relief , which are at least partly attached to a background surface . Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large figure groups and narrative subjects , which are difficult to accomplish in the round , and is the typical technique used both for architectural sculpture , which is attached to buildings , and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects , as in much pottery , metalwork and jewellery . Relief sculpture may also decorate steles , upright slabs , usually of stone , often also containing inscriptions . many of these allow the production of several copies .   The term `` sculpture '' is often used mainly to describe large works , which are sometimes called monumental sculpture , meaning either or both of sculpture that is large , or that is attached to a building .   The very large or `` colossal '' statue has had an enduring appeal since antiquity ; the largest on record at 128 m is the 2002 Chinese Spring Temple Buddha . Another grand form of portrait sculpture is the equestrian statue of a rider on horse , which has become rare in recent decades . The smallest forms of life-size portrait sculpture are the `` head '' , showing just that , or the bust , a representation of a person from the chest up . Small forms of sculpture include the figurine , normally a statue that is no more than 18 in tall , and for reliefs the plaquette , medal or coin ."]], [[55, 'who was the first member of the british royal family to lie in state at westminster hall?', "Mary of Teck ( Victoria Mary Augusta Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes ; 26 May 1867 – 24 March 1953 ) was Queen consort of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions , and Empress consort of India , as the wife of King-Emperor George V .   Although technically a princess of Teck , in the Kingdom of Württemberg , she was born and raised in England . She was informally known as `` May '' , after her birth month . At the age of 24 she was betrothed to Prince Albert Victor , Duke of Clarence and Avondale , the eldest son of the Prince of Wales , but six weeks after the announcement of the engagement he died unexpectedly of pneumonia . The following year she became engaged to Albert Victor 's next surviving brother , George , who subsequently became King .   As queen consort from 1910 , she supported her husband through the First World War , his ill health and major political changes arising from the aftermath of the war and the rise of socialism and nationalism . After George 's death in 1936 , she became queen mother when her eldest son , Edward , ascended the throne , but to her dismay he abdicated later the same year in order to marry twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson . She supported her second son , Albert , who succeeded to the throne as George VI , until his death in 1952 . She died the following year , during the reign of her granddaughter Queen Elizabeth II , who had not yet been crowned .   Early life   Princess Victoria Mary ( `` May '' ) of Teck was born on 26 May 1867 at Kensington Palace , London . Her father was Prince Francis , Duke of Teck , the son of Duke Alexander of Württemberg by his morganatic wife , Countess Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde . Her mother was Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge , the third child and younger daughter of Prince Adolphus , Duke of Cambridge , and Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel . She was baptised in the Chapel Royal of Kensington Palace on 27 July 1867 by Charles Thomas Longley , Archbishop of Canterbury , and her three godparents were Queen Victoria , the Prince of Wales ( later King Edward VII and May 's future father-in-law ) , and Princess Augusta , the Duchess of Cambridge . Before she became Queen , she was known to her family , friends and the public by the diminutive name of `` May '' , after her birth month . 66 She was the eldest of four children , the only girl , and `` learned to exercise her native discretion , firmness and tact '' by resolving her three younger brothers ' petty boyhood squabbles . They played with their cousins , the children of the Prince of Wales , who were similar in age . May was educated at home by her mother and governess ( as were her brothers until they were sent to boarding schools ) . The Duchess of Teck spent an unusually long time with her children for a lady of her time and class , and enlisted May in various charitable endeavours , which included visiting the tenements of the poor .   Although her mother was a grandchild of King George III , May was only a minor member of the British Royal Family . Her father , the Duke of Teck , had no inheritance or wealth , and carried the lower royal style of Serene Highness because his parents ' marriage was morganatic .

In 1885 , the Tecks returned to London , and took up residence at White Lodge , in Richmond Park ."]], [[56, 'name the earliest (post-gamete) developmental stage of the human embryo?', "An embryo is a multicellular diploid eukaryote in an early stage of embryogenesis , or development . In general , in organisms that reproduce sexually , an embryo develops from a zygote , the single cell resulting from the fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell . The result of this process is an embryo .   In humans , a pregnancy is generally considered to be in the embryonic stage of development between the fifth and the eleventh weeks after fertilization , and is considered a fetus from the twelfth week on .   Etymology   First attested in English in the mid-14c. , the word embryon derives from Medieval Latin embryo , itself from Greek ( embruon ) , lit . the proper Latinized form of the Greek term would be embryum . The blastula stage typically features a fluid-filled cavity , the blastocoel , surrounded by a sphere or sheet of cells , also called blastomeres . In a placental mammal , an ovum is fertilized in a fallopian tube through which it travels into the uterus . An embryo is called a fetus at a more advanced stage of development and up until birth or hatching . In humans , this is from the eleventh week of gestation . e. one would refer to a chick embryo , not a `` chick fetus , '' even at later stages .   During gastrulation the cells of the blastula undergo coordinated processes of cell division , invasion , and/or migration to form two ( diploblastic ) or three ( triploblastic ) tissue layers . In triploblastic organisms , the three germ layers are called endoderm , ectoderm , and mesoderm . The position and arrangement of the germ layers are highly species-specific , however , depending on the type of embryo produced . In vertebrates , a special population of embryonic cells called the neural crest has been proposed as a `` fourth germ layer '' , and is thought to have been an important novelty in the evolution of head structures .   During organogenesis , molecular and cellular interactions between germ layers , combined with the cells ' developmental potential , or competence to respond , prompt the further differentiation of organ-specific cell types . For example , in neurogenesis , a subpopulation of ectoderm cells is set aside to become the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral nerves . Modern developmental biology is extensively probing the molecular basis for every type of organogenesis , including angiogenesis ( formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones ) , chondrogenesis ( cartilage ) , myogenesis ( muscle ) , osteogenesis ( bone ) , and many others . this general observation is sometimes summarized by the phrase `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' . For example , the backbone is a common structure among all vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , and mammals , and the backbone also appears as one of the earliest structures laid out in all vertebrate embryos . The cerebrum in humans , which is the most sophisticated part of the brain , develops last . This sequencing rule is not absolute , but it is recognized as being partly applicable to development of the human embryo .   Plant embryos   In botany , a seed plant embryo is part of a seed , consisting of precursor tissues for the leaves , stem ( see hypocotyl ) , and root ( see radicle ) , as well as one or more cotyledons . Once the embryo begins to germinate — grow out from the seed — it is called a seedling ( plantlet ) .   Bryophytes and ferns also produce an embryo , but do not produce seeds ."]], [[57, 'which scottish engineer gave the first public demonstration of tv?', "John Logie Baird FRSE ( ; 14 August 1888 - 14 June 1946 ) was a Scottish engineer , innovator , one of the inventors of the mechanical television , demonstrating the first working television system on 26 January 1926 , and inventor of both the first publicly demonstrated colour television system , and the first purely electronic colour television picture tube .   In 1928 the Baird Television Development Company achieved the first transatlantic television transmission . Baird 's early technological successes and his role in the practical introduction of broadcast television for home entertainment have earned him a prominent place in television 's history .   Baird was ranked number 44 in the BBC 's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote in 2002 . In 2006 , Baird was named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history , having been listed in the National Library of Scotland 's 'Scottish Science Hall of Fame ' .   Early years   Baird was born on 14 August 1888 in Helensburgh , Dunbartonshire , and was the youngest of four children of the Reverend John Baird , the Church of Scotland 's minister for the local St Bride 's Church and Jessie Morrison Inglis , the orphaned niece of a wealthy family of shipbuilders from Glasgow .   He was educated at Larchfield Academy ( now part of Lomond School ) in Helensburgh ; the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College ; The conditions in industrial Glasgow at the time helped form his socialist convictions but also contributed to his ill health . His degree course was interrupted by the First World War and he never returned to graduate . At the beginning of 1915 he volunteered for service in the British Army but was classified as unfit for active duty . Unable to go to the Front , he took a job with the Clyde Valley Electrical Power Company , which was engaged in munitions work .   Television experiments   The development of television was the result of work by many inventors . Among them , Baird was a prominent pioneer and made major advances in the field .   Between 1902 and 1907 , Arthur Korn invented and built the first successful signal-conditioning circuits for image transmission . The circuits overcame the image-destroying lag effect that is part of selenium photocells . Korn 's compensation circuit allowed him to send still fax pictures by telephone or wireless between countries and even over oceans , while his circuit operated without benefit of electronic amplification . Korn 's success at transmitting halftone still images suggested that such compensation circuits might work in television . Baird was the direct beneficiary of Korn 's research and success . Paul Gottlieb Nipkow had invented this scanning disc system in 1884.Albert Abramson , The History of Television , 1880 to 1941 , McFarland , 1987 , pp . Television historian Albert Abramson calls Nipkow 's patent `` the master television patent '' . Nipkow 's work is important because Baird and many others chose to develop it into a broadcast medium .   In early 1923 , and in poor health , Baird moved to 21 Linton Crescent , Hastings , on the south coast of England . Baird built what was to become the world 's first working television set using items including an old hatbox and a pair of scissors , some darning needles , a few bicycle light lenses , a used tea chest , and sealing wax and glue that he purchased . In February 1924 , he demonstrated to the Radio Times that a semi-mechanical analogue television system was possible by transmitting moving silhouette images . In July of the same year , he received a 1000-volt electric shock , but survived with only a burnt hand , and as a result his landlord , Mr Tree , asked him to vacate the premises ."]], [[58, 'former tennis player vijay armitrage apears in which james bond film?', "Octopussy ( 1983 ) is the thirteenth entry in the Eon Productions James Bond film series , and the sixth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond .

( sometimes informally known as Millionaire ) is an international television game show franchise of British origin , created by David Briggs , Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight . In its format , currently owned and licensed by Sony Pictures Television , large cash prizes are offered for correctly answering a series of multiple-choice questions of increasing ( or , in some cases , random ) difficulty . The maximum cash prize ( in the original British version ) was one million pounds . Most international versions offer a top prize of one million units of the local currency ; The show 's format is a twist on the game show genre—only one contestant plays at a time ( similar to some radio quizzes ) , and the emphasis is on suspense rather than speed . In most versions there are no time limits to answer the questions , and contestants are given the question before they must decide whether to attempt an answer .   Gameplay   Original rules   The contestants must first play a preliminary round , called `` Fastest Finger First '' ( or , in the U.S. The contestant who does so correctly and in the fastest time goes on to play the main game for the maximum possible prize ( often a million units of the local currency ) . In the event that two or more contestants are tied for the fastest time , those contestants play another question to break the tie . If no one gets the question right , that question is discarded and another question is played in the same manner . If any contestants are visually impaired , the host reads the question and four choices all at once , then repeats the choices after the music begins .   Main game contestants are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host . The 'D ' answer on the first question ( except in the Shuffle format like in the US version ) is always incorrect and humorous . Upon answering a question correctly , the contestant wins a certain amount of money . In most versions , there is no time limit to answer a question ; a contestant may ( and often does ) take as long as they need to ponder an answer . After the first few questions , the host will ask the contestant if that is their `` final answer '' . When a contestant says `` final '' in conjunction with one of the answers , it is official , and can not be changed . The first five questions usually omit this rule , because the questions are generally so easy that requiring a final answer would significantly slow the game down ; thus , there are five chances for the contestant to leave with no money if they were to provide a wrong answer before obtaining the first guaranteed amount ; going for 1,000 units of currency after winning 500 units is the last point in the game at which a contestant can still leave empty-handed .   Subsequent questions are played for increasingly large sums , roughly doubling at each turn . The first few questions often have some joke answers . On episodes of the UK version aired between 1998 and 2007 , the payout structure was as follows : first going from £100 to £300 in increments of £100 , then from £500 to £64,000 with the pound value doubling for each new question , and finally from £125,000 to £1,000,000 with the pound value doubling for each new question .   After viewing a question , the contestant can leave the game with the money already won rather than attempting an answer ."]], [[61, "'how many films were made by director sir peter jackson from tolkien's short book, ''the hobbit''?'", "The Hobbit , or There and Back Again is a children 's fantasy novel by English author J. Tolkien . It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim , being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction . The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children 's literature .   Set in a time `` Between the Dawn of Færie and the Dominion of Men '' , The Hobbit follows the quest of home-loving hobbit Bilbo Baggins to win a share of the treasure guarded by the dragon , Smaug . The story is told in the form of an episodic quest , and most chapters introduce a specific creature , or type of creature , of Tolkien 's geography . The story reaches its climax in the Battle of the Five Armies , where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict .   Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story . Along with motifs of warfare , these themes have led critics to view Tolkien 's own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story . The author 's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences .   Encouraged by the book 's critical and financial success , the publisher requested a sequel . As Tolkien 's work on the successor The Lord of the Rings progressed , he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit . These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition . Further editions followed with minor emendations , including those reflecting Tolkien 's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled . Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage , screen , radio , board games and video games . Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits .   Characters   Bilbo Baggins , the titular protagonist , is a respectable , reserved hobbit . Gandalf , an itinerant wizard , introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves . During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at , only to appear again at key moments in the story . Thorin Oakenshield , the proud , pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain , makes many mistakes in his leadership , relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to get him out of trouble , but he proves himself a mighty warrior .   The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance , such as the twelve other dwarves of the company ; two types of elves : both puckish and more serious warrior types ; Men ; man-eating trolls ; boulder-throwing giants ; evil cave-dwelling goblins ; forest-dwelling giant spiders who can speak ; immense and heroic eagles who also speak ; evil wolves , or wargs , who are allied with the goblins ; Elrond the sage ; Gollum , a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake ; Beorn , a man who can assume bear form ; and Bard the Bowman , a grim but honourable archer of Lake-town .   Plot   Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of dwarves , who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the dragon Smaug . When the music ends , Gandalf unveils a map showing a secret door into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition 's `` burglar '' . The dwarves ridicule the idea , but Bilbo , indignant , joins despite himself .   The group travels into the wild , where Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to Rivendell , where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map ."]], [[62, 'the 1997 transfer of hong kong from great britain to china is well-known. but in 1999, which country similarly relinquished its claim on macau also handing it over to china?', "Macau ( ; ) , also spelled Macao , officially the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People 's Republic of China , is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta , China .

It involved every European great power of the time except the Ottoman Empire , spanning five continents , and affected Europe , the Americas , West Africa , India , and the Philippines . The conflict split Europe into two coalitions , led by Great Britain on one side and France on the other . For the first time , aiming to curtail Britain and Prussia 's ever-growing might , France formed a grand coalition of its own , which ended with failure as Britain rose as the world 's predominant power , altering the European balance of power .   In the historiography of some countries , the war is named after combatants in its respective theatres , e. the French and Indian War in the United States . In French-speaking Canada , it is known as the War of the Conquest , while it is called the Seven Years ' War in English-speaking Canada ( North America , 1754–1763 ) , Pomeranian War ( with Sweden and Prussia , 1757–1762 ) , Third Carnatic War ( on the Indian subcontinent , 1757–1763 ) , and Third Silesian War ( with Prussia and Austria , 1756–1763 ) .   Conflict between Great Britain and France broke out in 1754–1756 when the British attacked disputed French positions in North America and seized hundreds of French merchant ships . Meanwhile , rising power Prussia was struggling with Austria for dominance within and outside the Holy Roman Empire in central Europe .   Realizing that war was imminent , Prussia preemptively struck Saxony and quickly overran it . The result caused uproar across Europe . Because of Prussia 's alliance with Britain , Austria formed an alliance with France , seeing an opportunity to recapture Silesia , which had been lost in a previous war . The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by smaller German states ( especially Hanover ) . Sweden , fearing Prussia 's expansionist tendencies , went to war in 1757 to protect its Baltic dominions , seeing its chance when virtually all of Europe opposed Prussia . Spain , bound by the Pacte de Famille , intervened on behalf of France and together they launched an utterly unsuccessful invasion of Portugal in 1762 . The Russian Empire was originally aligned with Austria , fearing Prussia 's ambition on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , but switched sides upon the succession of Tsar Peter III in 1762 .   Many middle and small powers in Europe , unlike in the previous wars , tried to steer clear away from the escalating conflict , even though they had interests in the conflict or with the belligerents , like Denmark-Norway . The Dutch Republic , a long-time British ally , kept its neutrality intact , fearing the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe , and even tried to prevent Britain 's domination in India .   The war ended with the Treaty of Paris between France , Spain and Great Britain and the Treaty of Hubertusburg between Saxony , Austria and Prussia , in 1763 .   The war was successful for Great Britain , which gained the bulk of New France in North America , Spanish Florida , some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies , the colony of Senegal on the West African coast , and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent . The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement ; a subsequent conflict , known as Pontiac 's War , was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status . Prussia emerged as a new European great power ."]], [[65, "'which veteran rock singer released the album ''the healing game'' in 1997?'", "Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as `` rock and roll '' in the United States in the 1950s , and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later , particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Lonergan , The Classic Rock and Roll Reader : Rock Music from its Beginnings to the mid-1970s ( Abingdon : Routledge , 1999 ) , ISBN 0-7890-0151-9 It has its roots in 1940s ' and 1950s ' rock and roll , itself heavily influenced by blues , rhythm and blues and country music . Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk , and incorporated influences from jazz , classical and other musical sources .   Musically , rock has centered on the electric guitar , usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums . Typically , rock is song-based music usually with a 4/4 time signature using a verse-chorus form , but the genre has become extremely diverse . Like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political in emphasis . The dominance of rock by white , male musicians has been seen as one of the key factors shaping the themes explored in rock music . Rock places a higher degree of emphasis on musicianship , live performance , and an ideology of authenticity than pop music .   By the late 1960s , referred to as the `` golden age '' or `` classic rock '' period , a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , raga rock , and jazz-rock , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock , which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic scene . New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock , which extended the artistic elements ; glam rock , which highlighted showmanship and visual style ; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal , which emphasized volume , power , and speed . In the second half of the 1970s , punk rock reacted against the perceived overblown , inauthentic and overly mainstream aspects of these genres to produce a stripped-down , energetic form of music valuing raw expression and often lyrically characterised by social and political critiques . Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres , including new wave , post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement . From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge , Britpop , and indie rock .   Rock music has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements , leading to major sub-cultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the hippie counterculture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s . Similarly , 1970s punk culture spawned the visually distinctive goth and emo subcultures . Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song , rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race , sex and drug use , and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity .google.co.uk/books ? id  RK-JmVbv4OIC & pgPA80 Rock and Roll : An Introduction ] , pages 80-81 The sound of an electric guitar in rock music is typically supported by an electric bass guitar , which pioneered in jazz music in the same era , and percussion produced from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals .

Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers ; while most set a threshold of three murders , others extend it to four or lessen it to two . The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , for example , defines serial killing as `` a series of two or more murders , committed as separate events , usually , but not always , by one offender acting alone '' .   Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrillseeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion , and the victims may have something in common : age group , appearance , gender , or race , for example .   Serial killing is not the same as mass murdering ( killing numerous people in a given incident ) ; nor is it spree killing ( in which murders are committed in two or more locations , in a short time ) . However , cases of extended bouts of sequential killings over periods of weeks or months with no apparent `` cooling off period '' or `` return to normalcy '' have caused some experts to suggest a hybrid category of `` spree-serial killer '' .   Etymology   The English term and concept of `` serial killer '' are commonly attributed to former FBI Special agent Robert Ressler in 1974 . Author Ann Rule postulates in her book Kiss Me , Kill Me ( 2004 ) that the English-language credit for coining the term serial killer goes to LAPD detective Pierce Brooks , who created the ViCAP system in 1985 . Subsequently , throughout the 1980s , the term was used in the pages of the New York Times on 233 occasions , but by the end of the 1990s , in the publication 's second decade , the use of the term escalated to 2,514 times in the nation 's `` newspaper of record '' . The German term and concept were coined by the influential Ernst Gennat , who described Peter Kürten as a Serienmörder ( literally `` serial murderer '' ) in his article `` Die Düsseldorfer Sexualverbrechen '' ( 1930 ) . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the specific term `` serial killer '' first arose abroad in a 1960s German film article written by Siegfried Kracauer about the film M ( 1931 ) , a German expressionist film about a pedophilic Serienmörder .   Characteristics   General   Some commonly found characteristics of serial killers include the following :  * They may exhibit varying degrees of mental illness and/or psychopathy , which may contribute to their homicidal behavior . Unlike people with major mental disorders such as schizophrenia , psychopaths can seem normal and often quite charming , a state of adaptation that psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley called the `` mask of sanity '' .  * They were often abused—emotionally , physically and/or sexually—by a family member ."]], [[68, "in the bible who was david's father?", "David ( ; ISO 259-3 Dawid ; ; ) was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah , reigning c.1010-970 BCE .

War comes between Israel and the Philistines , and the giant Goliath challenges the Israelites to send out a champion to face him in single combat . David , sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers serving in Saul 's army , declares that he can defeat Goliath . Refusing the king 's offer of the royal armour , he kills Goliath with his sling . Saul inquires the name of the young hero .   Saul sets David over his army .

Generally , a film director controls a film 's artistic and dramatic aspects , and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision . The director has a key role in choosing the cast members , production design , and the creative aspects of filmmaking . Under European Union law , the director is viewed as the author of the film .   The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized , or noticed . Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay in the boundaries of the film 's budget . There are many pathways to becoming a film director . Some film directors started as screenwriters , cinematographers , film editors or actors . Other film directors have attended a film school . Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue , while others control every aspect , and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely . Some directors edit or appear in their films , or compose the music score for their films .   Responsibility   Film directors create an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized/noticed . Realizing this vision includes overseeing the artistic and technical elements of film production , as well as directing the shooting timetable and meeting deadlines . This entails organizing the film crew in such a way as to achieve their vision of the film . This requires skills of group leadership , as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful , fast-paced environment of a film set .   Since the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions , he or she or it or they also needs/need to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary . Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film . It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again . Omnipresent are the boundaries of the films budget . Theoretically the sole superior of a director is the studio that is financing the film , however a poor working relationship between a film director and an actor could possibly result in the director being replaced if the actor is a major film star . Even so , it is arguable that the director spends more time on a project than anyone else , considering that the director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production . Thus , the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one .   Under European Union law , the film director is considered the `` author '' or one of the authors of a film , largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory .   Career pathways   Some film directors started as screenwriters , film editors or actors . Several American cinematographers have become directors , including Barry Sonnenfeld , originally the Coen brothers ' DP ; Jan de Bont , cinematographer on films as Die Hard and Basic Instinct , directed Speed and Twister ."]], [[70, 'what building in pall mall, commissioned by henry viii around 1532, is the administrative centre of the british monarchy?', "Pall Mall is a street in the St James 's area of the City of Westminster , Central London . It connects St James 's Street to Trafalgar Square and is a section of the regional A4 road . The street 's name is derived from `` pall-mall '' , a ball game played there during the 17th century .   The area was built up during the reign of Charles II with fashionable London residences . The War Office was based on Pall Mall during the second half of the 19th century , and the Royal Automobile Club 's headquarters have been on the street since 1908 .   Geography   The street is around long and runs east in the St James 's area , from St James 's Street across Waterloo Place , to the Haymarket and continues as Pall Mall East towards Trafalgar Square .

History and topography   Early history and pall-mall field   Pall Mall was constructed in 1661 , replacing an earlier highway slightly to the south that ran from the Haymarket ( approximately where Warwick House Street is now ) to the royal residence , St James 's Palace . Historical research suggests a road had been in this location since Saxon times , although the earliest documentary references are from the 12th century in connection with a leper colony at St James 's Hospital . James 's Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century , the park 's boundary wall was built along the south side of the road . In 1620 , the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality .   Pall-mall , a ball game similar to croquet , was introduced to England in the early-17th century by James I . The game , already popular in France and Scotland , was enjoyed by James ' sons Henry and Charles . In 1630 , St James 's Field , London 's first pall-mall court , was laid out to the north of the Haymarket – St James road .   After the Restoration and King Charles II 's return to London on 29 May 1660 , a pall-mall court was constructed in St James 's Park just south of the wall , on the site of The Mall . Samuel Pepys 's diary entry for 2 April 1661 records that he `` . James 's Park , where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele , the first time that I ever saw the sport . In July 1661 posts and rails were erected , stopping up the old road .

The grant was endorsed `` Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James 's . ''   A new road was built on the site of the old pall-mall court , and opened in September 1661 . It was named Catherine Street , after Catherine of Braganza , wife of Charles II , but was better known as Pall Mall Street or the Old Pall Mall .

The KFA joined the AFC ( Asian Football Confederation ) in 1954 .   1954–1989   South Korea first entered the World Cup in 1954 as the second Asian team ever to compete in the World Cup after the Dutch East Indies . South Korea played games against Hungary and Turkey , losing 9–0 and 7–0 respectively ( the game scheduled against West Germany was never played because neither were seeded in their group , as per that tournament 's rules ) . It would take thirty-two years before South Korea was able to participate in the World Cup finals again .   South Korea would later participate in the first Asian Cup in 1956 .

The G20 heads of government or heads of state have periodically conferred at summits since their initial meeting in 2008 , and the group also hosts separate meetings of finance ministers and central bank governors .   The members include 19 individual countries—Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , South Korea , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , Turkey , the United Kingdom and the United States—along with the European Union ( EU ) . Collectively , the G20 economies account for around 85 % of the gross world product ( GWP ) , 80 % of world trade ( or , if excluding EU intra-trade , 75 % ) , and two-thirds of the world population .   With the G20 growing in stature after its inaugural leaders ' summit in 2008 , its leaders announced on 25 September 2009 that the group would replace the G8 as the main economic council of wealthy nations . Since its inception , the G20 's membership policies have been criticized by numerous intellectuals , and its summits have been a focus for major protests by anti-globalists , nationalists and others .   The heads of the G20 nations met semi-annually at G20 summits between 2009 and 2010 . Since the November 2011 Cannes summit , all G20 summits have been held annually .   History   The G20 is the latest in a series of post-World War II initiatives aimed at international coordination of economic policy , which include institutions such as the `` Bretton Woods twins '' , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , and what is now the World Trade Organization . The G20 superseded the G33 ( which had itself superseded the G22 ) , and was foreshadowed at the Cologne Summit of the G7 in June 1999 , but was only formally established at the G7 Finance Ministers ' meeting on 26 September 1999 . The inaugural meeting took place on 15–16 December 1999 in Berlin .   According to researchers at the Brookings Institution , the group was founded primarily at the initiative of Eichel , who was also concurrently chair of the G7 . However , some sources identify the G20 as a joint creation of Germany and the United States . According to University of Toronto political science professor John Kirton , the membership of the G20 was decided by Eichel 's deputy Caio Koch-Weser and then US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers ' deputy Timothy Geithner . In Kirton 's book G20 Governance for a Globalised World , he claims that :   Though the G20 's primary focus is global economic governance , the themes of its summits vary from year to year . For example , the theme of the 2006 G20 ministerial meeting was `` Building and Sustaining Prosperity '' . Manuel , the South African Minister of Finance , was the chairperson of the G20 when South Africa hosted the secretariat in 2007 . Guido Mantega , Brazil 's Minister of Finance , was the chairperson of the G20 in 2008 ; Brazil proposed dialogue on competition in financial markets , clean energy and economic development and fiscal elements of growth and development . In a statement following a meeting of G7 finance ministers on 11 October 2008 , US President George W. Bush stated that the next meeting of the G20 would be important in finding solutions to the burgeoning economic crisis of 2008 .

More than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history . Over 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians died as a result of the war ( including the victims of a number of genocides ) , a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents ' technological and industrial sophistication , and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare . It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history , and paved the way for major political changes , including revolutions in many of the nations involved .   The war drew in all the world 's economic great powers , assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the British Empire , France and the Russian Empire ) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary . These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , while the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers . Within weeks , the major powers were at war and the conflict soon spread around the world .   On 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia . As Russia mobilised in support of Serbia , Germany invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg before moving towards France , leading the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany . After the German march on Paris was halted , what became known as the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition , with a trench line that changed little until 1917 . On the Eastern Front , the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians , but the Germans stopped its invasion of East Prussia . In November 1914 , the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers , opening fronts in the Caucasus , Mesopotamia and the Sinai . In 1915 , Italy joined the Allies and Bulgaria joined the Central Power ; Romania joined the Allies in 1916 , as did the United States in 1917 .   The Russian government collapsed in March 1917 , and a revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers via the Treaty of Brest Litovsk , which was a massive German victory . After a stunning German offensive along the Western Front in the spring of 1918 , the Allies rallied and drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives . National borders were redrawn , with several independent nations restored or created , and Germany 's colonies were parceled out among the winners . During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 , the Big Four ( Britain , France , the United States and Italy ) imposed their terms in a series of treaties . This effort failed , and economic depression , renewed European nationalism , weakened member states , and the German feeling of humiliation contributed to the rise of Nazism . These conditions eventually contributed to World War II .

In principle , any object that produces sound can be a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument . The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture . Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment . Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications .   The date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed . The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument , a simple flute , dates back as far as 67,000 years . Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago . However , most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative instability of materials used to make them . Many early musical instruments were made from animal skins , bone , wood , and other non-durable materials .   Musical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world . By 1400 , musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the Occident .   Musical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right , and many systems of classification have been used over the years . Instruments can be classified by their effective range , their material composition , their size , etc . The academic study of musical instruments is called organology .   Definition and basic operation   A musical instrument makes sounds . Once humans moved from making sounds with their bodies—for example , by clapping—to using objects to create music from sounds , musical instruments were born . Primitive instruments were probably designed to emulate natural sounds , and their purpose was ritual rather than entertainment . The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were unknown to early players of musical instruments . A player sounding a flute to signal the start of a hunt does so without thought of the modern notion of `` making music '' .   Musical instruments are constructed in a broad array of styles and shapes , using many different materials . Early musical instruments were made from `` found objects '' such a shells and plant parts . As instruments evolved , so did the selection and quality of materials . Virtually every material in nature has been used by at least one culture to make musical instruments .   Archaeology   Researchers have discovered archaeological evidence of musical instruments in many parts of the world . Some finds are 67,000 years old , however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute . As such , the specimens found can not be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments . The carving , named the Divje Babe Flute , features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined could have been used to play four notes of a diatonic scale . Researchers estimate the flute 's age at between 43,400 and 67,000 years , making it the oldest known musical instrument and the only musical instrument associated with the Neanderthal culture . However , some archaeologists and ethnomusicologists dispute the flute 's status as a musical instrument . The flutes were made in the Upper Paleolithic age , and are more commonly accepted as being the oldest known musical instruments ."]], [[78, 'by what first name is the wife of tommy beresford known in the partners in crime stories by agatha christie, recently adapted by bbc tv?', "Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie , Lady Mallowan , DBE ( née Miller ; 15 September 1890 – 12 January 1976 ) was an English crime novelist , short story writer and playwright .

She was initially unsuccessful at getting her work published , but in 1920 The Bodley Head press published her novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles , featuring the character of Hercule Poirot . This launched her literary career .   The Guinness Book of World Records lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time . According to Index Translationum , she remains the most-translated individual author – having been translated into at least 103 languages .   Christie 's stage play The Mousetrap holds the record for the longest initial run : it opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25 November 1952 and is still running after more than 25,000 performances .

The group , who were in the forefront of the UK beat-group boom , were the first backing band to emerge as stars . As pioneers of the four-member instrumental format , the band consisted of lead guitar , rhythm guitar , bass guitar and drums . Their range covers pop , rock , surf rock and ballads with a jazz influence .   The core members are Hank Marvin , Bruce Welch and Brian Bennett . The Shadows , with Cliff Richard , dominated British popular music in the late 1950s and early 1960s in the years before the Beatles .

His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna , and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 , at age 49 , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive , which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , sexuality , and religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others .   Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613 . His early plays were primarily comedies and histories , and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres . He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608 , including Hamlet , Othello , King Lear , and Macbeth , considered some of the finest works in the English language . In his last phase , he wrote tragicomedies , also known as romances , and collaborated with other playwrights .   Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime . In 1623 , however , John Heminges and Henry Condell , two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare , published a more definitive text known as the First Folio , a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare 's . It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson , in which Shakespeare is hailed , presciently , as `` not of an age , but for all time '' .The Norton Anthology of English Literature : Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century , Volume B , 2012 , pg .   Life   Early life   William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare , an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield , and Mary Arden , the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer . He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564 . His actual date of birth remains unknown , but is traditionally observed on 23 April , Saint George 's Day . This date , which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar 's mistake , has proved appealing to biographers , because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 . He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son .   At the age of 18 , Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway . The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582 .

An antifreeze mixture is used to achieve freezing-point depression for cold environments and also achieves boiling-point elevation ( `` anti-boil '' ) to allow higher coolant temperature . Freezing and boiling points are colligative properties of a solution , which depend on the concentration of the dissolved substance .   Because water has good properties as a coolant , water plus antifreeze is used in internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications , such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters . The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes . Commercially , both the additive ( pure concentrate ) and the mixture ( diluted solution ) are called antifreeze , depending on the context . Careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a wide temperature range in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase , which is critical to efficient heat transfer and the proper functioning of heat exchangers .   Salts are frequently used for de-icing , but salt solutions are not used for cooling systems because they can cause severe corrosion to metals . Instead , non-corrosive antifreezes are commonly used for critical de-icing , such as for aircraft wings .   Automotive and internal combustion engine use   Most automotive engines are `` water '' -cooled to remove waste heat , although the `` water '' is actually antifreeze/water mixture and not plain water . The term engine coolant is widely used in the automotive industry , which covers its primary function of convective heat transfer for internal combustion engines . Water pump seal lubricant is also added .   Antifreeze was developed to overcome the shortcomings of water as a heat transfer fluid . If plain water were to be used as an engine coolant , it would promote galvanic corrosion . Proper engine coolant and a pressurized coolant system can help obviate the problems which make plain water incompatible with automotive engines . With proper antifreeze , a wide temperature range can be tolerated by the engine coolant , such as to for 50 % ( by volume ) propylene glycol diluted with water and a 15 psi pressurized coolant system .   Early engine coolant antifreeze was methanol ( methyl alcohol ) . Methanol was widely used in windshield fluids , however , in Europe , due to new REACH legislation , the use of methanol in windshield fluids is limited to 5 % and in the near future will be further reduced to 3 % . As radiator caps were vented , not sealed , the methanol was lost to evaporation , requiring frequent replenishment to avoid freezing of the coolant . Ethylene glycol was developed , and soon replaced methanol as an engine cooling system antifreeze . Before the 1950s , coolant systems were unpressurized and the engine was often cooler than modern automotive engines . By pressurizing the coolant system with a radiator cap , the boiling point of the fluid is increased , permitting higher engine temperatures and better fuel efficiency .   Other uses   The most common water-based antifreeze solutions used in electronics cooling are mixtures of water and either ethylene glycol ( EGW ) or propylene glycol ( PGW ) ."]], [[84, "from which film, for which chaplin film wrote the music, did petula clark have a number one with 'this is my song'?", "Sir Charles Spencer `` Charlie '' Chaplin , ( 16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977 ) was an English comic actor , filmmaker , and composer who rose to fame in the silent era . Chaplin became a worldwide icon through his screen persona `` the Tramp '' and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry .   Chaplin 's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship . Chaplin began performing at an early age , touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian . At 19 he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company , which took him to America . Chaplin was scouted for the film industry , and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios . He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base . Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage , and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay , Mutual , and First National corporations .   In 1919 , Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists , which gave him complete control over his films . He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s , instead producing City Lights ( 1931 ) and Modern Times ( 1936 ) without dialogue . Chaplin became increasingly political , and his next film , The Great Dictator ( 1940 ) , satirised Adolf Hitler . The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin , and his popularity declined rapidly . An FBI investigation was opened , and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland . He abandoned the Tramp in his later films , which include Monsieur Verdoux ( 1947 ) , Limelight ( 1952 ) , A King in New York ( 1957 ) , and A Countess from Hong Kong ( 1967 ) .   Chaplin wrote , directed , produced , edited , starred in , and composed the music for most of his films . He was a perfectionist , and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture . His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos , typified in the Tramp 's struggles against adversity . In 1972 , as part of a renewed appreciation for his work , Chaplin received an Honorary Academy Award for `` the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century '' .

It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece . Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization , and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself .   Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives , and implicitly in Greek representational arts , such as vase-paintings and votive gifts . Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world , and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods , goddesses , heroes , heroines and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature .  The oldest known Greek literary sources , Homer 's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes . 900–800 BC onward . In fact , literary and archaeological sources integrate , sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict ; however , in many cases , the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots .   Literary sources   Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature . Nevertheless , the only general mythographical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity was the Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus . 180–125 BC and wrote on many of these topics . Other poets completed the `` epic cycle '' , but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely . Despite their traditional name , the `` Homeric Hymns '' have no direct connection with Homer . They are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so-called Lyric age . Hesiod , a possible contemporary with Homer , offers in his Theogony ( Origin of the Gods ) the fullest account of the earliest Greek myths , dealing with the creation of the world ; the origin of the gods , Titans , and Giants ; as well as elaborate genealogies , folktales , and etiological myths . Hesiod 's Works and Days , a didactic poem about farming life , also includes the myths of Prometheus , Pandora , and the Five Ages ."]], [[86, 'what is the name of 11 roman emperors, the first of which transferred the capital to byzantium in 330 ad, and the last of which died when it was captured by the turks in 1453?', "Byzantium ( ; Byzántion ) was an ancient Greek colony on the site that later became Constantinople , and later still Istanbul . 657 BC .   Name   The etymology of Byzantion is unknown . It has been suggested that the name is of Thraco-Illyrian origin , It may be derived from a Thracian or Illyrian personal name , Byzas . Ancient Greek legend refers to a legendary king Byzas , the leader of the Megarean colonists and founder of the city .  The form Byzantium is a Latinization of the original name . Much later , the name Byzantium became common in the West to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire , the `` Byzantine '' Empire , whose capital Constantinople stood on the site of ancient Byzantium . This usage was introduced only in 1555 by the German historian Hieronymus Wolf , a century after the empire had ceased to exist .   History   The European side ( at Seraglio Point ) featured only two fishing settlements : Lygos and Semistra . The origins of Byzantium are shrouded in legend . The traditional legend has it that Byzas from Megara ( a city-state near Athens ) founded Byzantium in 667 BC when he sailed northeast across the Aegean Sea . He adjudged the Chalcedonians blind not to have recognized the advantages the land on the European side of the Bosphorus had over the Asiatic side . In 667 BC he founded Byzantium at their location , thus fulfilling the oracle 's requirement .   It was mainly a trading city due to its location at the Black Sea 's only entrance . Byzantium later conquered Chalcedon , across the Bosporus on the Asiatic side .   Byzantium was besieged by Greek forces during the Peloponnesian war . As part of Sparta 's strategy for cutting off grain supplies to Athens , Sparta took the city in 411 BC . The Athenian military later took the city in 408 BC .   After siding with Pescennius Niger against the victorious Septimius Severus , the city was besieged by Roman forces and suffered extensive damage in 196 AD . It was bound to Perinthos during the period of Septimius Severus . ( See Nova Roma . ) After his death the city was called Constantinople ( Greek Κωνσταντινούπολις or Konstantinoupolis ) ( `` city of Constantine '' ) . It was a commercial , cultural , and diplomatic centre . With its strategic position , Constantinople controlled the major trade routes between Asia and Europe , as well as the passage from the Mediterranean Sea to the Black Sea . On May 29 , 1453 , the city fell to the Ottoman Turks , and again became the capital of a powerful state , the Ottoman Empire . The Turks called the city `` Istanbul '' ( although it was not officially renamed until 1930 ) ; the name derives from `` eis-tin-polin '' ( Greek : `` to-the-city '' ) . To this day it remains the largest and most populous city in Turkey , although Ankara is now the national capital ."]], [[87, 'how many military conflicts have been generally given the name of world war?', "The military , also called the armed forces , are forces authorized to use deadly force , and weapons , to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens . The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens , and the prosecution of war against another state . The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society , including , the promotion of a political agenda , protecting corporate economic interests , internal population control , construction , emergency services , social ceremonies , and guarding important areas .   The profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself . Some of the most enduring images of the classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders . Latin and Romance language root word `` mil- '' )  The first recorded use of the word military in English , spelled militarie , was in 1585 . It comes from the Latin militaris ( from Latin miles meaning `` soldier '' ) but is of uncertain etymology , one suggestion being derived from * mil-it- – going in a body or mass . The word is now identified as denoting someone that is skilled in use of weapons , or engaged in military service or in warfare .   As a noun the military usually refers generally to a country 's armed forces or sometimes , more specifically , to the senior officers who command them .   As an adjective military originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering , but it soon broadened to apply to land forces in general and anything to do with their profession . The names of both the Royal Military Academy ( 1741 ) and United States Military Academy ( 1802 ) reflect this . However , at about the time of the Napoleonic Wars , `` military '' began to be used in reference to armed forces as a whole and in the 21st century expressions like `` military service '' , `` military intelligence '' and `` military history '' encompass naval , marine and air force aspects . As such , it now connotes any activity performed by armed force personnel .   History   Military history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts , not just the history of the state militaries . It differs somewhat from the history of war with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology , governments , and geography .   Military history has a number of purposes . One main purpose is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes so as to more effectively wage war in the future . Another is to create a sense of military tradition which is used to create cohesive military forces . Still another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively . Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and oral history of military conflicts ( war ) , their participating armies and navies and , more recently , air forces .   There are two types of military history , although almost all texts have elements of both : descriptive history that serves to chronicle conflicts without offering any statements about the causes , nature of conduct , the ending and effects of a conflict ;"]], [[88, 'which english king stole the stone of scone from scone palace?', "The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th century—when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms—until 1707 , when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain .

Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066–1154 , Plantagenet 1154–1485 , Tudor 1485–1603 and Stuart 1603–1714 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649–1660 ) .

The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327–1377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais .

A hallmark of the series shows Briggs or Phelps receiving his instructions on a recording that then self-destructs , followed by the theme music composed by Lalo Schifrin .   The series was filmed and financed by Desilu Productions , and aired on the CBS network from September 1966 to March 1973 . The series was reprised in 1988 for two seasons on ABC , retaining only Graves in the cast .   Series overview   The series follows the exploits of the Impossible Missions Force ( IMF ) , a small team of secret agents used for covert missions against dictators , evil organizations and ( primarily in later episodes ) crime lords .   The identities of the higher echelons of the organization that oversees the IMF are never revealed . In the 1980s revival , it is suggested the IMF is an independent agency of the United States government .   IMF agents   The leader of the IMF is initially Dan Briggs , played by Steven Hill . As an Orthodox Jew , Hill had to leave on Fridays at 4 p.m. to be home before sundown and was not available until after dark the next day .

In practice , however ( especially after the first season ) , Briggs and especially Phelps would choose the same core group of three or four agents for every single mission , leading these regulars to be considered de facto full-time IMF agents .

Margaret spent much of her childhood years in the company of her older sister and parents . Her life changed dramatically in 1936 , when her paternal uncle , King Edward VIII , abdicated to marry the twice divorced American Wallis Simpson . Margaret 's father became King , and her older sister became heir presumptive , with Margaret second in line to the throne . During World War II , the two sisters stayed at Windsor Castle , despite suggestions to evacuate them to Canada . During the war years , Margaret was considered too young to perform any official duties , and instead continued her education .   After the war , Margaret fell in love with Group Captain Peter Townsend . In 1952 , Margaret 's father died , her sister became sovereign , and Townsend divorced his first wife . Early the following year , he proposed to Margaret . Many in the government felt that he would be an unsuitable husband for the Queen 's 22-year-old sister , and the Church of England refused to countenance a marriage to a divorced man . Margaret eventually abandoned her plans with him . The couple had two children ; they later divorced in 1978 .

The objective is to score points by knocking down as many pins as possible . Three finger holes are drilled into a traditional bowling ball , and weights vary considerably to make the sport playable for all ages . While professional ten-pin bowling tournaments are held in numerous countries , the sport is commonly played as a hobby by millions of people around the world .   In Canada , the United States , United Kingdom and Australia , the game is commonly referred to as just `` Bowling '' . In New England , `` bowling '' is usually referred to as `` ten-pin bowling '' or `` big-ball bowling '' , because of the smaller diameter , lighter weight ball used in the Worcester , Massachusetts-conceived sport of candlepin bowling from 1880 , and the similarly `` small-ball '' sport of duckpin bowling ( conceived in 1895 ) , popular in the Northeast United States , as well as Canada 's own sport of five-pin bowling , all three of which use smaller diameter , lighter weight bowling balls when compared to tenpin bowling , without the necessity for finger holes in them . The narrow lane prevents bowling a straight line at the angle required to consistently carry ( knock down ) all ten pins for a strike . Most skillful bowlers will roll a side spinning ( hook shape reaction ) ball to overcome this . A foul line is marked at the end of the lane nearest to the bowler : if any part of a bowler 's body touches the line itself or beyond ( anywhere on the actual lane surface or any adjoining areas including walls and other lanes ) after the ball is delivered , the bowl is a foul and any pins knocked over by that delivery are scored as zero ( 0 ) . The bowler is allowed one shot at a new rack of ten pins if s/he fouled on the first roll of a frame , and if all ten pins are knocked down on this shot , it is scored as a spare . 60 ft from the foul line , where the lane terminates , it is joined to a roughly 36 in deep by wide surface of durable and impact-resistant material called the `` pin deck '' , upon which each rack of pins is set .   Play   The bowler is allowed 10 frames in which to knock down pins , with frames one ( 1 ) through nine ( 9 ) being composed of up to two rolls . The tenth frame is composed of up to three rolls : the bonus roll ( s ) following a strike or spare in the tenth ( sometimes referred to as the eleventh and twelfth frames ) are fill ball ( s ) used only to calculate the score of the mark rolled in the tenth . If neither a strike or a spare is achieved in the tenth frame , no bonus roll is awarded .   Bowling has a unique scoring system which keeps track not only of the current pinfall in a frame , but also strikes and spares which allow for the value of subsequent pinfall . Effectively , there are three kinds of marks given in a score ; a strike ( all ten down in the first ball ) , a spare ( all ten down by the second ball ) , and an open ( one or more missed pins still standing after the second ball ) . ( For example , if a player got a strike then followed with a 7 then 2 , their value for the strike frame would be 10+7+2 , or 19 . ) A spare earns ten points plus the points for the next ball thrown ."]]]
