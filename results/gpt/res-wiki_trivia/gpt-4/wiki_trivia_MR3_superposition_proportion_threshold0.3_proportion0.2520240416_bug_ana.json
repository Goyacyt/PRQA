An incoming light to the human eye that stimulates all its three types of color sensitive cone cells in nearly equal amounts results in white . White is one of the most common colors in nature , the color of sunlight , snow , milk , chalk , limestone and other common minerals . In many cultures white represents or signifies purity , innocence , and light , and is the symbolic opposite of black , or darkness . According to surveys in Europe and the United States , white is the color most often associated with perfection , the good , honesty , cleanliness , the beginning , the new , neutrality , and exactitude .   In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome , priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity , and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity , and a white lamb sacrifice and purity ; the widows of kings dressed in white rather than black as the color of mourning . It sometimes symbolizes royalty ; it was the color of the French kings ( black being the color of the queens ) and of the monarchist movement after the French Revolution as well as of the movement called the White Russians ( not to be confounded with Belarus , literally `` White Russia '' ) who fought the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War ( 1917–1922 ) . Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble , and beginning in the 18th century , with the advent of neoclassical architecture , white became the most common color of new churches , capitols and other government buildings , especially in the United States . It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity , simplicity and strength .   White is an important color for almost all world religions . The Pope , the head of the Roman Catholic Church , has worn white since 1566 , as a symbol of purity and sacrifice . In Islam , and in the Shinto religion of Japan , it is worn by pilgrims ; and by the Brahmins in India . In Western cultures and in Japan , white is the most common color for wedding dresses , symbolizing purity and virginity . In many Asian cultures , white is also the color of mourning .   The white color on television screens and computer monitors is created with the RGB color model by mixing red , green and blue light at equal intensities .

In nature , snow and clouds appear white because they are composed of water droplets or ice crystals mixed with air ; when white sunlight enters snow , very little of the spectrum is absorbed ; almost all of the light is reflected or scattered by the air and water molecules , so the snow appears to be the color of sunlight , white . Beaches with sand containing high amounts of quartz or eroded limestone also appear white , since quartz and limestone reflect or scatter sunlight , rather than absorbing it . Tropical white sand beaches may also have a high quantity of white calcium carbonate from tiny bits of seashells ground to fine sand by the action of the waves .

The Tempest   Prospero is the rightful Duke of Milan , whose usurping brother , Antonio , had put him ( with his then three-year old daughter , Miranda ) to sea on `` a rotten carcass of a butt [ boat ] '' to die , 12 years before the play begins . Prospero and Miranda survived and found exile on a small island . He has learned sorcery from books , and uses it while on the island to protect Miranda and control the other characters . Before the play has begun , Prospero frees Ariel from entrapment within `` a cloven pine '' , about which Prospero states :   Prospero 's sorcery is sufficiently powerful to control Ariel and other spirits , as well as to alter weather and even raise the dead : `` Graves at my command have waked their sleepers , oped , and let 'em forth , by my so potent Art . `` - Act V , scene 1 .   On the island , Prospero becomes master of the monster Caliban ( the son of Sycorax , a malevolent witch ) and forces Caliban into submission by punishing him with magic if he does not obey . Ariel is beholden to Prospero after he is freed from his imprisonment inside the pine tree .   At the end of the play , Prospero intends to drown his book and renounce magic . In the view of the audience , this may have been required to make the ending unambiguously happy , as magic was associated with diabolical works ; he will drown his books for the same reason that Doctor Faust , in an earlier play by Christopher Marlowe , promised in vain to burn his books .   Prospero 's speech   The final soliloquy and epilogue in The Tempest is considered to be one of the most memorable speeches in Shakespearean literature .   Now my charms are all o'erthrown ,  And what strength I have 's mine own ,  Which is most faint : now , 't is true ,  I must be here confined by you ,  Or sent to Naples . Let me not ,  Since I have my dukedom got  And pardon 'd the deceiver , dwell  In this bare island by your spell ;  But release me from my bands  With the help of your good hands :  Gentle breath of yours my sails  Must fill , or else my project fails ,  Which was to please . Now I want  Spirits to enforce , art to enchant ,  And my ending is despair ,  Unless I be relieved by prayer ,  Which pierces so that it assaults  Mercy itself and frees all faults .  As you from crimes would pardon 'd be ,  Let your indulgence set me free .   In it , Prospero states his loss ( magic ) and his continuing imprisonment if the audience is not pleased . Many feel that since The Tempest was the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone , Prospero 's feelings echo Shakespeare 's own , or perhaps may even have been his `` retirement speech '' .

Simultaneous censuses were taken in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man , with the returns being archived with those of England . In addition to providing detailed information about national demographics , the results of the census play an important part in the calculation of resource allocation to regional and local service providers by the governments of both the UK and the European Union . The most recent UK census took place in 2011 .   History   Tax assessments ( known in the later Empire as the indiction ) were made in Britain in Roman times , but detailed records have not survived . In the 7th century AD , Dál Riata ( parts of what is now Scotland and Northern Ireland ) conducted a census , called the `` Tradition of the Men of Alba '' ( Senchus fer n-Alban ) . England conducted its first formal census when the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086 under William I for tax purposes .   Distinct from earlier , less inclusive censuses ( e.g . for religious purposes ) , national decennial censuses of the general population started in 1801 , championed by the statistician John Rickman . The censuses were initially conducted partly to ascertain the number of men able to fight in the Napoleonic Wars , and partly over population concerns stemming from the 1798 work An Essay on the Principle of Population by Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus . Rickman 's twelve reasons – set out in 1798 and repeated in Parliamentary debates – for conducting a census of Great Britain included the following justifications :  * `` the intimate knowledge of any country must form the rational basis of legislation and diplomacy ''  * `` an industrious population is the basic power and resource of any nation , and therefore its size needs to be known ''  * `` the number of men who were required for conscription to the militia in different areas should reflect the area 's population ''  * `` there were defence reasons for wanting to know the number of seamen ''  * `` the need to plan the production of corn and thus to know the number of people who had to be fed ''  * `` a census would indicate the Government 's intention to promote the public good '' , and  * `` the life insurance industry would be stimulated by the results '' .   Regular national censuses have taken place nearly every ten years since 1801 , most recently in 2011 ; other partial censuses have been made on some of the intervening fifth anniversaries . The first four censuses ( 1801–1831 ) were mainly statistical : that is , mainly headcounts , with virtually no personal information . A small number of older records exist in local record offices as by-products of the notes made by enumerators in the production of those earlier censuses ; these might list all persons or just the heads of households . The 1841 Census was the first to intentionally record names of all individuals in a household or institution .   The Census Act of 1920 provides the legal framework for conducting all censuses in Great Britain ( Scotland , England , and Wales ) . The primary legislation for Northern Ireland was introduced in 1969 . Before this legislation , it was necessary to have a separate act of parliament for each census . Britain was also responsible for initiating and co-ordinating censuses in many of its overseas colonies .   Because of the disruption caused by the Second World War , there was no census in 1941 . However , following the passage into law on 5 September 1939 of the National Registration Act 1939 , a population count was carried out on 29 September 1939 . The resulting National Register was later used to develop the NHS Central Register . Censuses were taken on 26 April 1931 in Great Britain , but the returns for England and Wales were destroyed in an accidental fire during the Second World War .   On 24 April 1966 , the UK trialled an alternative method of enumeration – long form/short form . Every household was given a short form to complete , while a sample of the population was given a long form to collect more detailed information . The short form was used for the population count and to"], [3, "Dada or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century . Dada in Zürich , Switzerland , began in 1916 at Cabaret Voltaire , spreading to Berlin shortly thereafter , but the height of New York Dada was the year before , in 1915 . The term anti-art , a precursor to Dada , was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 when he created his first readymades . Dada , in addition to being anti-war , had political affinities with the radical left and was also anti-bourgeois .   At least two works qualified as pre-Dadaist , a posteriori , had already sensitized the public and artists alike : Ubu Roi ( 1896 ) by Alfred Jarry , and the ballet Parade ( 1916–17 ) by Erik Satie . The roots of Dada lay in pre-war avant-garde . Cubism and the development of collage , combined with Wassily Kandinsky 's theoretical writings and abstraction , detached the movement from the constraints of reality and convention . The influence of French poets and the writings of German Expressionists liberated Dada from the tight correlation between words and meaning . Avant-garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments . They had seen ( or participated in ) Cubist exhibitions held at Galería Dalmau , Barcelona ( 1912 ) , Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin ( 1912 ) , the Armory show in New York ( 1913 ) , SVU Mánes in Prague ( 1914 ) , several Jack of Diamonds exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring , Amsterdam ( between 1911 and 1915 ) . Futurism developed in response to the work of various artists . Dada subsequently combined these approaches .   Dada activities included public gatherings , demonstrations , and publication of art/literary journals ; passionate coverage of art , politics , and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media . Key figures in the movement included Hugo Ball , Emmy Hennings , Hans Arp , Raoul Hausmann , Hannah Höch , Johannes Baader , Tristan Tzara , Francis Picabia , Richard Huelsenbeck , George Grosz , John Heartfield , Marcel Duchamp , Beatrice Wood , Kurt Schwitters , Hans Richter , and Max Ernst , among others . The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements , and groups including surrealism , Nouveau Réalisme , pop art and Fluxus .   Overview   Dada was an informal international movement , with participants in Europe and North America . The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I . For many participants , the movement was a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests , which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war , and against the cultural and intellectual conformity—in art and more broadly in society—that corresponded to the war .   Many Dadaists believed that the 'reason ' and 'logic ' of bourgeois capitalist society had led people into war . They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace chaos and irrationality . For example , George Grosz later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest `` against this world of mutual destruction . ''   According to Hans Richter Dada was not art : it was `` anti-art . '' Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for . Where art was concerned with traditional aesthetics , Dada ignored aesthetics . If art was to appeal to sensibilities , Dada was intended to offend .   As Hugo Ball expressed it , `` For us , art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in . ''   A reviewer from the American Art News stated at the time that `` Dada philosophy is the sickest , most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man . '' Art historians have described Dada as being , in large part , a `` reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide . ''   Years later , Dada artists described the movement as `` a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis , a savior , a monster , which would lay waste to everything in its path ... [ It was ] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization ... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege .

He co-founded Apple Computer ( now Apple Inc. ) with Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs , providing administrative oversight for the new venture . He soon , however , sold his share of the new company for $ 800 US dollars , and later accepted $ 1,500 to forfeit any claims against Apple ( in total , ) .   Early life   Wayne was born in Cleveland , Ohio , United States on May 17 , 1934 . He trained as a technical draftsman at the School of Industrial Arts in New York . In 1956 he moved to California . Wayne 's first business venture was a company selling slot machines . The company failed , with Wayne reflecting in 2014 that , `` I discovered very quickly that I had no business being in business . I was far better working in engineering . ''   Career   Apple   Wayne worked with Steve Jobs at Atari before he , Jobs , and Wozniak founded Apple Computer on April 1 , 1976 . Serving as the venture 's `` adult supervision '' , Wayne drew the first Apple logo , wrote the three men 's original partnership agreement , and wrote the Apple I manual .   Wayne received a 10 % stake in Apple but relinquished his equity for US $ 800 less than two weeks later , on April 12 , 1976 . Legally , all members of a partnership are personally responsible for any debts incurred by any partner ; unlike Jobs and Wozniak , then 21 and 25 , Wayne had personal assets that potential creditors could seize . The failure of a slot machine company that he had started five years earlier also contributed to his decision to exit the partnership .   Later that year , venture capitalist Arthur Rock and Mike Markkula helped develop a business plan and converted the partnership to a corporation . A year after leaving Apple , Wayne received $ 1,500 for his agreement to forfeit any claims against the new company . In its first year of operations ( 1976 ) , Apple 's sales reached US $ 174,000 . In 1977 sales rose to US $ 2.7 million , in 1978 to US $ 7.8 million , and in 1980 to US $ 117 million . By 1982 Apple had a billion dollars in annual sales . In February 2015 , Apple 's value exceeded $ 700 billion , making it the most valuable U.S. company by far . Had Wayne kept his 10 % stock until then , it would have been worth billions .   Wayne has stated that he does not regret selling his share of the company as he made the `` best decision with the information available to me at the time '' . Wayne also stated that he felt the Apple enterprise `` would be successful , but at the same time there would be significant bumps along the way and I could n't risk it . I had already had a rather unfortunate business experience before . I was getting too old and those two were whirlwinds . It was like having a tiger by the tail and I could n't keep up with these guys . ''   Post-Apple   After leaving Apple , Wayne resisted Jobs ' attempts to get him to return , remaining at Atari until 1978 , when he joined Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and later an electronics company in Salinas , California .   Wayne retired to a Pahrump , Nevada mobile home park selling stamps and rare coins in Pahrump . Wayne never owned an Apple product until 2011 , when he was given an iPad 2 by Aral Balkan at the Update Conference in Brighton , England .   Wayne also ran a stamp shop in Milpitas , California for a short time in the late 1970s , Wayne 's Philatelics . After a number of break-ins , he moved his stamp operations to Nevada . The logo for the business was a wood-cut style design , with a man sitting under an apple tree , with the `` Wayne 's Philatelics '' name written in a flowing ribbon curved around the tree . This was the original logo he designed for Apple Computer .   In the early 1990s Wayne sold the original Apple company agreement , signed in 1976 by Jobs , Wozniak and himself , for $ 500 . In 2011 the contract was sold at auction for $ 1.6 million . Wayne has stated"], [5, "Romanesque architecture is an architectural style of medieval Europe characterized by semi-circular arches . There is no consensus for the beginning date of the Romanesque style , with proposals ranging from the 6th to the late 10th century , this later date being the most commonly held . It developed in the 12th century into the Gothic style , marked by pointed arches . Examples of Romanesque architecture can be found across the continent , making it the first pan-European architectural style since Imperial Roman Architecture . The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as Norman architecture .   Combining features of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings and other local traditions , Romanesque architecture is known by its massive quality , thick walls , round arches , sturdy pillars , groin vaults , large towers and decorative arcading . Each building has clearly defined forms , frequently of very regular , symmetrical plan ; the overall appearance is one of simplicity when compared with the Gothic buildings that were to follow . The style can be identified right across Europe , despite regional characteristics and different materials .   Many castles were built during this period , but they are greatly outnumbered by churches . The most significant are the great abbey churches , many of which are still standing , more or less complete and frequently in use.Bannister Fletcher , A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method . The enormous quantity of churches built in the Romanesque period was succeeded by the still busier period of Gothic architecture , which partly or entirely rebuilt most Romanesque churches in prosperous areas like England and Portugal . The largest groups of Romanesque survivors are in areas that were less prosperous in subsequent periods , including parts of southern France , northern Spain and rural Italy . Survivals of unfortified Romanesque secular houses and palaces , and the domestic quarters of monasteries are far rarer , but these used and adapted the features found in church buildings , on a domestic scale .   Definition   According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word `` Romanesque '' means `` descended from Roman '' and was first used in English to designate what are now called Romance languages ( first cited 1715 ) . The French term `` '' was first used in the architectural sense by archaeologist Charles de Gerville in a letter of 18 December 1818 to Auguste Le Prévost to describe what Gerville sees as a debased Roman architecture . In 1824 Gerville 's friend Arcisse de Caumont adopted the label `` '' to describe the `` degraded '' European architecture from the 5th to the 13th centuries , in his Essai sur l'architecture religieuse du moyen-âge , particulièrement en Normandie , at a time when the actual dates of many of the buildings so described had not been ascertained : Jean Hubert , Romanesque Art .   The first use in a published work is in William Gunn 's An Inquiry into the Origin and Influence of Gothic Architecture ( London 1819 ) . The word was used by Gunn to describe the style that was identifiably Medieval and prefigured the Gothic , yet maintained the rounded Roman arch and thus appeared to be a continuation of the Roman tradition of building .   The term is now used for the more restricted period from the late 10th to 12th centuries . The term `` Pre-romanesque '' is sometimes applied to architecture in Germany of the Carolingian and Ottonian periods and Visigothic , Mozarab and Asturian constructions between the 8th and the 10th centuries in the Iberian Peninsula while `` First Romanesque '' is applied to buildings in north of Italy and Spain and parts of France that have Romanesque features but pre-date the influence of the Abbey of Cluny .

He was born in Stanmore , New South Wales and won a scholarship to study law at the University of Melbourne . Holt went into business as a solicitor , during which time he joined the United Australia Party ( UAP ) . In 1935 , aged just 27 , he was elected for Fawkner . Holt spent 32 years in Parliament , including many years as a senior Cabinet Minister , but was Prime Minister for only 22 months before he disappeared in December 1967 while swimming at Cheviot Beach near Portsea , Victoria , and was presumed drowned .   As Minister for Immigration ( 1949–1956 ) , Holt was responsible for the relaxation of the White Australia policy and as Treasurer under Menzies , he initiated major fiscal reforms including the establishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia , and launched and guided the process to convert Australia to decimal currency . As Prime Minister , he oversaw landmark changes including the decision not to devalue the Australian dollar in line with the British pound , and the 1967 constitutional referendum in which an overwhelming majority of Australians voted in favour of giving the Commonwealth power to legislate specifically for indigenous Australians . He controversially expanded Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War , with the slogan `` All the way with LBJ '' .   Early life   Born in Stanmore , New South Wales on 5 August 1908 , Holt was the elder son of Thomas and Olive ( née Williams ) . He and his brother Cliff ( Clifford Thomas Holt , born 1910 ) , spent their early life in Sydney , attending three different schools . In 1918 , Thomas Holt divorced Olive and went to work with the Hugh D. McIntosh , manager of the Tivoli theatre circuit . He later became the Tivoli-J C Williamson representative in London and New York . Meanwhile , he enrolled his sons as boarders at Wesley College in Melbourne .   In 1924 , when Holt was sixteen , his mother died and he did not attend her funeral . A formative event was his singing performance at his school 's annual Speech Night in December 1926 . None of his family were present , and he never forgot the loneliness he felt that night .   Holt won a scholarship to Queen 's College at the University of Melbourne and began his law degree in 1927 . He excelled in many areas of university life – he won College 'Blues ' for cricket and Australian rules football , as well as the College Oratory and Essay Prize . A member of the Melbourne Inter-University Debating team and the United Australia Organization ' A ' Grade debating team , he was president of both the Sports and Social Club and the Law Students ' Society .   Holt graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1930 . He was admitted to the Victorian Bar in November 1932 and served his articles with the Melbourne firm of Fink , Best & Miller , but the Great Depression meant that he was unable to find work as a barrister . His father , based in London at the time , wanted him to further his studies in England , but the worsening economy also made this impossible . Instead , in 1933 , Holt went into sole practice as a solicitor . He later entered into a partnership , which became the firm of Holt , Graham & Newman , which Holt remained with until 1963 .   While at university , Holt had met Zara Kate Dickins . In 1934 they were contemplating marriage , but , after a quarrel , they split up . Zara travelled overseas , meeting Captain James Fell , a British Army officer stationed in India , whom she married in March 1935 . Her first son Nicholas was born in 1937 , followed by twin boys Sam and Andrew , born in 1939 . Author Tom Frame has suggested that Holt was the father of the twins . Zara and Fell subsequently divorced , and she married Holt in 1946 . Although they remained married until Holt 's death in 1967 , Zara later commented that Holt had had a number of extramarital affairs .   Meanwhile , Thomas Holt married Lola Thring , the daughter of his business partner F. W. Thring , in 1936 . He died in 1945 .

Publications such as EG use it to classify endgame types and to index endgame studies .   The code is named after Richard Guy , Hugh Blandford and John Roycroft . The first two devised the original system ( the Guy–Blandford code ) using different figures to represent the number of pieces . Roycroft suggested to count one for a white piece and three for a black piece in order to make the code easier to memorise .   Definition   In the GBR code , every chess position is represented by six digits , in the following format :   abcd.ef   * a = queens  * b = rooks  * c = bishops  * d = knights  * e = white pawns  * f = black pawns   For the first four digits , each white piece counts as 1 , and each black piece counts as 3 . Thus , for example , if White has two knights and Black has one knight , numeral d 1 + 1 + 3  5 . If that is all the material other than the kings , the position is classified 0005 . Values 0 through 8 represent all normal permutations of force ; 9 is used if either side has promoted material .   The last two digits of the code represent the number of white and black pawns , respectively .   Usage   GBR code can be used to refer to a general class of material . For example , the endgame of two knights against pawn ( as famously analysed by A.A. Troitsky , leading to his discovery of the Troitsky line ) , is GBR class 0002.01 .   When indexing or referring to specific positions , rather than generalised material imbalances , the code may be extended in various ways . Two common ones are to prefix `` + '' to indicate the stipulation `` White to play and win '' or `` '' for `` White to play and draw '' ; and to suffix the position of the white and black kings . With these additions , the position to the right , a draw study by Leonid Kubbel ( First Prize , Shakhmaty , 1925 ) , is classified as  0323.12g3g1 . ( The solution is : 1.Bf2+ Kh1 2.h7 c2+ 3.Be3 Rxe3+ 4.Kf2 Rh3 5.Bd5+ cxd5 6.hxg8Q Rh2+ 7.Kf3 c1  Q 8.Qg2+ Rxg2 . ) The positions of other pieces can also be added ; this produces a notation that provides the same information as Forsyth–Edwards Notation .   Examples of GBR code"], [8, "The piano is a musical instrument played using a keyboard , which is a row of keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands . Invented in about 1700 ( the exact date is uncertain ) , the piano is widely employed in classical , jazz , traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances , accompaniment , and for composing and rehearsal . Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones . With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed . The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced .   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments . The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe . During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings . By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key . Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case , soundboard , bridge , and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings .   Invention   The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori ( 1655–1731 ) of Padua , Italy , who was employed by Ferdinando de ' Medici , Grand Prince of Tuscany , as the Keeper of the Instruments ; he was an expert harpsichord maker , and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments .

It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in Latin American football . The tournament is named in honor of the Libertadores ( Spanish and Portuguese for liberators ) , the main leaders of the South American wars of independence , so a literal translation of its name into English would be `` Liberators of America Cup '' .   The tournament is currently sponsored by Bridgestone and is thus known as the Copa Bridgestone Libertadores . The competition has had several different formats over its lifetime . At the beginning , only the champions of the South American leagues participated . In 1966 , the runners-up of the South American leagues began to join . In 1998 , Mexican teams were invited to compete , and have contested regularly since 2000 , when the tournament was expanded from 20 to 32 teams . Today at least three clubs per country compete in the tournament , while Argentina and Brazil each have five clubs participating . Traditionally , a group stage has always been used but the number of teams per group has varied several times .   In the present format , the tournament consists of six stages , with the first stage taking place in early February . The six surviving teams from the first stage join 26 teams in the second stage , in which there are eight groups consisting of four teams each . The eight group winners and eight runners-up enter the final four stages , better known as the knockout stages , which ends with the finals anywhere between June and August . The winner of the Copa Libertadores becomes eligible to play in the FIFA Club World Cup and the Recopa Sudamericana .   Independiente of Argentina are the most successful club in the cup 's history , having won the tournament seven times . Argentine clubs have accumulated the most victories with 23 wins , while Brazil has the largest number of different winning teams , with a total of 10 clubs having won the title . The cup has been won by 24 different clubs , 13 of which have won the title more than once , and won consecutively by six clubs . The defending champions were Argentine side River Plate , who won their third title after beating Tigres UANL of Mexico .   History   The clashes for the Copa Río de La Plata between the champions of Argentina and Uruguay kindled the idea of a continental competition in the 1930s . In 1948 , the South American Championship of Champions ( ) , the most direct precursor to the Copa Libertadores , was played and organized by Chilean club Colo-Colo after years of planning and organization . Held in Santiago , it brought together the champions of each nation 's top national leagues . The tournament was won by Vasco da Gama of Brazil .   In 1958 , the basis and format of the competition was created by Peñarol 's board leaders . On March 5 , 1959 , at the 24th South American Congress held in Buenos Aires , the competition was approved by the International Affairs Committee . In 1966 , it was named in honor of the heroes of South American liberation , such as José Gervasio Artigas , Bernardo O'Higgins , José de San Martín , Pedro I , and Simón Bolívar , among others .   Beginnings : 1960–1969   The first edition of the Copa Libertadores took place in 1960 . Seven teams participated : Bahia of Brazil , Jorge Wilstermann of Bolivia , Millonarios of Colombia , Olimpia of Paraguay , Peñarol of Uruguay , San Lorenzo of Argentina and Universidad de Chile . All these teams were domestic champions of their respective leagues in 1959 . The first Copa Libertadores match took place on April 19 , 1960 . It was won by Peñarol , who defeated Jorge Wilstermann 7–1 . The first goal in Copa Libertadores history was scored by Carlos Borges of Peñarol . The Uruguayans won the first ever edition , defeating Olimpia in the finals , and successfully defended the title in 1961 . The Copa Libertadores did not receive international attention until its third edition , when the sublime football of a Santos team led by Pelé , considered by some the best club team of all time , earned worldwide admiration . Os Santásticos , also known as O Balé Branco ( the white ballet ) won the title in 1962 defeating defending champions Peñarol"], [10, "Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound with the formula . In its pure form , it is a colourless liquid , slightly more viscous than water ; however , for safety reasons it is normally used as a solution . Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide ( a compound with an oxygen–oxygen single bond ) and finds use as a weak oxidizer , bleaching agent and disinfectant . Concentrated hydrogen peroxide , or `` high-test peroxide '' , is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry .   Hydrogen peroxide is often described as being `` water but with one more oxygen atom '' , a description that can give the incorrect impression of significant chemical similarity between the two compounds . While they have a similar melting point and appearance , pure hydrogen peroxide will explode if heated to boiling , will cause serious contact burns to the skin and can set materials alight on contact . For these reasons it is usually handled as a dilute solution ( household grades are typically 3–6 % in the U.S. and somewhat higher in Europe ) . Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond .   Structure and properties   Properties   The boiling point of has been extrapolated as being 150.2 °C , approximately 50 °C higher than water . In practice hydrogen peroxide will undergo potentially explosive thermal decomposition if heated to this temperature . It may be safely distilled at lower temperatures under reduced pressure .   Aqueous solutions   In aqueous solutions hydrogen peroxide differs from the pure material due to the effects of hydrogen bonding between water and hydrogen peroxide molecules . Hydrogen peroxide and water form a eutectic mixture , exhibiting freezing-point depression ; pure water has a melting point of 0 °C and pure hydrogen peroxide of −0.43 °C , but a 50 % ( by volume ) solution of the two freezes at −51 °C . The boiling point of the same mixtures is also depressed in relation with the mean of both boiling points ( 125.1 °C ) . It occurs at 114 °C . This boiling point is 14 °C greater than that of pure water and 36.2 °C less than that of pure hydrogen peroxide .   Structure   Hydrogen peroxide ( ) is a nonplanar molecule with ( twisted ) C2 symmetry . Although the O−O bond is a single bond , the molecule has a relatively high rotational barrier of 2460 cm−1 ( 29.45 kJ/mol ) ; for comparison , the rotational barrier for ethane is 12.5 kJ/mol . The increased barrier is ascribed to repulsion between the lone pairs of the adjacent oxygen atoms and results in hydrogen peroxide displaying atropisomerism .   The molecular structures of gaseous and crystalline are significantly different . This difference is attributed to the effects of hydrogen bonding , which is absent in the gaseous state . Crystals of are tetragonal with the space group D'P4121 .   Comparison with analogues   Hydrogen peroxide has several structural analogues with Hm−X−X−Hn bonding arrangements ( water also shown for comparison ) . It has the highest ( theoretical ) boiling point of this series ( X = O , N , S ) . Its melting point is also fairly high , being comparable to that of hydrazine and water , with only hydroxylamine crystallising significantly more readily , indicative of particularly strong hydrogen bonding . Diphosphane and hydrogen disulfide exhibit only weak hydrogen bonding and have little chemical similarity to hydrogen peroxide . All of these analogues are thermodynamically unstable . Structurally , the analogues all adopt similar skewed structures , due to repulsion between adjacent lone pairs .   Discovery   Hydrogen peroxide was first described in 1818 by Louis Jacques Thénard , who produced it by treating barium peroxide with nitric acid . An improved version of this process used hydrochloric acid , followed by addition of sulfuric acid to precipitate the barium sulfate byproduct . Thénard 's process was used from the end of the 19th century until the middle of the 20th century .   Pure hydrogen peroxide was long believed to be unstable , as early attempts to separate it from the water , which is present during synthesis , all failed . This instability was due to traces of impurities ( transition-metal salts ) , which catalyze the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide . Pure hydrogen peroxide was first obtained in 1894 — almost 80 years after its discovery — by Richard Wolffenstein , who produced it by vacuum distillation .   Determination of the molecular structure of hydrogen peroxide"], [11, "Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash . Various grains ( which may be malted ) are used for different varieties , including barley , corn ( maize ) , rye , and wheat . Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks , generally made of charred white oak .   Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types . The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains , distillation , and aging in wooden barrels .   Etymology   The word whisky ( or whiskey ) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce ( or uisge ) meaning `` water '' ( now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic , and uisge in Scottish Gaelic ) . Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae ( `` water of life '' ) . This was translated to Classical Gaelic as / `` water of life '' . Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe ( 1581 ) , usquebaugh ( 1610 ) , usquebath ( 1621 ) , and usquebae ( 1715 ) .   Names and spellings   Much is made of the word 's two spellings : whisky and whiskey . There are two schools of thought on the issue . One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word , indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer ( like the difference between color and colour ; or recognize and recognise ) , and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described . There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label , the spelling on the label should not be altered . Some writers refer to `` whisk ( e ) y '' or `` whisky/whiskey '' to acknowledge the variation .   The spelling whiskey is common in Ireland and the United States , while whisky is used in all other whisky producing countries . In the US , the usage has not always been consistent . From the late eighteenth century to the mid twentieth century , American writers used both spellings interchangeably until the introduction of newspaper style guides . Since the 1960s , American writers have increasingly used whiskey as the accepted spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and whisky for aged grain spirits made outside the US . However , some prominent American brands , such as George Dickel , Maker 's Mark , and Old Forester ( all made by different companies ) , use the whisky spelling on their labels , and the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits , the legal regulations for spirit in the US , also use the whisky spelling throughout .   `` Scotch '' is the internationally recognized term for `` Scotch whisky '' .   History   It is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC , with perfumes and aromatics being distilled , but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretation of evidence . The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD , but these were not distillations of alcohol . The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks , and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century , but again these were not distillations of alcohol . Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins , with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century.Book [ https : //books.google.com/books ? id  XeqWOkKYn28C & printsecfrontcover A Short History of the Art of Distillation ] , by Robert James Forbes ( year 1948 ) .

The earliest records of the distillation of alcohol are in Italy in the 13th century , where alcohol was distilled from wine . An early description of the technique was given by Ramon Llull ( 1232 – 1315 ) . Its use spread through medieval monasteries , largely for medicinal purposes , such as the treatment of colic and smallpox .   The art of distillation spread to Ireland and Scotland no"], [12, "Speculation abounded over potential nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States by Ronald Reagan even before his presidency officially began , due to the advanced ages of several justices , and Reagan 's own highlighting of Supreme Court nominations as a campaign issue . Reagan had promised `` to appoint only those opposed to abortion and the 'judicial activism ' of the Warren and Burger Courts '' . Conversely , some opposed to Reagan argued that he could `` appoint as many as five Justices '' and would `` use the opportunity to stack the Court against women , minorities and social justice '' .   Sandra Day O'Connor nomination   During his 1980 campaign , Reagan pledged that , if given the opportunity , he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice . That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart . O'Connor was approved by the Senate by a vote of 99-0 on September 21 , 1981 . Senator Max Baucus ( D-MT ) did not vote .   William Rehnquist elevation   In his second term , Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren Burger as Chief Justice . Rehnquist 's confirmation was largely split along party lines , showing that he had not improved his standing among Senate Democrats since his contentious 1971 nomination to the Court . Rehnquist 's elevation to Chief Justice was approved by the Senate by a vote of 65-33 on September 17 , 1986 . Senators Jake Garn ( R-UT ) and Barry Goldwater ( R-AZ ) did not vote . Senator Alan Simpson ( R-WY ) made public note on the Senate floor that Senator Garn 's vote would have been to confirm had he been present .   Democratic Senators who voted against Rehnquist 's confirmation as an Associate Justice in 1971 and as Chief Justice in 1986 were Alan Cranston ( CA ) , Daniel Inouye ( HI ) , Edward M. Kennedy ( MA ) and Claiborne Pell ( RI ) . Two Democrats who voted for Rehnquist 's nomination as Associate Justice voted against his nomination as Chief Justice , Thomas Eagleton ( MO ) and Robert Byrd ( WV ) .   Antonin Scalia nomination   After deciding to elevate Rehnquist to Chief Justice , Reagan considered both Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat left by Rehnquist 's elevation , but ultimately chose the younger and more charismatic Scalia . Scalia was approved by the Senate by a vote of 98-0 on September 17 , 1986 . Senators Jake Garn ( R-UT ) and Barry Goldwater ( R-AZ ) did not vote .   Anthony Kennedy nomination   Robert Bork selection   Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell was a moderate , and even before his expected retirement on June 27 , 1987 , Senate Democrats had asked liberal leaders to form `` a solid phalanx '' to oppose whomever President Ronald Reagan nominated to replace him , assuming it would tilt the court rightward ; Democrats warned Reagan there would be a fight . Reagan considered appointing Utah Senator Orrin Hatch to the seat , but Congress had approved $ 6,000 pay raises for Supreme Court Justices in February , raising a problem under the Ineligibility Clause of the United States Constitution , which prohibits a member of Congress from accepting an appointment for which the pay had been increased during that member 's term . A memorandum by Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper rejected the notion that a Saxbe fix—a rollback of the salary for the position—could satisfy the Ineligibility Clause . Hatch had been on the short list of two finalists with Robert Bork , but after the Ineligibility Clause had been brought to light , Hatch was no longer under consideration . Reagan nominated Robert Bork for the seat on July 1 , 1987 .   Within 45 minutes of Bork 's nomination to the Court , Ted Kennedy ( D-MA ) took to the Senate floor with a strong condemnation of Bork in a nationally televised speech , declaring , `` Robert Bork 's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions , blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters , rogue police could break down citizens ' doors in midnight raids , schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution , writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government , and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens .

He was the first English King of Ireland , and continued the nominal claim by English monarchs to the Kingdom of France . Henry was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty , succeeding his father , Henry VII .   Henry is known for his consequential role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church , besides his six marriages and many extramarital affairs , as well as his effort to obtain an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon , which led to conflict with the Pope . His disagreements with the Pope led Henry to separate the Church of England from papal authority , with himself as king and as the Supreme Head of the Church of England ; the disputes also led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries . His principal dispute was with papal authority rather than with doctrinal matters , and he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings despite his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church . Henry oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . He is also well known for a long personal rivalry with both Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , with whom he frequently warred .   Domestically , Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution , ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings to England . Besides asserting the sovereign 's supremacy over the Church of England , thus initiating the English Reformation , he greatly expanded royal power . Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent , and those accused were often executed without a formal trial , by means of bills of attainder . He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers , some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour . People such as Thomas Wolsey , Thomas More , Thomas Cromwell , Richard Rich , and Thomas Cranmer figured prominently in Henry 's administration . He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert money into royal revenue that was formerly paid to Rome . Despite the influx of money from these sources , Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars .   His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated , and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne '' . Besides ruling with considerable power , he was also an author and composer . His desire to provide England with a male heir stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly from his belief that a daughter would be unable to consolidate Tudor power and maintain the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses . This led to the two things for which Henry is most remembered : his six marriages and his break with the Pope ( who would not allow an annulment of Henry 's first marriage ) . As he aged , Henry became severely obese and his health suffered , contributing to his death in 1547 . He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful , egotistical , harsh , and insecure king . He was succeeded by his son Edward VI .   Early years   Born 28June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich , London , Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York . Of the young Henry 's six siblings , only three – Arthur , Prince of Wales ; Margaret ; and Mary – survived infancy . He was baptised by Richard Fox , the Bishop of Exeter , at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace . In 1493 , at the age of two , Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports . He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three , and was inducted into the Order of the Bath soon after . The day after the ceremony he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches . In May 1495 , he was appointed"], [14, "The English term enlightenment is the western translation of the term bodhi , `` awakening '' , which was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of Max Müller . It has the western connotation of a sudden insight into a transcendental truth .   The term is also being used to translate several other Buddhist terms and concepts used to denote insight ( prajna , kensho and satori ) ; knowledge ( vidhya ) ; the `` blowing out '' ( Nirvana ) of disturbing emotions and desires and the subsequent freedom or release ( vimutti ) ; and the attainment of Buddhahood , as exemplified by Gautama Buddha .   What exactly constituted the Buddha 's awakening is unknown . It may probably have involved the knowledge that liberation was attained by the combination of mindfulness and dhyāna , applied to the understanding of the arising and ceasing of craving . The relation between dhyana and insight is a core problem in the study of Buddhism , and is one of the fundamentals of Buddhist practice .   In the western world the concept of ( spiritual ) enlightenment has taken on a romantic meaning . It has become synonymous with self-realization and the true self and false self , being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning. , , ,   Translation   Robert S. Cohen notes that the majority of English books on Buddhism use the term `` enlightenment '' to translate the term bodhi . The root budh , from which both bodhi and Buddha are derived , means `` to wake up '' or `` to recover consciousness '' . Cohen notes that bodhi is not the result of an illumination , but of a path of realization , or coming to understanding . The term `` enlightenment '' is event-oriented , whereas the term `` awakening '' is process-oriented . The western use of the term `` enlighten '' has Christian roots , as in Calvin 's `` It is God alone who enlightens our minds to perceive his truths '' .   Early 19th century bodhi was translated as `` intelligence '' . The term `` enlighten '' was first being used in 1835 , in an English translation of a French article , while the first recorded use of the term 'enlightenment ' is credited ( by the Oxford English Dictionary ) to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal ( February , 1836 ) . In 1857 The Times used the term `` the Enlightened '' for the Buddha in a short article , which was reprinted the following year by Max Müller . Thereafter , the use of the term subsided , but reappeared with the publication of Max Müller 's Chips from a german Workshop , which included a reprint from the Times-article . The book was translated 1969 into German , using the term `` der Erleuchtete '' . Max Müller was an essentialist , who believed in a natural religion , and saw religion as an inherent capacity of human beings . `` Enlightenment '' was a means to capture natural religious truths , as distinguished from mere mythology .   By the mid-1870s it had become commonplace to call the Buddha `` enlightened '' , and by the end of the 1880s the terms `` enlightened '' and `` enlightenment '' dominated the English literature .   Terms   Insight   Bodhi   Bodhi ( Sanskrit , Pāli ) , from the verbal root budd , `` to awaken '' , `` to understand '' , means literally `` to have woken up and understood '' . According to Johannes Bronkhorst , Tillman Vetter , and K.R . Norman , bodhi was at first not specified . K.R . Norman :   According to Norman , bodhi may basically have meant the knowledge that nibbana was attained , due to the practice of dhyana . Originally only `` prajna '' may have been mentioned , and Tillman Vetter even concludes that originally dhyana itself was deemed liberating , with the stilling of pleasure of pain in the fourth jhana . Gombrich also argues that the emphasis on insight is a later development .   In Theravada Buddhism , bodhi refers to the realisation of the four stages of enlightenment and becoming an Arahant . In Theravada Buddhism , bodhi is equal to supreme insight , and the realisation of the four noble truths , which leads to deliverance . According to Nyanatiloka ,   This equation of bodhi with the four noble truths is a later development , in response to developments within"], [15, "Brownsville is a city in Haywood County , Tennessee . It is the county seat of Haywood County . Its population as of the 2010 census is 10,292 .   The city is named after General Jacob Jennings Brown , an officer of The War of 1812 . [ http : //www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php ? locIndex  12324 Community Information ]   History   Brownsville 's history is strongly connected with agriculture in the Mid-South . The town is notable for its many well-preserved antebellum homes and multi-generational family owned farms .   Tabernacle Campground , home to the yearly `` camp-meeting '' for descendants of the Rev . Howell Taylor , was established in 1826 , soon after Brownsville was founded .   Brownsville 's synagogue , Temple Adas Israel , was built in 1882 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The building is believed to be the oldest synagogue in Tennessee , and is a rare example of a synagogue built in the Gothic Revival style .   Geography   According to the United States Census Bureau , Brownsville has a total area of , all land .   Brownsville is situated on the southeastern edge of the New Madrid Seismic Zone , an area with a high earthquake risk .   The Hatchie River runs through Brownsville . It is the longest free-flowing tributary of the lower Mississippi , and contains the largest forested floodplain in Tennessee . The river is home to hundreds of species of fish , including 11 species of catfish , and the alligator snapping turtle . The Hatchie River was named by the Nature Conservancy as one of the `` great places '' to save . The Hatchie is also designated as a `` scenic river '' under the Tennessee Wild and Scenic Rivers Act .   Demographics   As of the census of 2000 , there were 10,748 people , 4,105 households , and 2,865 families residing in the city .

More broadly , `` the sea '' is the interconnected system of Earth 's salty , oceanic waters—considered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions . The sea moderates Earth 's climate and has important roles in the water cycle , carbon cycle , and nitrogen cycle . Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory , the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s . The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including the IHO 's four named oceans ( the Atlantic , Pacific , Indian , and Arctic ) and the Southern Ocean ; smaller , second-order sections , such as the Mediterranean , are known as seas .   Owing to the present state of continental drift , the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea ( a ratio of about 2:3 ) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic ( 1:4.7 ) .Reddy , M.P.M . ( 2001 ) [ https : //books.google.com/books ? id  2NC3JmKI7mYC & lpg=PA112 Descriptive Physical Oceanography ] . p. 112 . A.A. Balkema , Leiden . ISBN 90-5410-706-5 . Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5 % by mass , although this can vary in more landlocked waters , near the mouths of large rivers , or at great depths . About 85 % of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride . Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature . Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides , the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun . The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth ( the Coriolis effect ) .   Former changes in the sea levels have left continental shelves , shallow areas in the sea close to land . These nutrient-rich waters teem with life , which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish , but also shellfish , mammals , and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed . The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs . Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales ' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting . Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters : even under enormous depths and pressures , nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem . Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth 's atmosphere ; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea .   The sea is an essential aspect of human trade , travel , mineral extraction , and power generation . This has also made it essential to warfare and left major cities exposed to earthquakes and volcanoes from nearby faults ; powerful tsunami waves ; and hurricanes , typhoons , and cyclones produced in the tropics . This importance and duality has affected human culture , from early sea gods to the epic poetry of Homer to the changes induced by the Columbian Exchange , from Viking funerals to Basho 's haikus to hyperrealist marine art , and inspiring music ranging from the shanties in The Complaynt of Scotland to Rimsky-Korsakov 's `` The Sea and Sinbad 's Ship '' to A-mei 's `` Listen to the Sea '' . It is the scene of leisure activities including swimming , diving , surfing , and sailing . However , population growth , industrialization , and intensive farming have all contributed to present-day marine pollution . Atmospheric carbon dioxide is being absorbed in increasing amounts , lowering its pH in a process known as ocean acidification . The shared nature of the sea has made overfishing an increasing problem .   Definition   Both senses of sea date to Old English ; the larger sense has required a definite article since Early Middle English . As the term has been applied over time , there are no sharp distinctions between seas and oceans , although seas are smaller and are—with the notable exception of the Sargasso Sea created by the North Atlantic Gyre—usually bounded by land on a smaller scale than multiple continents . Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water , but the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake .

The Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states , organised through the Commonwealth Secretariat , and non-governmental organisations , organised through the Commonwealth Foundation .   The Commonwealth dates back to the mid-20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories . It was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 , which established the member states as `` free and equal '' . The symbol of this free association is Queen Elizabeth II who is the Head of the Commonwealth . The Queen is also the monarch of 16 members of the Commonwealth , known as Commonwealth realms . The other Commonwealth members have different heads of state : 32 members are republics and five are monarchies with a different monarch .   Member states have no legal obligation to one another . Instead , they are united by language , history , culture and their shared values of democracy , human rights , and the rule of law . These values are enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter and promoted by the quadrennial Commonwealth Games . On 3 October 2013 , after 48 years of membership , The Gambia became the most recent nation to withdraw from the Commonwealth .   The Commonwealth covers more than 29958050 km2 , almost a quarter of the world 's land area , and spans all six inhabited continents . With an estimated population of 2.328 billion , nearly a third of the world population , the Commonwealth in 2014 produced a nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ) of $ 10.45 trillion , representing 17 % of the gross world product when measured in purchasing power parity ( PPP ) and 14 % of the gross world product when measured nominally .   History   Origin   Queen Elizabeth II , in her address to Canada on Dominion Day in 1959 , pointed out that the confederation of Canada on 1 July 1867 had been the birth of the `` first independent country within the British Empire '' . She declared : `` So , it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of Nations . '' As long ago as 1884 , however , Lord Rosebery , while visiting Australia , had described the changing British Empire—as some of its colonies became more independent—as a `` Commonwealth of Nations '' . Conferences of British and colonial prime ministers occurred periodically from the first one in 1887 , leading to the creation of the Imperial Conferences in 1911 .   The Commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences . A specific proposal was presented by Jan Smuts in 1917 when he coined the term `` the British Commonwealth of Nations '' and envisioned the `` future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence '' at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 by delegates from the Dominions as well as Britain . The term first received imperial statutory recognition in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 , when the term British Commonwealth of Nations was substituted for British Empire in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the Irish Free State .   Dominions   In the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference , Britain and its dominions agreed they were `` equal in status , in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs , though united by common allegiance to the Crown , and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations . '' These aspects to the relationship were formalised by the Statute of Westminster in 1931 , which applied to Canada without the need for ratification , but Australia , New Zealand , and Newfoundland had to ratify the statute for it to take effect . Newfoundland never did , as on 16 February 1934 , with the consent of its parliament , the government of Newfoundland voluntarily ended and governance reverted to direct control from London . Newfoundland later joined Canada as its 10th province in 1949 . Australia and New Zealand ratified the Statute in 1942 and 1947 respectively .   Although the Union of South Africa was not among the Dominions that needed to adopt the Statute of Westminster for it to take effect , two laws—the Status of the Union Act , 1934 , and the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act of 1934—were passed to confirm South Africa 's status"], [18, "Prague ( ; , , ) is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic . It is the 14th largest city in the European Union . It is also the historical capital of Bohemia . Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava River , the city is home to about 1.26 million people , while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million . The city has a temperate climate , with warm summers and chilly winters . Prague has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union .   Prague has been a political , cultural , and economic centre of central Europe with waxing and waning fortunes during its 1,100-year existence . Founded during the Romanesque and flourishing by the Gothic , Renaissance and Baroque eras , Prague was not only the capital of the Czech state , but also the seat of two Holy Roman Emperors and thus also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire . It was an important city to the Habsburg Monarchy and its Austro-Hungarian Empire and after World War I became the capital of Czechoslovakia . The city played major roles in the Bohemian and Protestant Reformation , the Thirty Years ' War , and in 20th-century history , during both World Wars and the post-war Communist era .   Prague is home to a number of famous cultural attractions , many of which survived the violence and destruction of 20th-century Europe . Main attractions include the Prague Castle , the Charles Bridge , Old Town Square with the Prague astronomical clock , the Jewish Quarter , Petřín hill and Vyšehrad . Since 1992 , the extensive historic centre of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites .   The city boasts more than ten major museums , along with numerous theatres , galleries , cinemas , and other historical exhibits . An extensive modern public transportation system connects the city . Also , it is home to a wide range of public and private schools , including Charles University in Prague , the oldest university in Central Europe . Prague is classified as an `` Alpha- '' global city according to GaWC studies , comparable to Vienna , Seoul and Washington , D.C.

Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination , and the city receives more than 6.4 million international visitors annually , . Prague is the fifth most visited European city after London , Paris , Istanbul and Rome . Prague 's low cost of living makes it a popular destination for expats relocating to Europe .   History   During the thousand years of its existence , the city grew from a settlement stretching from Prague Castle in the north to the fort of Vyšehrad in the south , becoming the multicultural capital of a modern European state , the Czech Republic , a member state of the European Union .   Early history   The area on which Prague was founded was settled as early as the Paleolithic age . According to the Jewish historian and chronicler David Solomon Ganz ( 1541–1613 ) , author of a book published in Hebrew , entitled Tzemach Dovid , the city was founded by an ancient king , Boyya ( Boiia ) , in c. 1306 BC.Tzemach Dovid , David Solomon Ganz , Warsaw , 1878 , p. 71 ( [ http : //www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx ? req  21930 & st & pgnum  72 & hilitep . 72 ] in pdf ) .

It is the 17th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series . It stars Rod Taylor and Cate Bauer as , respectively , the voices of Pongo and Perdita , its canine protagonists , and Betty Lou Gerson as the voice of Cruella de Vil , its antagonist who kidnaps their puppies .   The film was originally released to theaters on January 25 , 1961 , by Buena Vista Distribution . Upon release , it was a box office hit , successfully pulling the studio out of the financial setbacks caused by Sleeping Beauty , a costlier production released two years prior . Aside from its box office revenue , its commercial success was due to the employment of inexpensive animation techniques—such as using xerography during the process of inking and painting traditional animation cels—that kept production costs down . It was reissued to cinemas four times : in 1969 , 1979 , 1985 and 1991 . The 1991 reissue was the twentieth highest earning film of the year for domestic earnings . It was remade into a live action film in 1996 .   Plot   Songwriter Roger Radcliffe lives in a bachelor flat in London , along with his dalmatian , Pongo .

The Olympic Games are considered to be the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart .   Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority .   The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . As a result , the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games . World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916 , 1940 , and 1944 Games . Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games .   The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations ( IFs ) , National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) , and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games . As the decision-making body , the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games , and organizes and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter . The IOC also determines the Olympic program , consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games . There are several Olympic rituals and symbols , such as the Olympic flag and torch , as well as the opening and closing ceremonies . Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events . The first , second , and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals : gold , silver , and bronze , respectively .   The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented . This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies , including boycotts , doping , bribery , and a terrorist attack in 1972 . Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame . The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world .   Ancient Olympics   The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia , Greece . Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece . These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration , horse and chariot racing events . It has been widely written that during the Games , all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished . This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce . This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars . The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus . The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend ; one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games . According to legend , it was Heracles who first called the Games `` Olympic '' and established the custom of holding them every four years . The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labors , he built the Olympic Stadium as an honor to Zeus . Following its completion , he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a `` stadion '' ( , Latin : stadium , `` stage '' ) , which later became a unit of distance . The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is"], [22, "The Habit of Art is a 2009 play by English playwright Alan Bennett , centred on a fictional meeting between W. H.

The performance of April 22 , 2010 was broadcast to more than 200 cinemas worldwide by [ http : //www.ntlive.com NTLive ] .   Synopsis   `` The Habit of Art '' centres on Fitz , Henry , Tim and Donald , who are actors rehearsing a play called Caliban 's Day . ( The title reflects Auden 's view that The Tempest was incomplete and Caliban should have an epilogue . ) The director has been called away , so they have a run-through/workshop directed by the stage manager , Kay , in the presence of the playwright , Neil .   `` Caliban 's Day '' is about a fictitious meeting in 1973 in Auden 's rooms at Oxford , between Auden ( Fitz ) in his latter years and Britten ( Henry ) . Auden has hired a rent boy , Stuart ( Tim ) and when Humphrey Carpenter ( Donald ) - who will write biographies of both Auden and Britten after their deaths - arrives to interview him , Auden mistakes him for Stuart . Britten has been auditioning boys for Death in Venice nearby , and arrives unexpectedly ( their first meeting in 25 years after they fell out over the failure of their opera Paul Bunyan ) . He wants to discuss his misgivings about the paedophilic theme of Death in Venice and the light that may cast on his own life , but Auden assumes Britten wants him to write the libretto .   The characters intermittently break out of the rehearsal to discuss the play , how accurately/harshly it should treat Auden 's failings , the actor 's craft and many other issues raised by Auden , Britten and the play .

In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms , united by Æthelstan ( r. 927–939 ) , became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre .   Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066–1154 , Plantagenet 1154–1485 , Tudor 1485–1603 and Stuart 1603–1714 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649–1660 ) .  Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became `` more English in nature '' ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor .   The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327–1377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558–1603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World .   From the accession of James I in 1603 , the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland . Under the Stuarts , the kingdom plunged into civil war , which culminated in the execution of Charles I in 1649 . The monarchy returned in 1660 , but the Civil War established the precedent that an English monarch can not govern without the consent of Parliament , although this concept became legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 .  From this time the kingdom of England , as well as its successor state the United Kingdom , functioned in effect as a constitutional monarchy.The Constitution of the United Kingdom , with the reservation that it is `` uncodified '' , is taken to be based in the Bill of Rights 1689 . On 1 May 1707 , under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707 , the kingdoms of England and Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain .   Name   The Anglo-Saxons referred to themselves as the Engle or the Angelcynn , originally names of the Angles . They called their land Engla land , meaning `` land of the English '' ,  by Æthelweard Latinized Anglia , from an original Anglia vetus , the purported homeland of the Angles ( called Angulus by Bede ) . The name Engla land became England by haplology during the Middle English period ( Engle-land , Engelond ) .

Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache , drowsiness , concentration problems , dry mouth , dizziness , fatigue , gastrointestinal distress ( e.g. , vomiting ) , absence of hunger , sweating , nausea , hyper-excitability and anxiety .   While the causes of a hangover are still poorly understood , several factors are known to be involved including acetaldehyde accumulation , changes in the immune system and glucose metabolism , dehydration , metabolic acidosis , disturbed prostaglandin synthesis , increased cardiac output , vasodilation , sleep deprivation and malnutrition . Beverage-specific effects of additives or by-products such as congeners in alcoholic beverages also play an important role . The symptoms occur typically after the intoxicating effect of the alcohol begins to wear off , generally the morning after a night of heavy drinking .   Though many possible remedies and `` folk cures '' have been suggested , there is no compelling evidence to suggest that any are effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover . Avoiding alcohol or drinking in moderation are the most effective ways to avoid a hangover .  The socioeconomic consequences and health risks of alcohol hangover include workplace absenteeism , impaired job performance , reduced productivity and poor academic achievement . A hangover may also compromise potentially dangerous daily activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery .   Signs and symptoms   An alcohol hangover is associated with a variety of symptoms that may include drowsiness , headache , concentration problems , dry mouth , dizziness , gastrointestinal complaints , fatigue , sweating , nausea , hyper-excitability , anxiety and a feeling of general discomfort that may last more than 24 hours . Alcohol hangover symptoms develop when blood alcohol concentration falls considerably and peak when it returns to almost zero . Hangover symptoms validated in controlled studies include general malaise , thirst , headache , feeling dizzy or faint , tiredness , loss of appetite , nausea , stomach ache , and feeling as though one ’ s heart is racing . Some symptoms such as changes in sleep pattern and gastrointestinal distress are attributed to direct effects of the alcohol intoxication , or withdrawal symptoms . Drowsiness and impaired cognitive function are the two dominant features of alcohol hangover .   Causes   The processes which lead to hangovers are still poorly understood . Several pathophysiological changes may give rise to the alcohol hangover including increased levels of acetaldehyde , hormonal alterations of the cytokine pathways and decrease of the availability of glucose . Additional associated phenomena are dehydration , metabolic acidosis , disturbed prostaglandin synthesis , increased cardiac output , vasodilation , sleep deprivation and insufficient eating . Some complex organic molecules found in alcoholic beverages known as congeners may play an important role in producing hangover effects because some , such as methanol , are metabolized to the notably toxic substances formaldehyde and formic acid .   Pathophysiology   After being ingested , ethanol is first converted to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and then to acetic acid by oxidation process . These reactions also convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+ ) to its reduced form NADH in a redox reaction . By causing an imbalance of the NAD+/NADH redox system , alcoholic beverages make normal bodily functions more difficult . Consequences of the alcohol induced redox changes in the human body include increased triglyceride production , increased amino acid catabolism , inhibition of the citric acid cycle , lactic acidosis , ketoacidosis , hyperuricemia , disturbance in cortisol and androgen metabolism and increased fibrogenesis.The metabolism of glucose and insulin are also influenced . However , recent studies showed no significant correlation between hangover severity and the concentrations of various hormones , electrolytes , free fatty acids , triglycerides , lactate , ketone bodies , cortisol , and glucose in blood and urine samples .   Alcohol also induces the CYP2E1 enzyme , which metabolizes ethanol and other substances into more reactive toxins . In particular , in binge drinking the enzyme is activated and plays a role in creating a harmful condition known as oxidative stress which can lead to cell death .   Acetaldehyde   Acetaldehyde , the first by-product of ethanol , is between 10 and 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself and can remain at an elevated plateau for many hours after initial ethanol consumption . In addition , certain genetic factors can amplify the negative"], [25, "An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron ( proton or hydrogen ion H+ ) , or , alternatively , capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair ( a Lewis acid ) .   The first category of acids is the proton donors or Brønsted acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ .   Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in acid ' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic .   Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . As these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial sense ) can be solutions or pure substances , and can be derived from acids ( in the strict sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid .   The second category of acids are Lewis acids , which form a covalent bond with an electron pair . An example is boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( NH3 ) . Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( H+ ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs . However , hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other Brønsted-Lowry acids can not form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids . Conversely , many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry acids . In modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid .   Definitions and concepts   Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids .   Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions , or can be dissolved in water , so the Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant .   The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton ( H+ ) from an acid to a base .   Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions . Interestingly , although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids , they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms .   Arrhenius acids   The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions ( H+ ) or protons in 1884 . An Arrhenius acid is a substance that , when added to water , increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water . Note that chemists often write H+ ( aq ) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus , a proton , does not exist alone in water , it exists as the hydronium ion , H3O+ . Thus , an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium"], [26, 'The radish ( Raphanus sativus ) is an edible root vegetable of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times . Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world , being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable . They have numerous varieties , varying in size , flavor , color , and length of time they take to mature . Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants , including glucosinolate , myrosinase , and isothiocyanate . They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases . They germinate quickly and grow rapidly , smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month , while larger daikon varieties take several months . Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop . Some radishes are grown for their seeds ; daikon , for instance , may be grown for oil production . Others are used for sprouting and both roots and leaves are sometimes served cooked or cold .   History   Varieties of radish are now broadly distributed around the world , but almost no archeological records are available to help determine their early history and domestication . However , scientists tentatively locate the origin of Raphanus sativus in southeast Asia , as this is the only region where truly wild forms have been discovered . India , central China , and central Asia appear to have been secondary centers where differing forms were developed . Radishes enter the historical record in . Greek and Roman agriculturalists of the gave details of small , large , round , long , mild , and sharp varieties . The radish seems to have been one of the first European crops introduced to the Americas . A German botanist reported radishes of 100 lb and roughly 3 ft in length in 1544 , although the only variety of that size today is the Japanese Sakurajima radish . The large , mild , and white East Asian form was developed in China , but is mostly associated in the West with the Japanese daikon , owing to Japanese agricultural development and larger exports .   Description   Radishes are annual or biennial brassicaceous crops grown for their swollen tap roots which can be globular , tapering , or cylindrical . The root skin colour ranges from white through pink , red , purple , yellow , and green to black , but the flesh is usually white . Smaller types have a few leaves about 13 cm long with round roots up to in diameter or more slender , long roots up to 7 cm long . Both of these are normally eaten raw in salads . A longer root form , including oriental radishes , daikon or mooli , and winter radishes , grows up to 60 cm long with foliage about 60 cm high with a spread of 45 cm . The flesh of radishes harvested timely is crisp and sweet , but becomes bitter and tough if the vegetable is left in the ground too long . Leaves are arranged in a rosette . They have a lyrate shape , meaning they are divided pinnately with an enlarged terminal lobe and smaller lateral lobes . The white flowers are borne on a racemose inflorescence . The fruits are small pods which can be eaten when young .   The radish is a diploid species , and has 18 chromosomes ( 2n=18 ) .   Cultivation   Radishes are a fast-growing , annual , cool-season crop . The seed germinates in three to four days in moist conditions with soil temperatures between 65 and . Best quality roots are obtained under moderate day lengths with air temperatures in the range 50 to . Under average conditions , the crop matures in 3–4 weeks , but in colder weather , 6–7 weeks may be required .   Radishes grow best in full sun in light , sandy loams , with a soil pH 6.5 to 7.0 , but for late-season crops , a clayey-loam is ideal . Soils that bake dry and form a crust in dry weather are unsuitable and can impair germination . Harvesting periods can be extended by making repeat plantings , spaced a week or two apart . In warmer climates , radishes are normally planted in the autumn . The depth at which seeds are planted affects the size of the root , from 1 cm deep recommended for small radishes to 4 cm for large radishes . During the growing period , the crop needs to be thinned and weeds controlled , and irrigation'], [27, "The Recreation Ground ( commonly the Rec ) is a large open space in the centre of Bath , England , next to the River Avon , which is available to be used by permission from the Recreation Ground Trust for recreational purposes by the public at large but particularly the people of Bath and surrounding areas .

During the summer the rugby ground 's temporary East Stand is removed to make way for cricket on a larger pitch . This cricket pitch is used for local contests and was used by Somerset County Cricket Club until 2011 . [ http : //www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/303.html Cricket Archive ] Recreation Ground , Bath Parts of the eastern area of the Rec are used by Bath Hockey Club , Bath Croquet Club , Bath Drama Club and for some tennis courts . Pitches are available for amateur sports such as Football , Volleyball and Lacrosse . There is a cricket pavilion at the William Street entrance to the ground . The council-run Sports and Leisure Centre is located on the southern edge of the Rec , accessed via North Parade .   In former years the Rec was subject to periodic flooding from the River Avon , but a flood alleviation scheme in the 1960s improved the flow of the river . However , the Rec remains part of the floodplain at risk of occasional flooding . The ground can still get very boggy after heavy rains .   History   In the early part of the 1890s , the land on which the Recreation Ground now lies as well as the North Parade land were part of the Bathwick Estate , which was owned by the Forester family . In 1894 , a lease was granted to the Directors of The Bath and County Recreation Ground Company Limited by Captain G W Forester . This lease allowed work to be carried out on the land which would make it suitable for cricket matches , lawn tennis and archery tournaments , football matches and all other outdoor sports . As part of this work , a cricket pavilion was started on the north side of the ground . The first Bath rugby matches were also played on the ground in 1884 . Three years later , the ground hosted its maiden first-class cricket match , with Somerset County Cricket Club hosting the Gentlemen of Philadelphia as part of the Bath Cricket Festival . The company 's lease was extended for a further 21 years in 1908 , at a rent of £100 per year . Fourteen years later , the land was conveyed to The Bath and County Recreation Ground Company Limited for £6,050 . The company then conveyed the North Parade Land , including a building which was used as an ice skating rink , to Bath Artcraft Limited for £2,500 .   A new lease was granted to Bath F.C . in 1927 , allowing them the use of the land on the west side of ground , along with a Grand Stand , a New ( North ) Stand and a Pavilion , for a term of 25 years . Six years later the lease was surrendered , and a new 50-year lease was granted . In the same year , the Grand Stand was replaced with a new West Stand . This was significantly bomb-damaged during the Second World War . Rebuilding of the stand , at a cost in excess of £12,000 , was met by the War Damage Commission in 1953–54 . The 'Club Room ' building was erected in 1954 , to the west of the North Stand , and during the same year a lease was granted to allow a tennis club to use the north east corner of the ground . In 1956 , the ground was conveyed to the Mayor Aldermen and the Citizens of the City of Bath ( the Corporation ) for £11,155 .   Bath F.C . surrendered their 1933 lease , and were granted a new 75-year lease in 1973 . In 1974 , both the Recreation Ground and the North Parade Land were transferred to Bath City Council , who erected a Sports and Leisure Centre on the south side in 1975 . In 1995 , Bath F.C . were granted a further 75-year lease . Doubts over the legal effect of the 1956 Conveyance were settled in 2002 , when the"], [28, "Watergate was a major political scandal that occurred in the United States in the 1970s , following a break-in at the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington , D.C. and President Richard Nixon 's administration 's attempted cover-up of its involvement . When the conspiracy was discovered and investigated by the U.S. Congress , the Nixon administration 's resistance to its probes led to a constitutional crisis .   The term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration . Those activities included such `` dirty tricks '' as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious . Nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures , using the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , and the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) .   The scandal led to the discovery of multiple abuses of power by the Nixon administration , articles of impeachment , and the resignation of Nixon as President of the United States on August 9 , 1974 . The scandal also resulted in the indictment of 69 people , with trials or pleas resulting in 25 being found guilty and incarcerated , many of whom were Nixon 's top administration officials .   The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex on Saturday , June 17 , 1972 . The FBI investigated and discovered a connection between cash found on the burglars and a slush fund used by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President ( CREEP ) , the official organization of Nixon 's campaign . In July 1973 , evidence mounted against the President 's staff , including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the Senate Watergate Committee . The investigation revealed that President Nixon had a tape-recording system in his offices and that he had recorded many conversations .   After a protracted series of bitter court battles , the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the president was obligated to release the tapes to government investigators , and he eventually complied . These audio recordings implicated the president , revealing he had attempted to cover up activities that took place after the break-in and to use federal officials to deflect the investigation .  Facing near-certain impeachment in the House of Representatives and equally certain conviction by the Senate , Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9 , 1974 . On September 8 , 1974 , his successor , Gerald Ford , pardoned him .   The name `` Watergate '' and the suffix `` -gate '' have since become synonymous with political scandals in the United States and elsewhere .   Wiretapping of the Democratic Party 's headquarters   In January 1972 , G. Gordon Liddy , general counsel to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President ( CREEP ) , presented a campaign intelligence plan to CREEP 's Acting Chairman Jeb Stuart Magruder , Attorney General John Mitchell , and Presidential Counsel John Dean , that involved extensive illegal activities against the Democratic Party . According to Dean , this marked `` the opening scene of the worst political scandal of the twentieth century and the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency . ''   Mitchell viewed the plan as unrealistic . Two months later , he was alleged to have approved a reduced version of the plan , to include burgling the Democratic National Committee 's ( DNC ) headquarters at the Watergate Complex in Washington , D.C.—ostensibly to photograph campaign documents and install listening devices in telephones . Liddy was nominally in charge of the operation , but has since insisted that he was duped by Dean and at least two of his subordinates . These included former CIA officers E. Howard Hunt and James McCord , then-CREEP Security Coordinator ( John Mitchell had by then resigned as Attorney General to become chairman of the CREEP ) .

In common English , they are known as the crow family , or , more technically , corvids . Over 120 species are described . The genus Corvus , including the jackdaws , crows , and ravens , makes up over a third of the entire family .   They are considered the most intelligent of the birds , and among the most intelligent of all animals , having demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests ( European magpies ) and tool-making ability ( crows , rooks ) —skills until recently regarded as solely the province of humans and a few other higher mammals . Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to that of great apes and cetaceans , and only slightly lower than in humans .   They are medium to large in size , with strong feet and bills , rictal bristles , and a single moult each year ( most passerines moult twice ) . Corvids are found worldwide except for the tip of South America and the polar ice caps . The majority of the species are found in tropical South and Central America , southern Asia and Eurasia , with fewer than 10 species each in Africa and Australasia . The genus Corvus has re-entered Australia in relatively recent geological prehistory , with five species and one subspecies there .   Systematics , taxonomy , and evolution   Over the years , much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives . What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world . Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse , but often Australasian groups . In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s , Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida , based on DNA-DNA hybridization . The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs , birds of paradise , whipbirds , quail-thrushes , whistlers , monarch flycatchers and drongos , shrikes , vireos , and vangas , but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial . The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea , together with their closest relatives ( the birds of paradise , Australian mud-nesters and shrikes ) . They are also the core group of the Corvida , which includes the related groups , such as orioles and vireos .   Clarification of the interrelationships of the corvids has been achieved based on cladistic analysis of several DNA sequences . The jays and magpies do not constitute monophyletic lineages , but rather seem to split up into an American and Old World lineage , and an Holarctic and Oriental lineage , respectively . These are not closely related among each other . The position of the azure-winged magpie , which has always been a major enigma , is even less clear than before .

Among his novels and biographies , Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story , Ben-Hur : A Tale of the Christ ( 1880 ) , a bestselling novel that has been called `` the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century . ''   Wallace 's military career included service in the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War . He was appointed Indiana 's adjutant general and commanded the 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment . Wallace , who attained the rank of major general , participated in the Battle of Fort Donelson , the Battle of Shiloh , and the Battle of Monocacy . He also served on the military commission for the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators , and presided over the trial of Henry Wirz , the Confederate commandant of the Andersonville prison camp .   Wallace resigned from the U.S. Army in November 1865 and briefly served as a major general in the Mexican army , before returning to the United States . Wallace was appointed governor of the New Mexico Territory ( 1878–81 ) and served as U.S. minister to the Ottoman Empire ( 1881–85 ) . Wallace retired to his home in Crawfordsville , Indiana , where he continued to write until his death in 1905 .   Early life and education   Lewis `` Lew '' Wallace was born on April 10 , 1827 , in Brookville , Indiana . He was the second of four sons born to Esther French Wallace ( née Test ) and David Wallace.McKee , The Early Life of Lew Wallace , p. 206 . Lew 's father , a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy in West Point , New York , left the military in 1822 and moved to Brookville , where he established a law practice and entered Indiana politics . David served in the Indiana General Assembly and later as the state 's lieutenant governor , and governor , and as a member of Congress . Lew Wallace 's maternal grandfather was circuit court judge and Congressman John Test .   In 1832 the family moved to Covington , Indiana , where Lew 's mother died from tuberculosis on July 14 , 1834 . In December 1836 , David married nineteen-year-old Zerelda Gray Sanders Wallace , who later became a prominent suffragist and temperance advocate . In 1837 , after David 's election as governor of Indiana , the family moved to Indianapolis . Morrow , p. 3 .   Lew began his formal education at the age of six at a public school in Covington , but he much preferred the outdoors . Wallace had a talent for drawing and loved to read , but he was a discipline problem at school . In 1836 , at the age of nine , Lew joined his older brother in Crawfordsville , Indiana , where he briefly attended Wabash Preparatory School , but soon transferred to another school more suitable for his age . In 1840 , when Wallace was thirteen , his father sent him to a private academy at Centerville , Indiana , where his teacher encouraged Lew 's natural affinity for writing . Wallace returned to Indianapolis the following year.Gronert , p. 71 .   Sixteen-year-old Lew went out to earn his own wages in 1842 , after his father refused to pay for more schooling . Wallace found a job copying records at the Marion County clerk 's office and lived in an Indianapolis boardinghouse . He also joined the Marion Rifles , a local militia unit , and began writing his first novel , The Fair God , but it was not published until 1873 . Wallace acknowledged in his autobiography that he had never been a member of any organized religion , but he did believe `` in the Christian conception of God '' .   By 1846 , at the start of the Mexican–American War , the nineteen-year-old Wallace was studying law at his father 's law office , but left that pursuit to establish a recruiting office for the Marion Volunteers in Indianapolis . He was appointed a second lieutenant , and on June 19 , 1846 , mustered into military service with the Marion Volunteers ( also known as Company H , 1st Indiana Volunteer Infantry ) . Wallace rose to the position of regimental adjutant and the rank of first lieutenant while serving in the army of Zachary Taylor"], [31, "Rhinitis or coryza is irritation and inflammation of the mucous membrane inside the nose . Common symptoms are a stuffy nose , runny nose , sneezing , and post-nasal drip .   In rhinitis , the inflammation of the mucous membrane is caused by viruses , bacteria , irritants or allergens . The most common kind of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis , which is usually triggered by airborne allergens such as pollen and dander . Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms , such as sneezing and nasal itching , coughing , headache , fatigue , malaise , and cognitive impairment . The allergens may also affect the eyes , causing watery , reddened , or itchy eyes and puffiness around the eyes . The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of mucus , commonly producing a runny nose , as well as a stuffy nose and post-nasal drip . In the case of allergic rhinitis , the inflammation is caused by the degranulation of mast cells in the nose . When mast cells degranulate , they release histamine and other chemicals , starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose , such as fatigue and malaise . In the case of infectious rhinitis , it may occasionally lead to pneumonia , either viral pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia . Sneezing also occurs in infectious rhinitis to expel bacteria and viruses from the respiratory system .   Rhinitis is very common . Allergic rhinitis is more common in some countries than others ; in the United States , about 10 % –30 % of adults are affected annually .   Types   Rhinitis is categorized into three types ( although infectious rhinitis is typically regarded as a separate clinical entity due to its transient nature ) : ( i ) infectious rhinitis includes acute and chronic bacterial infections ; ( ii ) nonallergic ( vasomotor ) rhinitis includes idiopathic , hormonal , atrophic , occupational , and gustatory rhinitis , as well as rhinitis medicamentosa ( drug-induced ) ; ( iii ) allergic rhinitis , triggered by pollen , mold , animal dander , dust , Balsam of Peru , and other inhaled allergens .   Infectious   Rhinitis is commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection , including the common cold , which is caused by Rhinoviruses , Coronaviruses , and influenza viruses , others caused by adenoviruses , human parainfluenza viruses , human respiratory syncytial virus , enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses , metapneumovirus , and measles virus , or bacterial sinusitis , which is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and Moraxella catarrhalis . Symptoms of the common cold include rhinorrhea , sneezing , sore throat ( pharyngitis ) , cough , congestion , and slight headache .   Nonallergic rhinitis   Nonallergic rhinitis refers to rhinitis that is not due to an allergy . It was formerly known as vasomotor rhinitis as the cause was thought to be vasodilation caused by an overactive parasympathetic nerve response . It is now encompassed under the more general classification of nonallergic rhinitis . The diagnosis is made upon excluding allergic causes . It is an umbrella term of rhinitis of multiple causes , such as occupational ( chemical ) , smoking , gustatory , hormonal , senile ( rhinitis of the elderly ) , atrophic , medication-induced ( including rhinitis medicamentosa ) , local allergic rhinitis , non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome ( NARES ) and idiopathic ( vasomotor or non-allergic , non-infectious perennial allergic rhinitis ( NANIPER ) , or non-infectious non-allergic rhinitis ( NINAR ) .   In vasomotor rhinitis , certain nonspecific stimuli , including changes in environment ( temperature , humidity , barometric pressure , or weather ) , airborne irritants ( odors , fumes ) , dietary factors ( spicy food , alcohol ) , sexual arousal , exercise , and emotional factors trigger rhinitis . There is still much to be learned about this , but it is thought that these non-allergic triggers cause dilation of the blood vessels in the lining of the nose , which results in swelling and drainage .   Non-allergic rhinitis can co-exist with allergic rhinitis , and is referred to as `` mixed rhinitis . '' The pathology of vasomotor rhinitis appears to involve neurogenic inflammation and is as yet not very well understood . Vasomotor rhinitis appears to be significantly more common in women than men , leading some researchers to believe that hormones play a role . In general , age of onset occurs after 20 years of age , in contrast to allergic rhinitis which can be developed at any age .

Most international journeys to or from Iceland pass through this airport .   The main carriers at Keflavík are Icelandair and WOW air , each of which has the airport as its main hub . The airport is almost exclusively used for international flights ; most domestic flights use Reykjavík Airport , which lies 3 km from Reykjavík 's city centre , although seasonal flights from Akureyri fly to Keflavík . Keflavík Airport is operated by Isavia , a government enterprise .   History   Early years   Originally , the airport was built by the United States military during World War II and opened on March 23 , 1943 . The U.S. named it Meeks Field after a young pilot , George Meeks , who died on the Reykjavík airfield . After the war , the airport and the base were returned to Iceland 's control and were renamed for the nearby town of Keflavik . In 1951 , the U.S. military returned to the airport under a defense agreement between Iceland and the U.S. Later , Iceland joined NATO .   Development since the 1950s   With the reestablishment of the military air base at Keflavík during the 1950s , the air terminal found itself in the middle of a secure military zone . Travelers had to pass through military check points to reach their flights , until 1987 , when the civilian terminal was relocated ...   The presence of foreign military forces in Iceland under the NATO sponsored Iceland–U.S . Defense Agreement of 1951 was controversial in Iceland , which had no indigenous military forces other than the Icelandic Coast Guard . During the 1960s and 1970s , rallies were held to protest the U.S. military presence in Iceland ( and in particular at Keflavík ) , and every year protesters walked the 50 km road from Reykjavík to Keflavík and chanted `` Ísland úr NATO , herinn burt '' ( literally : Iceland out of NATO , the military away ) . The protests were not effective . One of the participants was Vigdís Finnbogadóttir , who later became the first female President of Iceland .   The former Agreed Military Area at Keflavík was re-designated `` Airport , Security and Development Area '' under the supervision of the Keflavík International Airport Ltd. ( established 1 January 2009 ) , the Icelandic Coast Guard and the Keflavík Airport Development Corporation ( Kadeco ) , respectively . The Coast Guard maintains hangars for military aircraft as well as ammunition depots , air defence radars and other military equipment for national defence . The former military encampment area ( U.S . Naval Air Station Keflavik ) being developed by Kadeco has been named Ásbrú to reflect its new role . The airport is in the little village named Sandgerði , but the runway leads to Keflavík .   The 10000 ft and 200 ft runways are long enough to support NASA 's Space Shuttle and also the Antonov An-225 . On 29 June 1999 , Concorde G-BOAA flew from Heathrow Airport to Reykjavík ( Keflavík airport ) . The Concorde had been there .   Facilities   The Airport is named after Leifur Eiríksson who was the first European to discover North America . Air Terminal ( ) , named for Leif Ericson . It was opened 6 April 1987 and separated the airport 's civil traffic from the military base . It was later extended with the opening of the South Building in 2001 ( not a separate terminal ) to comply with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement . The North Building was later enlarged and finished in 2007 . The terminal has duty-free stores in the departure and arrival lounges .   In 2016 , the current terminal was expanded .  The expansion added 7 gates . There are also plans to add a third runway .   Airlines and destinations   Although the population of Iceland is only about 300,000 , there are scheduled flights to and from numerous locations across North America and Europe . The largest carrier operating out of Keflavík is Icelandair . On 23 October 2012 WOW air acquired Iceland Express making it the second largest Icelandic carrier and the second largest at Keflavík . The airport only handles international flights"], [33, "In-N-Out Burger is a regional chain of fast food restaurants with locations primarily in the American Southwest and Pacific coast . Founded in Baldwin Park , California , in 1948 by Harry Snyder and his wife Esther Snyder . The chain is currently headquartered in Irvine , California and has slowly expanded outside Southern California into the rest of California , as well as into Arizona , Nevada , Utah , Texas , and Oregon . The current owner is Lynsi Snyder , the Snyders ' only grandchild .   As the chain has expanded , it has opened several distribution centers in addition to its original Baldwin Park location . The new facilities , located in Lathrop , California ; Phoenix , Arizona ; Draper , Utah ; and Dallas , Texas will provide for potential future expansion into other parts of the country .   In-N-Out Burger has resisted franchising its operations or going public ; one reason is the prospect of quality or customer consistency being compromised by excessively rapid business growth . The company 's business practices have been noted for employee-centered personnel policies . For example , In-N-Out is one of the few fast food chains in the United States to pay its employees more than state and federally mandated minimum wage guidelines – starting at US $ 9.25 per hour in California , as of August 2001 . The In-N-Out restaurant chain has developed a highly loyal customer base , and has been rated as one of the top fast food restaurants in several customer satisfaction surveys .   History   First generation   In-N-Out 's first location was opened in the Los Angeles suburb of Baldwin Park , California in 1948 by the Snyders at the southwest corner of what is now the intersection of Interstate 10 and Francisquito Avenue . The restaurant was the first drive-thru hamburger stand in California , allowing drivers to place orders via a two-way speaker system . This was a new and unique idea , since in post-World War II California , carhops were used to take orders and serve food . According to the company 's website , the Snyders had a simple plan that is still in use today : `` Give customers the freshest , highest quality foods you can buy and provide them with friendly service in a sparkling clean environment . ''   A second In-N-Out was opened west of the intersection of Grand Avenue and Arrow Highway in Covina , California , three years later . The company remained a relatively small southern California chain until the 1970s . The Snyders managed their first restaurants closely to ensure quality was maintained . The chain had 18 restaurants when Harry Snyder died in 1976 , at the age of 63 .   Second generation   In 1976 , 24-year-old Rich Snyder became the company president after his father 's death . Along with his brother Guy , Rich had reportedly begun working in his father 's In-N-Outs `` from the ground floor '' at an early age . Over the next 20 years , the chain experienced a period of rapid growth under Rich 's leadership , expanding to 93 restaurants .   The first location outside of the Los Angeles metropolitan area was opened in San Diego County in 1990 , the 61st location in the chain . In 1992 , In-N-Out opened its first non-Southern California restaurant in Las Vegas , Nevada . Its first Northern California location was opened the following year in Modesto . Expansion then spread to Northern California , including the San Francisco Bay Area , while additional Las Vegas-area restaurants were added . However , after opening the 83rd In-N-Out restaurant in Fresno , California , on December 15 , 1993 , Rich Snyder and four other passengers died in a plane crash on approach to John Wayne Airport in Orange County , California . The charter aircraft they were on had been following a Boeing 757 in for landing , became caught in its wake turbulence , and crashed . The ensuing crash investigation led to the Federal Aviation Administration requirement for an adequate distance between heavy aircraft and following light aircraft to allow wake turbulence to diminish .   Upon Rich Snyder 's death in 1993 , Guy Snyder assumed the presidency and continued the company 's aggressive expansion until he died from an overdose of painkillers in 1999 . He was president for six years , expanding In-N-Out from 83 to 140 locations . His mother Esther subsequently took over the presidency .   The 21st century   The company opened locations in Arizona in 2000 and added new restaurants"], [34, "The Roaring Twenties is a term for society and culture in the 1920s in the Western world . It was a period of sustained economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States , Canada and Western Europe , particularly in major cities such as New York , Montreal , Chicago , Detroit , Paris , Berlin , London and Los Angeles . In France and Quebec , it was known as the `` années folles '' ( `` Crazy Years '' ) , emphasizing the era 's social , artistic and cultural dynamism . Normalcy returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism after World War I , jazz music blossomed , the flapper redefined modern womanhood and Art Deco peaked . The era saw the large-scale use of automobiles , telephones , motion pictures , radio , electricity , refrigeration , air conditioning ; commercial , passenger , and freight aviation ; unprecedented industrial growth , accelerated consumer demand and aspirations , plus significant changes in lifestyle and culture . The media focused on celebrities , especially sports heroes and movie stars , as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums . In most major countries women won the right to vote .   The Wall Street Crash of 1929 ended the era , as the Great Depression set in bringing years of worldwide gloom and hardship .  The social and cultural features known as the Roaring Twenties began in leading metropolitan centers , especially Chicago , New Orleans , Los Angeles , New York City , Philadelphia , Paris , Berlin and London ; then spread widely in the aftermath of World War I . Thus , when Germany could no longer afford war reparations to Britain , France and other Allies , the Americans came up with the Dawes Plan and Wall Street invested heavily in Germany , which repaid its reparations to nations that in turn used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington . By the middle of the decade prosperity was widespread , with the second half of the decade especially in Germany known as the `` Golden Twenties '' .   The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity and a break with traditions . Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology . New technologies , especially automobiles , moving pictures and radio proliferated `` modernity '' to a large part of the population . Formal decorative frills were shed in favor of practicality in both daily life and architecture . At the same time , jazz and dancing rose in popularity , in opposition to the mood of the specter of World War I . As such , the period is also often referred to as the Jazz Age .   Economy   The Roaring Twenties was a decade of great economic growth and widespread prosperity driven by recovery from wartime devastation and postponed spending , a boom in construction , and the rapid growth of consumer goods such as automobiles and electricity . The economy of the United States , which had successfully transitioned from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy , boomed and provided loans for a European boom as well . However , some sectors were stagnant , especially farming and mining . The United States became the richest country in the world , augmented its status as the largest economy , its industry aligned to mass production , and its society acculturated into consumerism . European economies had a more difficult readjustment and began to flourish about 1924 .   At the end of World War I , soldiers returned to the United States and Canada with wartime wages and many new products on the market on which to spend . At first , the recession of wartime production caused a brief but deep recession , known as the post–World War I recession . Quickly , however , the U.S. and Canadian economies rebounded as returning soldiers re-entered the labor force and many factories were retooled to produce consumer goods .   Economic policies   The 1920s were a decade of increased consumer spending and economic pen growth fed by supply side economic policy . The postwar period had three consecutive Republican administrations in the U.S . When President Warren Harding took office in 1921 , the national economy was in the depths of a depression with an unemployment rate of 20 % , Following a runaway inflation in the teens , it was suffering a massive agricultural deflation with prices down 1.55 % in 1920 and over 11 % in 1921 ."], [35, "A prime minister is the most senior minister of cabinet in the executive branch of government , often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system . In many systems , the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet , and allocates posts to members within the government . In most systems , the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet . In a minority of systems , notably in semi-presidential systems of government , a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state .   In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system , the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of government and head of the executive branch . In such systems , the head of state or the head of state 's official representative ( i.e . the monarch , president , or governor-general ) usually holds a largely ceremonial position , although often with reserve powers .   The prime minister is often , but not always , a member of parliament and is expected with other ministers to ensure the passage of bills through the legislature . In some monarchies the monarch may also exercise executive powers ( known as the royal prerogative ) that are constitutionally vested in the crown and may be exercised without the approval of parliament .   As well as being head of government , a prime minister may have other roles or titles—the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , for example , is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service . Prime ministers may take other ministerial posts—for example , during the Second World War , Winston Churchill was also Minister of Defence ( although there was then no Ministry of Defence ) , and in the current cabinet of Israel , Benjamin Netanyahu also serves as Minister of Communications , Foreign Affairs , Regional Cooperation , Economy and Interior   Etymology   The first actual usage of the term prime minister or Premier Ministre was used by Cardinal Richelieu when in 1625 he was named to head the royal council as prime minister of France . Louis XIV and his descendants generally attempted to avoid giving this title to their chief ministers .   The term prime minister in the sense that we know it originated in the 18th century in the United Kingdom when members of parliament disparagingly used the title in reference to Sir Robert Walpole . Over time , the title became honorific and remains so in the 21st century .   History   Origins   The monarchs of England and the United Kingdom had ministers in whom they placed special trust and who were regarded as the head of the government . Examples were Thomas Cromwell under Henry VIII ; William Cecil , Lord Burghley under Elizabeth I ; Clarendon under Charles II and Godolphin under Queen Anne . These ministers held a variety of formal posts , but were commonly known as `` the minister '' , the `` chief minister '' , the `` first minister '' and finally the `` prime minister '' .   The power of these ministers depended entirely on the personal favour of the monarch . Although managing the parliament was among the necessary skills of holding high office , they did not depend on a parliamentary majority for their power . Although there was a cabinet , it was appointed entirely by the monarch , and the monarch usually presided over its meetings .   When the monarch grew tired of a first minister , he or she could be dismissed , or worse : Cromwell was executed and Clarendon driven into exile when they lost favour . Kings sometimes divided power equally between two or more ministers to prevent one minister from becoming too powerful . Late in Anne 's reign , for example , the Tory ministers Harley and St John shared power .   Development   In the mid 17th century , after the English Civil War ( 1642–1651 ) , Parliament strengthened its position relative to the monarch then gained more power through the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 . The monarch could no longer establish any law or impose any tax without its permission and thus the House of Commons became a part of the government . It is at this point that a modern style of prime minister begins to emerge .   A tipping point in the evolution of the prime ministership came with the death of Anne in"], [36, 'Tenerife South Airport ( ) , previously known as Tenerife South-Reina Sofia Airport , is the larger of the two international airports located on the island of Tenerife ( the other being Tenerife North Airport ) and the second busiest in the Canary Islands . It is located in the municipality of Granadilla de Abona and handled over 9 million passengers in 2014 .   History   In the late 1960s , the island authorities of Tenerife Identified the need for a new airport at a new location as the existing airport did not meet technical requirements due to adverse weather conditions .   The new airport was inaugurated on 6 November 1978 , by Queen Sofía of Spain , to whom the airport is dedicated . The first flight was Iberia flight IB187 from Lanzarote , which was operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 landing at 10:17 . By the end of its first year , 1 million passengers had passed through its doors .   The airport was under construction when the Tenerife airport disaster occurred at Tenerife North Airport in March 1977 .   Terminal   Tenerife South consists of one three-storey passenger terminal in a classic brick style . The main level , Floor 0 , contains all check-in and service counters , the departures waiting areas as well as the arrivals and main baggage reclaim . The departures area features 34 boarding gates of which eight are equipped with jetbridges .

The country geographically comprises two main landmasses – that of the North Island , or Te Ika-a-Māui , and the South Island , or Te Waipounamu – and numerous smaller islands . New Zealand is situated some 1500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1000 km south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal , fungal and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , while its most populous city is Auckland .   Sometime between 1250 and 1300 CE , Polynesians settled in the islands that would later become New Zealand , and developed a distinctive Māori culture . In 1642 , Abel Tasman , a Dutch explorer , became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the British Crown and Māori Chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , making New Zealand a British colony . Today , the majority of New Zealand 's population of 4.7 million is of European descent ; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority , followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders . Reflecting this , New Zealand 's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers , with recent broadening arising from increased immigration . The official languages are English , Māori and New Zealand Sign Language , with English predominant .   New Zealand is a developed country with a market economy . New Zealand is a World Bank high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance , such as health , education , economic freedom and quality of life . Nationally , legislative authority is vested in an elected , unicameral Parliament , while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet , led by the Prime Minister , who is currently John Key . Queen Elizabeth II is the country 's head of state and is represented by a Governor-General . In addition , New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes . The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau ( a dependent territory ) ; the Cook Islands and Niue ( self-governing states in free association with New Zealand ) ; and the Ross Dependency , which is New Zealand 's territorial claim in Antarctica . New Zealand is a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , Pacific Islands Forum , and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation .   Etymology   Dutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and called it Staten Landt , supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America . In 1645 , Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland . British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand .   Aotearoa ( often translated as `` land of the long white cloud '' ) is the current Māori name for New Zealand . It is unknown whether Māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans , with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island . Māori had several traditional names for the two main islands , including Te Ika-a-Māui ( the fish of Māui ) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu ( the waters of greenstone ) or Te Waka o Aoraki ( the canoe of Aoraki ) for the South Island . Early European maps labelled the islands North ( North Island ) , Middle ( South Island ) and South ( Stewart Island / Rakiura ) . In 1830 , maps began to use North and South to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 , this was the accepted norm . The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised , and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013 . This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui , and South Island or Te Waipounamu . Note that for each island , either its English or Māori name can be used , or both can be used together .   History"], [38, "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 , although related conflicts began earlier . It involved the vast majority of the world 's nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . It was the most widespread war in history , and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries . In a state of `` total war '' , the major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources . Marked by mass deaths of civilians , including the Holocaust ( in which approximately 11 million people were killed ) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres ( in which approximately one million were killed , and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) , it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities . These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history .   The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937 , but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth , with campaigns including the North Africa and East Africa campaigns , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz bombing campaign , the Balkan Campaign as well as the long-running Battle of the Atlantic . In June 1941 , the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union , opening the largest land theatre of war in history , which trapped the major part of the Axis ' military forces into a war of attrition . In December 1941 , Japan attacked the United States and European territories in the Pacific Ocean , and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific .   The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway , near Hawaii , and Germany was defeated in North Africa and then , decisively , at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union . In 1943 , with a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front , the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of Italy which brought about Italian surrender , and Allied victories in the Pacific , the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts . In 1944 , the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France , while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies . During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma , while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands .   The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union , culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945 . Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms , the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively . With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent , the possibility of additional atomic bombings , and the Soviet Union 's declaration of war on Japan and invasion of Manchuria , Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945 . Thus ended the war in Asia , cementing the total victory of the Allies .   World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world . The United Nations ( UN ) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts . The victorious great powers—the United States , the Soviet Union , China , the United Kingdom , and France—became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council ."], [39, "Alberta is a western province of Canada . With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1 , 2015 , it is Canada 's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada 's three prairie provinces . Its area is about . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1 , 1905 . The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015 .   Alberta is bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east , the Northwest Territories to the north , and the U.S. state of Montana to the south . Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than to areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming .   Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , oil sands ( Athabasca oil sands ) and other northern resource industries .   About 290 km south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta . Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta 's two census metropolitan areas , both of which have populations exceeding one million , while the province has 16 census agglomerations . Tourist destinations in the province include Banff , Canmore , Drumheller , Jasper and Sylvan Lake .   Etymology   Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta ( 1848–1939 ) , the fourth daughter of Victoria , Queen of Canada , and Albert , Prince Consort . Princess Louise was the wife of John Campbell , Marquess of Lorne , Governor General of Canada ( 1878–83 ) . Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour .   Geography   Alberta , with an area of 661848 km2 , is the fourth largest province after Quebec , Ontario , and British Columbia . To the south , the province borders on the 49th parallel north , separating it from the US state of Montana , while on the north the 60th parallel north divides it from the Northwest Territories . To the east , the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan , while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains , and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N .   The province extends 1223 km north to south and 660 km east to west at its maximum width . Its highest point is 3747 m at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border , while its lowest point is 152 m on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast .   With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the southeastern section , the province has adequate water resources . There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming , fishing and a range of water sports . There are three large lakes , Lake Claire ( 1436 km2 ) in Wood Buffalo National Park , Lesser Slave Lake ( 1168 km2 ) , and Lake Athabasca ( 7898 km2 ) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan . The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels 1538 km from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca . The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3/s . The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River , a tributary of the Mackenzie River .   Alberta 's capital city , Edmonton , is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province . It is the most northerly major city in Canada , and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada . The region , with its proximity to Canada 's largest oil fields , has most of western Canada 's oil refinery capacity . Calgary is located approximately 280 km south of Edmonton and 240 km north of Montana , surrounded by extensive ranching country .

Cash ; February 26 , 1932 – September 12 , 2003 ) was an American singer-songwriter , guitarist , actor , and author , who was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time , having sold more than 90 million records worldwide . Although primarily remembered as a country music icon , his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll , rockabilly , blues , folk , and gospel . This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music , Rock and Roll , and Gospel Music Halls of Fame .   Cash was known for his deep , calm bass-baritone voice , the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band , a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor , free prison concerts , and a trademark look , which earned him the nickname `` The Man in Black '' . He traditionally began his concerts with the simple `` Hello , I 'm Johnny Cash '' , followed by his signature `` Folsom Prison Blues '' .   Much of Cash 's music echoed themes of sorrow , moral tribulation and redemption , especially in the later stages of his career . His best-known songs included `` I Walk the Line '' , `` Folsom Prison Blues '' , `` Ring of Fire '' , `` Get Rhythm '' and `` Man in Black '' . He also recorded humorous numbers like `` One Piece at a Time '' and `` A Boy Named Sue '' ; a duet with his future wife , June Carter , called `` Jackson '' ( followed by many further duets after their marriage ) ; and railroad songs including `` Hey , Porter '' , `` Orange Blossom Special '' and `` Rock Island Line '' . During the last stage of his career , Cash covered songs by several late 20th century rock artists , most notably `` Hurt '' by Nine Inch Nails .   Early life and influences   Cash was born on February 26 , 1932 , in Kingsland , Arkansas , one of seven children born to Ray Cash ( May 13 , 1897 , Kingsland , Arkansas – December 23 , 1985 , Hendersonville , Tennessee ) and Carrie Cloveree ( née Rivers ; March 13 , 1904 , Rison , Arkansas – March 11 , 1991 , Hendersonville , Tennessee ) .  He was mostly of Scottish and English ancestry , and as an adult traced his surname to 11th-century Fife , Scotland , after meeting with the then-laird of Falkland , Fife , Major Michael Crichton-Stuart . Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the name of his family .   At birth , Cash was named J. R. Cash . When Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force , he was not permitted to use initials as a first name , so he changed his name to John R. Cash . In 1955 , when signing with Sun Records , he took Johnny Cash as his stage name .   The Cash children were : Roy , Margaret Louise , Jack , J. R. , Reba , Joanne , and Tommy . Tommy Cash also became a successful country artist . In March 1935 , when Cash was three years old , the family settled in Dyess , Arkansas . He started working in cotton fields at age five , singing along with his family while working . The family farm was flooded on at least two occasions , which later inspired him to write the song `` Five Feet High and Rising '' . His family 's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs , especially those about other people facing similar difficulties .   Cash was very close to his older brother , Jack . In May 1944 , Jack was pulled into a whirling head saw in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two . He suffered for over a week before he died on May 20 , 1944 , at age 15 . Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident . According to Cash : The Autobiography , his father was away that morning , but he and his mother , and Jack himself , all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day , causing his mother to urge Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother . Jack insisted on working ,"], [41, "The Hillsborough disaster was a human crush at Hillsborough football stadium in Sheffield , England , on 15 April 1989 ; with 96 dead and 766 injured it is the worst disaster in British sporting history . It remains one of the world 's worst football disasters . It happened during the 1988–89 FA Cup semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest , being played at the neutral venue of Hillsborough , home ground of Sheffield Wednesday . The disaster resulted in a number of safety improvements in the largest football grounds , notably the elimination of standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadia , and the removal of spectator fencing , introduced to prevent pitch invasions . Initial investigations attached most of the blame to the police , but the coroner 's inquest ruled the deaths as accidental and no prosecutions followed . Aggrieved relatives launched a campaign for truth and justice , initially rebuffed , but eventually succeeding in gaining a new inquest verdict in 2016 , exonerating fans of any blame and recording a verdict of unlawful killing .   The crush occurred in the two central pens in the Leppings Lane stand , allocated to Liverpool fans ; in an attempt to ease overcrowding outside the entrance turnstiles shortly before kick-off , the police match commander chief superintendent David Duckenfield had ordered an exit gate to be opened , leading to a sudden influx of around 2,000 supporters through a tunnel leading to the central pens , trapping spectators already in the pens , with fences to their front and sides . With the kick-off due at 3 pm , the gate was opened 2:52 pm ; by 3:06 pm the game had been stopped .   Many of the myths about the disaster emerged in the following days , as police fed false stories to the press , resulting in the headline `` The Truth '' in the national tabloid newspaper The Sun . These persisted even after the Taylor Report of 1990 , which found the main reason for the disaster was a failure of control by South Yorkshire Police ( SYP ) , and that fans ' behaviour played no part in it . Despite Taylor criticising the police 's attempts to shift blame , the Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution against individuals or institutions . Families strongly rejected the coroner 's subsequent ruling , disagreeing with his decision not to examine events after 3.15 pm . New evidence claimed by controversial TV documentary Hillsborough in 1996 failed to convince authorities , with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concluding in 1997 there was no justification for a new inquiry . Private prosecutions against Duckenfield and his deputy Bernard Murray failed in 2000 .   A turning point came in 2009 when government minister Andy Burnham was heckled during the 20th anniversary memorial ; it led to the formation of the Hillsborough Independent Panel to review all evidence . Reporting in 2012 , it confirmed Taylor 's criticisms , while also revealing new details around the extent of the police efforts to shift blame , the role of other emergency services , and the error of the coroner 's 3.15 pm cut off point . Two criminal investigations were then launched by police in 2012 , Operation Resolve to look into the causes , and an Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) to examine actions by police in the aftermath . The original inquest verdict was also quashed in 2012 , and a second one ran from 1 April 2014 to 26 April 2016 , the longest jury case in British history . It returned a verdict that the supporters were unlawfully killed due to grossly negligent failures by police and ambulance services to fulfil their duty of care to the supporters . The inquest also found that the design of the stadium contributed to the crush , and that supporters were not to blame for the dangerous conditions . For the actions of his force during the second inquest , the SYP chief constable David Crompton was suspended . Two days after the verdict , a private prosecution was brought on behalf of hundreds of relatives against both SYP and the West Midlands Police force ( who took statements from the SYP ) , alleging a concerted cover-up designed to shift blame away from the police .   Before the disaster   The venue   Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield , the home of Sheffield Wednesday , was selected by the Football Association ( FA ) as a neutral venue to host the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs .

Biography   Douglas was born in Florence , Italy , the eldest son of Scottish Conservative Party politician Archibald , Viscount Drumlanrig and Caroline Margaret Clayton . He was briefly styled Viscount Drumlanrig following his father 's succession in 1856 , and on his father 's death in 1858 he inherited the Marquessate of Queensberry . The 9th Marquess was educated in the training ships Illustrious and Britannia at Portsmouth , and served in the Royal Navy until resigning in 1864 . He was Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 1st Dumfriesshire Rifle Volunteers from 1869 to 1871 .   In 1864 he entered Magdalene College , Cambridge , which he left two years later without taking a degree . He was more distinguished in sport , playing college cricket as well as running , hunting and steeplechasing . Article by John Davis .   He married Sibyl Montgomery in 1866 . They had four sons and a daughter ; his wife successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his adultery . She survived him to the age of 90 , dying in 1935 . The daughter , who became Lady Edith Gertrude Douglas , married the inventor St. George Lane Fox-Pitt . Queensberry married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year .   He died , two months after a stroke , and after a period of mental decline believed to be caused by syphilis , in his club room in Welbeck Street , west London , aged 55 , nearly a year before Oscar Wilde 's death . He wrote a poem starting with the words `` When I am dead cremate me . '' After cremation at Woking Crematorium his ashes were buried in Scotland in the family burial ground at Kinmount , Dumfriesshire .   In a surprising turn of events , for a man famed for his atheism and secularism , he apparently confessed his love for Christ and was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed , at his own request .   His eldest son and heir apparent was Francis , Viscount Drumlanrig , who was rumoured to have been engaged in a homosexual relationship with the Liberal Prime Minister , Archibald Primrose , 5th Earl of Rosebery . He died unmarried and without issue .   Douglas ' second son , Lord Percy Douglas ( 1868–1920 ) , succeeded to the peerage instead . Lord Alfred `` Bosie '' Douglas , the third son , was the close friend and lover of the famous author and poet Oscar Wilde . Queensberry 's efforts to end that relationship led to his famous dispute with Wilde .   Contributions to sports   Queensberry was a patron of sport and a noted boxing enthusiast . In 1866 he was one of the founders of the Amateur Athletic Club , now the Amateur Athletic Association of England , one of the first groups that did not require amateur athletes to belong to the upper-classes in order to compete . The following year the Club published a set of twelve rules for conducting boxing matches . The rules had been drawn up by John Graham Chambers but appeared under Queensberry 's sponsorship and are universally known as the `` Marquess of Queensberry rules '' .   A keen rider , Queensberry was also active in fox hunting and owned several successful race horses . As a rider his first winner was in the Dumfriesshire Hunt Club chase in 1865 , and his last was at Sandown Park in 1883 . He was Master of the Worcester Fox Hounds in 1870 . He was on the committee of the National Hunt but never won a Grand National as a rider , a last-minute substitution on the victorious `` Old Joe '' keeping him out of the 1886 National . During his riding career he recovered from a series of serious injuries .   Political career   In 1872 , Queensberry was chosen by the Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords as a representative peer . He served as such until 1880 , when he was again nominated but refused to take the religious oath of allegiance to the Sovereign . Viewed by some as an outspoken atheist , he declared that he would not participate in"], [43, "Kelly Jones ( born 3 June 1974 ) is a Welsh singer-songwriter , guitarist and director and the lead singer of the band Stereophonics . Influenced by classic rock bands such as Pink Floyd , The Who , Led Zeppelin , AC/DC and Sex Pistols , Jones is noted for his raspy voice , which has been described as `` whiskey '' and has drawn criticism as well as acclaim . As a lyricist , Jones is influenced by Neil Young , Bob Catley , Steve Perry , Bob Dylan and Otis Redding .   History   Early life and début   Jones lived in the village of Cwmaman , near Aberdare , where he became friends with neighbours , Stuart Cable and Richard Jones and they formed a covers band together . Showing a talent for writing in his youth , he considered being a scriptwriter before being a musician and studied film at college . The BBC showed an interest in some of his early work but , as the band progressed from a cover band to writing their original material , he decided to use his narrative side more towards writing lyrics . Jones also flirted with the idea of boxing as a career and was a successful boxer at youth level . Much of his early life is documented in Stereophonics ' debut album , including his account of his teen years on a market stall . These are documented in `` More Life in a Tramps Vest '' from Stereophonics ' first album released in 1997 , Word Gets Around .   In 1999 Stereophonics were the first band to be signed to Richard Branson 's new Virgin Records label V2 . Their debut EP Looks Like Chaplin did not have enough copies made to enter the charts and their next single Local Boy in the Photograph was one place shy of making the UK Top 50 . However , their debut LP Word Gets Around did , however , make it to number 6 on the UK Albums Chart . Fellow Welsh band Manic Street Preachers put the band as support on their 1996-97 tour .   1998 - present : Mainstream success   In February 1998 , they received a Brit Award for Best New Group , the same week as a re-issue of Local Boy in the Photograph made number 14 in the charts and their first album went gold in the UK , selling over 100,000 copies . During that year Stereophonics had tours in Europe , Australia and the USA . They performed a concert on 12 June 1998 at Cardiff Castle . They performed a cover of the Randy Newman song Mama Told Me Not to Come with Tom Jones for his album Reload .   After another tour , they re-entered the studios and recorded Just Enough Education to Perform , containing the single Mr . Writer and Have a Nice Day , and Step on My Old Size Nines . A cover of Rod Stewart 's version of Mike D'Abo 's song Handbags & Gladrags was added to later editions of the album . They also recorded their biggest audience to date when they played to 80,000 in Slane Castle in Ireland and ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium , Cardiff , supported by Feeder and Ocean Colour Scene - who they had supported years before .   They released their fourth studio album You Got ta Go There to Come Back with songs like Maybe Tomorrow and Madame Helga and a re-worked song that had not been completed in time - Moviestar . They re-issued the album with this track included .   In 2002 , the band was chosen as a support act for Counting Crows and toured on various UK dates with the band . Subsequently Jones would join the band on stage and perform Mr. Jones and Hanginaround alongside Adam Duritz .   In 2003 , whilst on tour in Germany , drummer Stuart Cable - whom by this time had his own television chat show on BBC Wales - was sacked from the band by Jones , citing problems over `` commitment '' . Cable was replaced temporarily on the remainder of the tour by Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman . According to Stuart , `` I kept pluggin ' away . I knew when we started we were n't very good and I was waiting for it to get better . It was becoming obvious that was n't going to happen and I said so . Kelly did n't like that '' .

This battle put an end to the first French invasion of Portugal .   Four days after the Battle of Roliça , Wellesley 's army was attacked by a French army under General Junot near the village of Vimeiro . The battle began as a battle of manoeuvre , with French troops attempting to outflank the British left , but Wellesley was able to redeploy his army to face the assault . Meanwhile , Junot sent in two central columns but these were forced back by sustained volleys from troops in line . Soon afterwards , the flanking attack was beaten off and Junot retreated towards Torres Vedras having lost 2,000 men and 13 cannon , compared to 700 Anglo-Portuguese losses . No pursuit was attempted because Wellesley was superseded by Sir Harry Burrard and then Sir Hew Dalrymple ( one having arrived during the battle , the second soon after ) .   Prelude   After Roliça , Wellesley had established a position near Vimeiro . By holding the village , plus some ridges to the west , the British commander covered a beachhead at Maceira Bay a little further to the west . Since most of his reinforcements had arrived by 20 August , Wellesley planned to advance south on Lisbon . Eight independent infantry brigades under Rowland Hill , Ronald Fergusson , Miles Nightingall , Barnard Bowes , Catlin Craufurd , Henry Fane , Robert Anstruther and Wroth Acland formed the core of Wellesley 's forces . Rounding out his force were 17 cannons , 240 light cavalry led by C. D. Taylor and about 2,000 Portuguese troops under Nicholas Trant , giving a total of 20,000 men .   Junot organised his 14,000-man force into two infantry divisions and a cavalry division under Pierre Margaron . Henri François Delaborde 's infantry division contained two brigades under Antoine François Brenier and Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières , while Louis Henri Loison 's division included two brigades commanded by Jean-Baptiste Solignac and Hugues Charlot . In addition , François Étienne de Kellermann commanded a 2,100-man reserve made up of four converged grenadier battalions . These units were created by taking the grenadier company from each of Junot 's infantry battalions . The French took 23 cannons into battle with them .   Wellesley placed Anstruther 's and Fane 's brigades in front of Vimeiro , with Acland 's men in support . At first , his five remaining brigades held only the western ridge . Junot planned to send Thomieres , Solignac and Charlot 's infantry brigades to capture Vimeiro , while Brenier 's 4,300-man brigade and some dragoons swung in a wide flanking manoeuvre to seize an empty ridge to the northeast of the village . Wellesley detected Brenier 's move and switched Nightingall , Fergusson and Bowes to the northeastern ridge . Once Junot realised that British troops occupied the ridge , he sent Solignac 's brigade to the right to assist Brenier 's attack . The French commander decided to launch his attack on the town immediately , instead of waiting for his flanking move to develop .   Battle   All the preliminary moves and countermoves caused a series of uncoordinated French attacks . First , Thomieres ' 2,100-man brigade approached the British position . Supported by three cannons and screened by skirmishers , the brigade was formed into a column of companies .   The first company of 120 men formed in a three-deep line would have a front rank 40 men wide . All the other companies formed behind the first company , making the entire brigade about 40 files wide and 48 ranks deep . According to French doctrine , as soon as the enemy main position was found , the companies would peel off to the right or left to form a firing line many companies wide and only three files deep . On the other hand , French commanders often pressed home attacks while in column , depending entirely upon their skirmishers and artillery to provide the necessary fire support .   To counter the French skirmishers , Fane detached four companies of riflemen ( 60th Regiment of Foot & 95th Rifles ) . These outnumbered and outfought the French skirmishers , who fell back to the sides of the brigade column . Without their skirmishers in front of them , the French column blundered into the 945 men of the 50th Regiment ."], [45, "The Who are an English rock band that formed in 1964 . Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey , guitarist Pete Townshend , bass guitarist John Entwistle , and drummer Keith Moon . They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century , selling over 100 million records worldwide and holding a reputation for their live shows and studio work .   The Who developed from an earlier group , the Detours , and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements , featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage . Their first single as the Who , `` I Ca n't Explain '' , reached the UK top ten , followed by a string of singles including `` My Generation '' , `` Substitute '' and `` Happy Jack '' . In 1967 , they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single `` I Can See for Miles '' , while touring extensively . The group 's fourth album , 1969 's rock opera Tommy , included the single `` Pinball Wizard '' and was a critical and commercial success . Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival , along with the live album Live at Leeds , cemented their reputation as a respected rock act . With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter and visionary Townshend , and the follow-up to Tommy , Lifehouse , was abandoned . Songs from the project made up 1971 's Who 's Next , which included the hit `` Wo n't Get Fooled Again '' . The group released the album Quadrophenia in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots , and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy in 1975 . They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976 . The release of Who Are You in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after .   Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed activity , releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright . After Townshend became weary of touring , the group split in 1982 . The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985 , a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996–97 . They resumed regular touring in 1999 , with drummer Zak Starkey . After Entwistle 's death in 2002 , plans for a new album were delayed . Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who , releasing Endless Wire in 2006 , and continued to play live regularly .   The Who 's major contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack , large PA systems , use of the synthesizer , Entwistle and Moon 's lead playing styles , Townshend 's feedback and power chord guitar technique , and the development of the rock opera . They are cited as an influence by hard rock , punk rock and mod bands , and their songs still receive regular exposure .   History   Background   The founding members of the Who , Roger Daltrey , Pete Townshend and John Entwistle , grew up in Acton , London and went to Acton County Grammar School . Townshend 's father , Cliff , played saxophone and his mother , Betty , had sung in the entertainment division of the Royal Air Force during World War II , and both supported their son 's interest in rock and roll . Townshend and Entwistle became friends in their second year of Acton County , and formed a trad jazz group ; Entwistle also played French horn in the Middlesex Schools ' Symphony Orchestra . Both were interested in rock , and Townshend particularly admired Cliff Richard 's début single , `` Move It '' . Entwistle moved to guitar , but struggled with it due to his large fingers , and moved to bass on hearing the guitar work of Duane Eddy . He was unable to afford a bass and built one at home . After Acton County , Townshend attended Ealing Art College , a move he later described as profoundly influential on the course of the Who .   Daltrey , who was in the year above , had moved to Acton from Shepherd 's Bush , a more working-class area . He had trouble fitting in at the school , and discovered gangs and rock and roll . He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site . In 1959 he started the Detours , the band that was"], [46, "The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin is a series of novels that developed into a British sitcom starring Leonard Rossiter in the title role . Both the books and television series were written by David Nobbs , and the screenplay for the first series was adapted by Nobbs from the novel , though subplots in the novel were considered too dark or risqué for television and toned down or omitted , an example being the relationship between Perrin 's daughter and his brother-in-law .   The story concerns a middle-aged middle manager , Reginald `` Reggie '' Perrin , who is driven to bizarre behaviour by the pointlessness of his job at Sunshine Desserts . The sitcom proved to be a subversion of others of the era , which were often based on bland middle-class suburban family life .   The first novel in the series , The Death of Reginald Perrin , was published in 1975 , with later editions retitled to match the title of the television series . Subsequent novels ( The Return of Reginald Perrin [ 1977 ] and The Better World of Reginald Perrin [ 1978 ] ) were written by Nobbs with the express goal of being adapted into the second and third television series , respectively ; Rossiter did not want to take the series forward unless it continued to be grounded in novels .   The original three television series , all of the same name , were broadcast between 1976 and 1979 ; a fourth , The Legacy of Reginald Perrin , also written by Nobbs , followed in 1996 .   Series summaries   Series One ( 8 September – 20 October 1976 )   The first series was based on Nobbs 's novel The Death of Reginald Perrin , retitled The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin to tie in with the television series . It still retains the replacement title .   Reginald Iolanthe Perrin is suffering a mid-life crisis , and tries to escape his dreary life . He lives at 12 Coleridge Close , part of the `` Poets Estate '' in a south London suburb called Climthorpe , a development different from those around it only by having the streets named after famous poets . He commutes to Sunshine Desserts where he works as a sales executive . Each morning he is 11 minutes late ( this increased to 17 then 22 minutes with subsequent series ) yet each morning he gives a different excuse . These become increasingly bizarre ( `` defective junction box , New Malden '' being one of the more plausible ones ; `` escaped puma at Chessington North '' being one of the least ) reflecting the decline of both British Rail and his own mental health . He enters the office building under the `` Sunshine Desserts '' sign which , as the series progresses , loses more and more letters .   `` Reggie '' , as he is known , daydreams in Walter Mitty style . Part of the narrative demonstrates what voices in his head are saying . Although he appears to love his wife , he fantasises about his secretary , Joan Greengross . As his behaviour becomes more erratic , he is unable to dictate letters without uttering words like `` breast '' . Far from being offended , Joan welcomes the attention , adjusting her posture to show her figure .   The endless marketing campaigns for bizarre products , satirised in reports from the product research department , combine with Reggie 's relations with his oppressive boss `` CJ '' and his yes-man subordinates to drive him over the edge . Ceasing to care about the consequences , he dictates offensive and condescending replies to customers .   At home things are no better . Despite his warm relationship with his wife Elizabeth he suffers from impotence . As pressures at work build , relations with his dysfunctional relatives deteriorate , especially with his incompetent brother-in-law Jimmy and son-in-law Tom , a man whose `` political correctness '' emphasises his pomposity . After a few reckless acts , including getting out of his car in the lion enclosure at a safari park , Reggie fakes his suicide by leaving clothes and personal effects on a beach . Before this he sends CJ an anonymous threat containing the words `` blood will flow '' , dumping loganberry essence into a stream while CJ is angling . CJ collapses and the company doctor , Doc Morrisey , pronounces him dead . CJ opens one eye and says , `` You 're fired !

St Blaise is the civil parish in which St Blazey is situated ; the name St Blaise is also used by the town council . The village of Biscovey and the settlements of St Blazey Gate , Bodelva and West Par lie within the parish boundaries . An electoral ward also exists in the name of St Blaise . The population at the 2011 census was 4,674 .  Once an important engineering centre for the local mine and railway industries , the parish is now dominated by the Eden Project .   St Blazey is situated 3 mi east of St Austell , 1 mi west of Tywardreath and 1 mi north of Par .   The town takes its name from the Armenian Saint Blaise and holds a procession and service on his feast day , 3 February .   History   An Iron Age hillfort Prideaux Castle lies a mile to the north west of the town in the parish of Luxulyan .   The Biscovey Stone is the shaft of an ancient Celtic cross . It was inscribed , but the text is no longer readable . There are several theories about the stone ; one says it dates from around 600 AD to show the Saxon advance into the county , another puts the date at around 900 AD . The head is thought to have been removed during the Reformation . The stone served as a gate post near the St Blazey turnpike gate . In 1896 it was moved to St Mary 's Church , Biscovey .   The church was built between 1440 and 1445 and is dedicated to Saint Blaise . It replaces an earlier church mentioned in 1294 . The parish was administered by Tywardreath Priory until the Reformation . It was split from St Austell parish in 1834 .  The site was originally known by the Cornish names Landrait or Landreath , meaning Church on the Sand .   Until the 16th century the valley below St Blazey was an estuary of the River Par and the St Blazey was the lowest crossing point on the river . Tin mining up river caused the estuary to silt up and it had become marsh land by the early 19th century . The Par Canal was built by Joseph Treffry between 1829 and 1835 ; it forms part of the boundary with the parish of Tywardreath and Par .   The town was once dominated by the local mining industries and their associated transport infrastructure . Historically copper and tin were mined in and around the parish , whilst more recently china clay has been the principal commodity mined . `` The Par & St Blazey Consols '' or `` South Prideaux Wood '' was a small tin mine just north of the town and Par Consols Mine lies to the south west . The more extensive Fowey Consols mine lies to the east near Tywardreath .   The port of Par Harbour , which lies within the parish , was developed to ease the transport of these minerals , and initially connected to the mines by the Par Canal . Whilst the port of Par is within the parish , the village of Par is actually just across the River Par , and hence lies in the civil parish of Tywardreath .   The Par Canal was soon replaced by the Cornwall Minerals Railway , which had a depot and station in the town , and still exists as part of the Atlantic Coast Line . Whilst St Blazey depot is still in use , St Blazey station closed to passengers in 1925 , and the town is now served by Par station on the Cornish Main Line in Par village .   Tourism   The Eden Project is located within the civil parish , and about a mile and half ( 2 km ) from the centre of the town . The large number of visitors this attracts has led to the development of tourism in the town . Other attractions , such as the Treffry Viaduct and the Luxulyan Valley , are also close by , although actually within the adjoining parish of Luxulyan .

More broadly , `` the sea '' is the interconnected system of Earth 's salty , oceanic waters—considered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions . The sea moderates Earth 's climate and has important roles in the water cycle , carbon cycle , and nitrogen cycle . Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory , the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s . The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including the IHO 's four named oceans ( the Atlantic , Pacific , Indian , and Arctic ) and the Southern Ocean ; smaller , second-order sections , such as the Mediterranean , are known as seas .   Owing to the present state of continental drift , the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea ( a ratio of about 2:3 ) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic ( 1:4.7 ) .Reddy , M.P.M . ( 2001 ) [ https : //books.google.com/books ? id  2NC3JmKI7mYC & lpg=PA112 Descriptive Physical Oceanography ] . p. 112 . A.A. Balkema , Leiden . ISBN 90-5410-706-5 . Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5 % by mass , although this can vary in more landlocked waters , near the mouths of large rivers , or at great depths . About 85 % of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride . Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature . Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides , the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun . The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth ( the Coriolis effect ) .   Former changes in the sea levels have left continental shelves , shallow areas in the sea close to land . These nutrient-rich waters teem with life , which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish , but also shellfish , mammals , and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed . The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs . Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales ' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting . Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters : even under enormous depths and pressures , nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem . Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth 's atmosphere ; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea .   The sea is an essential aspect of human trade , travel , mineral extraction , and power generation . This has also made it essential to warfare and left major cities exposed to earthquakes and volcanoes from nearby faults ; powerful tsunami waves ; and hurricanes , typhoons , and cyclones produced in the tropics . This importance and duality has affected human culture , from early sea gods to the epic poetry of Homer to the changes induced by the Columbian Exchange , from Viking funerals to Basho 's haikus to hyperrealist marine art , and inspiring music ranging from the shanties in The Complaynt of Scotland to Rimsky-Korsakov 's `` The Sea and Sinbad 's Ship '' to A-mei 's `` Listen to the Sea '' . It is the scene of leisure activities including swimming , diving , surfing , and sailing . However , population growth , industrialization , and intensive farming have all contributed to present-day marine pollution . Atmospheric carbon dioxide is being absorbed in increasing amounts , lowering its pH in a process known as ocean acidification . The shared nature of the sea has made overfishing an increasing problem .   Definition   Both senses of sea date to Old English ; the larger sense has required a definite article since Early Middle English . As the term has been applied over time , there are no sharp distinctions between seas and oceans , although seas are smaller and are—with the notable exception of the Sargasso Sea created by the North Atlantic Gyre—usually bounded by land on a smaller scale than multiple continents . Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water , but the Sea of Galilee is a freshwater lake . There is no accepted technical"], [49, "Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia . Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . To the east and southeast , Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas , and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europe—a concept dating back to classical antiquity—are arbitrary ; the primarily physiographic term `` continent '' as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent 's current boundaries .   Europe is the world 's second-smallest continent by surface area , covering about or 2 % of the Earth 's surface and about 6.8 % of its land area . Of Europe 's approximately 50 countries , Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39 % of the continent and comprising 15 % of its population , while Vatican City is the smallest both in terms of area and population . Europe is the third-most populous continent after Asia and Africa , with a population of 739–743 million or about 11 % of the world 's population . Europe has a climate heavily affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the Atlantic , seasonal differences are mildly greater than close to the coast .   Europe , in particular ancient Greece , is the birthplace of Western civilization . The fall of the Western Roman Empire , during the migration period , marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the `` Middle Ages '' . The Renaissance humanism , exploration , art , and science led the `` old continent '' , and eventually the rest of the world , to the modern era . From this period onwards , Europe played a predominant role in global affairs . Between the 16th and 20th centuries , European nations controlled at various times the Americas , most of Africa , Oceania , and the majority of Asia .   The Industrial Revolution , which began in the United Kingdom at the end of the 18th century , gave rise to radical economic , cultural , and social change in Western Europe , and eventually the wider world . Both world wars were largely focused upon Europe , contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the United States and Soviet Union took prominence . During the Cold War , Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east , until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the Berlin Wall .   European integration led to the formation of the European Union , a political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation . The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The currency of most countries of the European Union , the Euro , is the most commonly used among Europeans and the EU 's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states .   Definition   Clickable map of Europe , showing one of the most commonly used continental boundaries Key : blue : states which straddle the border between Europe and Asia ;  green : states not geographically in Europe , but closely associated with the continent   The use of the term `` Europe '' has developed gradually throughout history . In antiquity , the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts , Europe , Asia , and Libya ( Africa ) , with the Nile and the River Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don , rather than the Phasis , as the boundary between Europe and Asia . Europe 's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don . The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons ; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar , separating it from North Africa , to the Don , separating it from Asia .

It is the world 's second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue , after Comcast . Disney was founded on October 16 , 1923 , by Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio , and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production , television , and theme parks . The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio , then Walt Disney Productions . Taking on its current name in 1986 , it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater , radio , music , publishing , and online media .   In addition , Disney has since created corporate divisions in order to market more mature content than is typically associated with its flagship family-oriented brands . The company is best known for the products of its film studio , Walt Disney Studios , which is today one of the largest and best-known studios in American cinema . Disney 's other three main divisions are Walt Disney Parks and Resorts , Disney Media Networks , and Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media . Disney also owns and operates the ABC broadcast television network ; cable television networks such as Disney Channel , ESPN , A+E Networks , and Freeform ; publishing , merchandising , music , and theatre divisions ; and owns and licenses 14 theme parks around the world . The company has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since May 6 , 1991 . Mickey Mouse , an early and well-known cartoon creation of the company , is a primary symbol and mascot for Disney .   Corporate history   1923–28 : The silent era   In early 1923 , Kansas City , Missouri , animator Walt Disney created a short film entitled Alice 's Wonderland , which featured child actress Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters . After the bankruptcy in 1923 of his previous firm , Laugh-O-Gram Studios , Disney moved to Hollywood to join his brother , Roy O. Disney . Film distributor Margaret J. Winkler of M.J. Winkler Productions contacted Disney with plans to distribute a whole series of Alice Comedies purchased for $ 1,500 per reel with Disney as a production partner . Walt and Roy Disney formed Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio that same year . More animated films followed after Alice . In January 1926 , with the completion of the Disney studio on Hyperion Street , the Disney Brothers Studio 's name was changed to the Walt Disney Studio .   After the demise of the Alice comedies , Disney developed an all-cartoon series starring his first original character , Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , which was distributed by Winkler Pictures through Universal Pictures . The distributor owned Oswald , so Disney only made a few hundred dollars . Disney completed 26 Oswald shorts before losing the contract in February 1928 , due to a legal loophole , when Winkler 's husband Charles Mintz took over their distribution company . After failing to take over the Disney Studio , Mintz hired away four of Disney 's primary animators ( the exception being Ub Iwerks ) to start his own animation studio , Snappy Comedies .   1928–34 : Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies   In 1928 , to recover from the loss of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , Disney came up with the idea of a mouse character named Mortimer while on a train headed to California , drawing up a few simple drawings . The mouse was later renamed Mickey Mouse ( Disney 's wife , Lillian , disliked the sound of 'Mortimer Mouse ' ) and starred in several Disney produced films . Ub Iwerks refined Disney 's initial design of Mickey Mouse . Disney 's first sound film Steamboat Willie , a cartoon starring Mickey , was released on November 18 , 1928 through Pat Powers ' distribution company . It was the first Mickey Mouse sound cartoon released , but the third to be created , behind Plane Crazy and The Gallopin ' Gaucho . Steamboat Willie was an immediate smash hit , and its initial success was attributed not just to Mickey 's appeal as a character , but to the fact that it was the first cartoon to feature synchronized sound . Disney used Pat Powers ' Cinephone system , created by Powers using Lee De Forest 's Phonofilm system . Steamboat Willie premiered at B. S. Moss 's Colony Theater in"], [52, "A television licence or broadcast receiving licence is an official record of payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts , or the possession of a television set where some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fee paid . The licence is sometimes also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts . A TV licence is therefore effectively a hypothecated tax for the purpose of funding public broadcasting , thus allowing public broadcasters to transmit television programmes without , or with only supplemental , funding from radio and television advertisements . However , in some cases the balance between public funding and advertisements is the opposite - the Polish TVP broadcaster receives more funds from advertisements than from its TV tax .   Whilst TV licensing is rare in the Americas , half of the countries in Asia , a few countries in Africa , and two-thirds of the countries in Europe use television licences to fund public television .   History   The early days of broadcasting presented broadcasters with the problem of how to raise funding for their services . Some countries adopted the advertising model , but many others adopted a compulsory public subscription model , with the subscription coming in the form of a broadcast licence paid by households owning a radio set ( and later , a TV set ) .   The UK was the first country to adopt the compulsory public subscription model with the licence fee money going to the BBC , which was formed on 1 January 1927 by Royal Charter to produce publicly funded programming yet remain independent from government , both managerially and financially . The licence was originally known as a wireless licence .   With the arrival of television some countries created a separate additional television licence , while others simply increased the radio licence fee to cover the additional cost of TV broadcasting , changing the licence 's name from `` radio licence '' to `` TV licence '' or `` receiver licence '' . Today most countries fund public radio broadcasting from the same licence fee that is used for television , although a few still have separate radio licences , or apply a lower or no fee at all for consumers who only have a radio . Some countries also have different fees for users with colour or monochrome TV . Many give discounts , or charge no fee , for elderly and/or disabled consumers .   Faced with the problem of licence fee evasion , some countries choose to fund public broadcasters directly from taxation or via other less avoidable methods such as a co-payment with electricity billing . National public broadcasters in some countries also carry supplemental advertising .   The Council of Europe created the European Convention on Transfrontier Television in 1989 that regulates among other things  advertising standards , time and the format of breaks , which also has an indirect effect on the usage of licensing . In 1993 , this treaty entered into force when it achieved 7 ratifications including 5 member states . It has since been acceded to by 34 countries , .   Television licences around the world   The Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago notes that two-thirds of the countries in Europe and half of the countries in Asia and Africa use television licences to fund public television . TV licensing is rare in the Americas , largely being confined to French overseas departments and British Overseas Territories .   In some countries , radio channels and broadcasters ' web sites are also funded by a radio receiver licence , giving access to radio and web services free of commercial advertising .   The actual cost and implementation of the television licence varies greatly from country to country . The rest of this section looks at the licence fee in a number of countries around the world .   Europe   Albania   The Albanian licence fee is 800 lekë ( €5.81 ) per year . However , the licence fee makes up only a small part of public broadcaster RTSh 's funding . RTSh is mainly funded directly from the government through taxes ( 58 % ) , the remaining 42 % comes from commercials and the licence fee .   Austria   In accordance with the Austria RGG ( TV and Radio Licence Law ) all broadcasting reception equipment in use or operational at a given location must be registered . The location of the equipment is taken to be places of residence or any other premises with a uniform purpose of use ."], [53, "Nuristan , also spelled Nurestan or Nooristan , ( Nuristani/Pashto : نورستان ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan , located in the eastern part of the country . It is divided into seven districts and has a population of about 140,900 . Parun serves as the provincial capital .   It was formerly known as Kafiristan ( , `` land of the infidels '' ) until the inhabitants were converted to Islam in 1895 , and thence the region has become known as Nuristan ( `` land of light '' ) .   The primary occupations are agriculture , animal husbandry , and day labor . Located on the southern slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains in the northeastern part of the country , Nuristan spans the basins of the Alingar , Pech , Landai Sin , and Kunar rivers . Nuristan is bordered on the south by Laghman and Kunar provinces , on the north by Badakhshan province , on the west by Panjshir province , and on the east by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan .   History   Early history   The surrounding area fell to Alexander the Great in 330 B.C . It later fell to Chandragupta Maurya . The Mauryas introduced Hinduism and Buddhism to the region , and were attempting to expand their empire to Central Asia until they faced local Greco-Bactrian forces . Seleucus is said to have reached a peace treaty with Chandragupta by giving control of the territory south of the Hindu Kush to the Mauryas upon intermarriage and 500 elephants .   Having consolidated power in the northwest , Chandragupta pushed east towards the Nanda Empire . Afghanistan 's significant ancient tangible and intangible Buddhist heritage is recorded through wide-ranging archeological finds , including religious and artistic remnants . Buddhist doctrines are reported to have reached as far as Balkh even during the life of the Buddha ( 563 BCE to 483 BCE ) , as recorded by Xuanzang .   The region was historically known as Kafiristan ( meaning `` Land of the kafirs '' ) because of its inhabitants : the Nuristani , an ethnically distinctive people who practiced a form of ancient Hinduism . It was conquered by Emir Abdur Rahman Khan in the late 19th century and the Nuristani people began converting to Islam .   British missionaries wrote :   The region was renamed Nuristan , meaning Land of the enlightened , a reflection of the `` enlightening '' of the pagan Nuristani by the `` light-giving '' of Islam .   Nuristan was once thought to have been a region through which Alexander the Great passed with a detachment of his army ; thus the folk legend that the Nuristani people are descendants of Alexander ( or `` his generals '' ) .   Abdul Wakil Khan Nuristani is one of the most prominent figures in Nuristan 's history . He fought against the British-led Punjabi army and drove them out of the eastern provinces of Afghanistan . He is buried on the same plateau where King Amanullah Khan is buried .   Recent history   Since the creation of Pakistan in 1947 , Afghan politicians ( particularly Mohammed Daoud Khan ) have been focusing on re-annexing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of what is now Pakistan . This has led to militancy on both sides of the Durand Line . In the meantime , Pakistani politicians have been focusing on connecting what is now Tajikistan with Pakistan . This requires weakening Afghan rule in Nuristan and Badakhshan provinces by secretly funding anti-Afghan rebel forces .   Nuristan was the scene of some of the heaviest guerrilla fightings during the 1980s Soviet war in Afghanistan . The province was influenced by Mawlawi Afzal 's Islamic Revolutionary State of Afghanistan , which was supported by Pakistan nationalists and Saudi Arabia . It dissolved under the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ( Taliban rule ) in the late 1990s .   Nuristan is one of the poorest and most remote provinces of Afghanistan . Few NGO 's operate in Nuristan because of Taliban insurgency and lack of safe roads . The United States and the Afghan government are jointly working to solve these issues . Some road construction projects were launched linking Nangarej to Mandol and Chapa Dara to Titan Dara . The Afghan government also worked on a direct road route to Laghman province , in order to reduce dependence on the road through restive Kunar province to the rest of Afghanistan . Other road projects were started aimed at improving the primitive road from Kamdesh to Barg-i Matal , and from Nangalam in Kunar province"], [54, "Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire . It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture . The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror . Since the time of Henry I , it has been used by all monarchs , and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe . The castle 's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as `` a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste '' . Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George 's Chapel , considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be `` one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic '' design .   Originally designed to protect Norman dominance around the outskirts of London and oversee a strategically important part of the River Thames , Windsor Castle was built as a motte-and-bailey , with three wards surrounding a central mound . Gradually replaced with stone fortifications , the castle withstood a prolonged siege during the First Barons ' War at the start of the 13th century . Henry III built a luxurious royal palace within the castle during the middle of the century , and Edward III went further , rebuilding the palace to make an even grander set of buildings in what would become `` the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England '' . Edward 's core design lasted through the Tudor period , during which Henry VIII and Elizabeth I made increasing use of the castle as a royal court and centre for diplomatic entertainment .   Windsor Castle survived the tumultuous period of the English Civil War , when it was used as a military headquarters for Parliamentary forces and a prison for Charles I . At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the help of the architect Hugh May , creating a set of extravagant Baroque interiors that are still admired . After a period of neglect during the 18th century , George III and George IV renovated and rebuilt Charles II 's palace at colossal expense , producing the current design of the State Apartments , full of Rococo , Gothic and Baroque furnishings . Queen Victoria made a few minor changes to the castle , which became the centre for royal entertainment for much of her reign . Windsor Castle was used as a refuge for the royal family during the Luftwaffe bombing campaigns of the Second World War and survived a fire in 1992 . It is a popular tourist attraction , a venue for hosting state visits , and the preferred weekend home of Elizabeth II . Today , more than 500 people live and work in Windsor Castle – the largest inhabited castle in the world .   Architecture   Windsor Castle occupies , and combines the features of a fortification , a palace , and a small town . The present-day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects , culminating in the reconstruction work after a fire in 1992 . It is in essence a Georgian and Victorian design based on a medieval structure , with Gothic features reinvented in a modern style . Since the 14th century , architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions , repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles . As a result , architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle 's architecture as having `` a certain fictive quality '' , the Picturesque and Gothic design generating `` a sense that a theatrical performance is being put on here '' , despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity . Although there has been some criticism , the castle 's architecture and history lends it a `` place amongst the greatest European palaces '' .   Middle Ward   At the heart of Windsor Castle is the Middle Ward , a bailey formed around the motte or artificial hill in the centre of the ward . The motte is 50 ft high and is made from chalk originally excavated from the surrounding ditch . The keep , called the Round Tower , on the top of the motte is based on an original 12th-century building , extended upwards in the early 19th century under architect Jeffry Wyatville by 30 ft ( 9 m ) to produce a more"], [55, "Arches National Park is a US National Park in eastern Utah . The park is located on the Colorado River 4 mi north of Moab , Utah . It is known for containing over 2,000 natural sandstone arches , including the world-famous Delicate Arch , in addition to a variety of unique geological resources and formations .   The park is located just outside Moab , Utah , and is in area . Its highest elevation is 5653 ft at Elephant Butte , and its lowest elevation is 4085 ft at the visitor center . Forty-three arches are known to have collapsed since 1977 . The park receives 10 in of rain a year on average .   Administered by the National Park Service , the area was originally named a National Monument on April 12 , 1929 . It was redesignated as a National Park on November 12 , 1971 .   Geology   The national park lies atop an underground evaporite layer or salt bed , which is the main cause of the formation of the arches , spires , balanced rocks , sandstone fins , and eroded monoliths in the area . This salt bed is thousands of feet thick in places , and was deposited in the Paradox Basin of the Colorado Plateau some 300 million years ago when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated . Over millions of years , the salt bed was covered with debris eroded from the Uncompahgre Uplift to the northeast . During the Early Jurassic ( about 210 Ma ) desert conditions prevailed in the region and the vast Navajo Sandstone was deposited . An additional sequence of stream laid and windblown sediments , the Entrada Sandstone ( about 140 Ma ) , was deposited on top of the Navajo . Over 5000 feet ( 1500 m ) of younger sediments were deposited and have been mostly eroded away . Remnants of the cover exist in the area including exposures of the Cretaceous Mancos Shale . The arches of the area are developed mostly within the Entrada formation.Kiver , Eugene P. and David V. Harris , Geology of U. S. Parklands , Wiley , 5th ed. , 1999 p.503-515 ISBN 0-471-33218-6   The weight of this cover caused the salt bed below it to liquefy and thrust up layers of rock into salt domes . The evaporites of the area formed more unusual salt anticlines or linear regions of uplift . Faulting occurred and whole sections of rock subsided into the areas between the domes . In some places , they turned almost on edge . The result of one such 2500 ft displacement , the Moab Fault , is seen from the visitor center .   As this subsurface movement of salt shaped the landscape , erosion removed the younger rock layers from the surface . Except for isolated remnants , the major formations visible in the park today are the salmon-colored Entrada Sandstone , in which most of the arches form , and the buff-colored Navajo Sandstone . These are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park . Over time , water seeped into the surface cracks , joints , and folds of these layers . Ice formed in the fissures , expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock , breaking off bits and pieces . Winds later cleaned out the loose particles . A series of free-standing fins remained . Wind and water attacked these fins until , in some , the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out . Many damaged fins collapsed . Others , with the right degree of hardness and balance , survived despite their missing sections . These became the famous arches .   Although the park 's terrain appears rugged and durable , it is the exact opposite . More than 700,000 visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem . The problem lies within the soil 's crust which is composed of cyanobacteria , algae , fungi , and lichens that grow in the dusty parts of the park . Factors that make Arches National Park sensitive to visitor damage include : semiarid region , and the scarce , unpredictable rainfall , lack of deep freezing , and lack of plant litter which results in soils that have both a low resistance to , and slow recovery from , compressional forces such as foot traffic . Methods of indicating effects on the soil are cytophobic soil crust index , measuring of water infiltration , and t-tests that are used to compare the values from the undisturbed and disturbed areas .

Martin came to public notice in the 1960s as a writer for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour , and later as a frequent guest on The Tonight Show . In the 1970s , Martin performed his offbeat , absurdist comedy routines before packed houses on national tours . Since the 1980s , having branched away from stand-up comedy , Martin has become a successful actor , as well as an author , playwright , pianist and banjo player , eventually earning him an Emmy , Grammy and American Comedy awards , among other honors .   In 2004 , Comedy Central ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics . He was awarded an Honorary Academy Award at the Academy 's 5th Annual Governors Awards in 2013 .   While he has played banjo since an early age , and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career , he has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s , acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo , recording , and touring with various bluegrass acts , including Earl Scruggs , with whom he won a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002 . He released his first solo music album , The Crow : New Songs for the 5-String Banjo , in 2009 , for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album .   Early life   Martin was born on August 14 , 1945 , in Waco , Texas , the son of Mary Lee ( née Stewart ; 1913–2002 ) and Glenn Vernon Martin ( 1914–1997 ) , a real estate salesman and aspiring actor . Martin was raised in Inglewood , California , and then later in Garden Grove , California , in a Baptist family . Martin was a cheerleader of Garden Grove High School . One of his earliest memories is of seeing his father , as an extra , serving drinks onstage at the Call Board Theatre on Melrose Place . During World War II , in England , Martin 's father had appeared in a production of Our Town with Raymond Massey . Expressing his affection through gifts of cars , bikes , etc. , Martin 's father was stern , and not emotionally open to his son . He was proud but critical , with Martin later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly ones of hatred . Martin 's first job was at Disneyland , selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during the school 's summer break . That lasted for three years ( 1955–58 ) . During his free time he frequented the Main Street Magic shop , where tricks were demonstrated to potential customers . By 1960 , he had mastered several of the tricks and illusions , and took a paying job at the Magic shop in Fantasyland in August . There he perfected his talents for magic , juggling , and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor Wally Boag , Martin ( 2007 ) p18–19 frequently performing for tips . In his authorized biography , close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could `` be described most accurately as an agnostic [ ... ] he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition '' .   Comedy   After high school graduation , Martin attended Santa Ana College , taking classes in drama and English poetry . In his free time , he teamed up with friend and Garden Grove High School classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre . He joined a comedy troupe at Knott 's Berry Farm . Later , he met budding actress Stormie Sherk , and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved . Sherk 's influence caused Martin to apply to the California State University , Long Beach , for enrollment with a major in Philosophy . Stormie enrolled at UCLA , about an hour 's drive north , and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives .   Inspired by his philosophy classes , Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor-comedian . His time at college changed his life . `` It changed what I believe and what I think about everything . I majored in philosophy . Something about non-sequiturs appealed to me . In philosophy , I started studying logic , and they were talking about cause"], [57, "The Queen Is Dead is the third studio album by the English rock band the Smiths . It was released on 16 June 1986 in the United Kingdom by Rough Trade Records and released in the United States on 23 June 1986 through Sire Records .   The album spent twenty two weeks on the UK Albums Chart , peaking at number two . Across the Atlantic , it reached number 28 in Canada on the RPM 100 album chart and number 70 on the Billboard 200 chart , and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1990 . It has sold consistently well ever since and has received unanimous critical acclaim , with NME listing it as the greatest album of all time in 2013 .   Songwriting   Guitarist Johnny Marr wrote several songs that would later appear on The Queen Is Dead while the Smiths toured Britain in early 1985 , working out song arrangements with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce during soundchecks . The title of the album is from the novel , `` Last Exit to Brooklyn '' by author Hubert Selby , Jr .. The title of the album could be a reference to the scene in Macbeth where Seyton informs the title character of his wife 's murder ( `` The queen , my Lord , is dead '' ) . The title could also refer to a scene in Cymbeline where Cornelius , the doctor , informs Cymbeline , the king , `` The queen is dead . ''   `` The Boy with the Thorn in His Side '' was , according to Marr , `` an effortless piece of music '' , and was written on tour in the spring of 1985 . The song 's lyrics refer allegorically to the band 's experience of the music industry that failed to appreciate it . In 2003 , Morrissey named this as his favourite Smiths song .   A demo of the music for `` Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others '' was posted by Marr through Morrissey 's letterbox in the summer of 1985 . Morrissey then completed the song by adding lyrics . Marr has stated that he `` preferred the music to the lyrics '' .   `` Frankly , Mr. Shankly '' , `` I Know It 's Over '' and `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out '' were written by Morrissey and Marr in a `` marathon '' writing session in the late summer of 1985 at Marr 's home in Bowdon , Greater Manchester . The first of these is reputed to have been addressed to Geoff Travis , head of the Smiths ' record label Rough Trade . Travis has since described it as `` a funny lyric '' about `` Morrissey 's desire to be somewhere else '' , acknowledging that a line in the song about `` bloody awful poetry '' was a reference to a poem he had written for Morrissey .   `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out '' features lyrics drawn from `` Lonely Planet Boy '' by the New York Dolls . According to Marr : `` When we first played it , I thought it was the best song I 'd ever heard '' . The guitar part of `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out ' draws on the Rolling Stones cover of Marvin Gaye 's `` Hitch Hike '' , a song that , itself , was an inspiration for the Velvet Underground 's `` There She Goes Again '' .   The music for `` Never Had No One Ever '' , completed in August 1985 , was based on a demo which Marr had recorded in December 1984 , itself based on `` I Need Somebody '' by the Stooges . According to Marr : `` The atmosphere of that track pretty much sums up the whole album and what it was like recording it . '' The lyric to the song reflects Morrissey 's feeling unsafe and , being from an immigrant family , not at home on the streets of Manchester .   `` The Boy with the Thorn in His Side '' , `` Bigmouth Strikes Again '' and `` Frankly , Mr. Shankly '' were debuted live during a tour of Scotland in September and October , during which `` The Queen Is Dead '' and `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out '' were soundchecked . `` The Queen is Dead '' was based on a song Marr began writing as a teenager . `` Cemetry Gates '' ( sic ) was a late addition to"], [58, "A nation state is a type of state that conjoins the political entity of a state to the cultural entity of a nation , from which it aims to derive its political legitimacy to rule and potentially its status as a sovereign state if one accepts the declarative theory of statehood as opposed to the constitutive theory.Such a definition is a working one : `` All attempts to develop terminological consensus around `` nation '' resulted in failure '' , concludes . Walker Connor , in [ ] discusses the impressions surrounding the characters of `` nation '' , `` ( sovereign ) state '' , `` nation state '' , and `` nationalism '' . Connor , who gave the term `` ethnonationalism '' wide currency , also discusses the tendency to confuse nation and state and the treatment of all states as if nation states . In Globalization and Belonging , Sheila L. Crouche discusses `` The Definitional Dilemma '' ( pp . 85ff ) .  A state is specifically a political and geopolitical entity , whilst a nation is a cultural and ethnic one . The term `` nation state '' implies that the two coincide , in that a state has chosen to adopt and endorse a specific cultural group as associated with it . `` Nation state '' formation can take place at different times in different parts of the world .   The concept of a nation state can be compared and contrasted with that of the multinational state , city state , empire , confederation , and other state formations with which it may overlap . The key distinction is the identification of a people with a polity in the `` nation state . ''   History and origins   The origins and early history of nation states are disputed . A major theoretical question is : `` Which came first , the nation or the nation state ? '' Scholars such as Steven Weber , David Woodward , and Jeremy Black have advanced the hypothesis that the nation state did n't arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source , nor was it an accident of history or political invention ; but is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in political economy , capitalism , mercantilism , political geography , and geography combined together with cartography and advances in map-making technologies . It was with these intellectual discoveries and technological advances that the nation state arose . For others , the nation existed first , then nationalist movements arose for sovereignty , and the nation state was created to meet that demand . Some `` modernization theories '' of nationalism see it as a product of government policies to unify and modernize an already existing state . Most theories see the nation state as a 19th-century European phenomenon , facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education , mass literacy and mass media . However , historians also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in Portugal and the Dutch Republic .   In France , Eric Hobsbawm argues , the French state preceded the formation of the French people . Hobsbawm considers that the state made the French nation , not French nationalism , which emerged at the end of the 19th century , the time of the Dreyfus Affair . At the time of the 1789 French Revolution , only half of the French people spoke some French , and 12-13 % spoke it `` fairly '' , according to Hobsbawm .   During the Italian unification , the number of people speaking the Italian language was even lower . The French state promoted the unification of various dialects and languages into the French language . The introduction of conscription and the Third Republic 's 1880s laws on public instruction , facilitated the creation of a national identity , under this theory .   Some nation states , such as Germany or Italy , came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by nationalists , during the 19th century . In both cases , the territory was previously divided among other states , some of them very small . The sense of common identity was at first a cultural movement , such as in the Völkisch movement in German-speaking states , which rapidly acquired a political significance . In these cases , the nationalist sentiment and the nationalist movement clearly precede the unification of the German and Italian nation states .   Historians Hans Kohn , Liah Greenfeld , Philip White and others have classified nations such as Germany or Italy , where cultural unification preceded state unification , as ethnic nations"], [59, "Boxing is a martial art and combat sport in which two people wearing protective gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring .   Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth sport and is a common fixture in most international games—it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee , is disqualified for breaking a rule , resigns by throwing in a towel , or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges ' scorecards at the end of the contest . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , the fight is considered a draw ( professional boxing ) . In Olympic boxing , due to the fact that a winner must be declared , in the case of a draw - the judges use technical criteria to choose the most deserving winner of the bout .   While people have fought in hand-to-hand combat since before the dawn of history , the origin of boxing as an organized sport may be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game in BC 688 . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century , again initially in Great Britain and later in the United States .   History   Ancient history   See also Ancient Greek boxing   The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a Sumerian relief in Iraq from the 3rd millennium BCE Later depictions from the 2nd millennium BC are found in reliefs from the Mesopotamian nations of Assyria and Babylonia , and in Hittite art from Asia Minor . The earliest evidence for fist fighting with any kind of gloves can be found on Minoan Crete ( c.1650–1400 BCE ) , and on Sardinia , if we consider the boxing statues of Prama mountains ( c. 2000–1000 BC ) .   Boxing was a popular spectator sport in Ancient Rome . In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped leather thongs around their fists . Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a weapon . The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestus which then led to a more sinister weapon called the myrmex ( 'limb piercer ' ) . Fighting events were held at Roman Amphitheatres . The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events . However , especially in later times , purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities , and their lives were not given up without due consideration . Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor . This is where the term ring came from . In AD 393 , during the Roman gladiator period , boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality . It was not until the late 17th century that boxing re-surfaced in London .   Early London prize ring rules   Records of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western Roman Empire when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned . However , there are detailed records of various fist-fighting sports that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries . There was also a sport in ancient Rus called Kulachniy Boy or `` Fist Fighting '' .   As the wearing of swords became less common , there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists . The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of bare-knuckle boxing sometimes referred to as prizefighting . The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the London Protestant Mercury , and the first English bare-knuckle champion was James Figg in 1719 . This is also the time when the word `` boxing '' first came to be used . It should be noted , that this earliest form of modern boxing was very different . Contests in Mr. Figg 's time , in addition to fist fighting , also contained fencing and cudgeling . On 6 January 1681 , the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when Christopher Monck , 2nd Duke of Albemarle ( and later Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica ) engineered a bout between his"], [60, "The Path is the tenth studio album by English acoustic roots duo Show of Hands , released in April 2003 . The album was conceived as an `` instrumental journey '' around the South West Coast Path , a 630-mile coastline path opened in 1978 in the duo 's native West Country , and a celebration of the coastline 's `` sights and sounds '' . It is the band 's only completely instrumental album , with each of its songs named after and inspired by different locations on the path . It was a project between Show Of Hands and The South West Coast Path Team , as part of the latter 's celebrations for the silver jubilee ( 25th anniversary ) of the path . As such the album is endorsed by various organisations who own different parts of the path , namely The Countryside Agency , The National Trust and English Heritage Commission , .and the music is ambient instrumentals inspired by different locations around the coastline .   The duo hoped that , with the album , listeners would be inspired to discover or rediscover the `` endless fascination '' of the coast path . The album was released on 14 April 2003 by the duo 's own label Hands on Music , a month before they released their following album Country Life . In July 2012 , music from The Path featured in several themed videos on a new interactive official website for the South West Coast Path , which attracts some 400,000 hits a year . One track from the album , `` Port Isaac '' , featured on their compilation album Roots : The Best of Show of Hands ( 2007 ) .   Background   Show of Hands entered the 2000s by recording an album of cover versions , Covers ( 2000 ) , which presented a stripped down sound with no overdubs or multitracking . They followed this their second concert at the Royal Albert Hall which was filmed for their VHS concert film The Big Gig ( 2001 ) , which itself was followed by their ninth studio album , Cold Frontier ( 2001 ) , which was co-produced between the duo and Mick Dolan , engineer for Steve Winwood . Critical praise greeted both releases , and the duo embarked on The Cold Frontier Tour in November 2001 , where they played a great deal of unreleased or `` rare '' material . The band 's live album Cold Cuts ( 2002 ) , which was drawn from material from the tour , was released to positive reviews . The duo began writing for what they planned to be their next album .   Meanwhile , The Countryside Agency were looking to celebrate the silver jubilee ( 25th anniversary ) of the South West Coast Path , a National Trail that remains the longest waymarked long-distance footpath ( and one of the longest in the UK ) . It stretches for 630 mi , running from Minehead in Somerset , along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall , to Poole Harbour in Dorset . It is also one of the more challenging trails as it rises and falls with every river mouth , and its total height climbed has been calculated to be 114,931 ft ( 35,031 m ) , almost four times the height of Mount Everest . It has been voted `` Britain 's Best Walking Route '' twice in a row by readers of the Ramblers Walk magazine , and regularly features in lists of the world 's best walks .   The South West Coast Path Association formed in 1973 , and after being constructed over five years , the path was opened in 1978 . To celebrate the silver jubilee of the association in 1998 , they set up a fund to raise money for markers at Minehead and South Haven Point , and erected `` Path Markers '' on the path at Minehead in 2001 and South Haven Point in 2002 . To celebrate the silver jubilee of the path 's opening , Show of Hands , who had began work on their tenth album Country Life , were asked by The South West Coast Path Association to create an album of music celebrating the path and the sites that it visits . Show of Hands are from Devon , the only English country to have two coastlines , and the South West Coast Path crosses both of them . As such , it became a local project for the duo . The duo changed their focus from Country Life to the album concerning the coast path 's silver jubilee . As different parts of the path are"], [61, "The Stockton and Darlington Railway ( S & DR ) was a railway company that operated in north-east England from 1825 to 1863 . The world 's first public railway to use steam locomotives , its first line connected collieries near Shildon with Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington , and was officially opened on 27 September 1825 . The movement of coal to ships rapidly became a lucrative business , and the line was soon extended to a new port and town at Middlesbrough . While coal waggons were hauled by steam locomotives from the start , passengers were carried in coaches drawn by horses until carriages hauled by steam locomotives were introduced in 1833 .   The S & DR was involved in the building of the East Coast Main Line between York and Darlington , but its main expansion was at Middlesbrough Docks and west into Weardale and east to Redcar . It suffered severe financial difficulties at the end of the 1840s and was nearly taken over by the York , Newcastle and Berwick Railway , before the discovery of iron ore in Cleveland and the subsequent increase in revenue meant it could pay its debts . At the beginning of the 1860 it took over railways that had crossed the Pennines to join the West Coast Main Line at and Clifton , near .   The company was taken over by the North Eastern Railway in 1863 , transferring 200 rtmi of line and about 160 locomotives , but continued to operate independently as the Darlington Section until 1876 . The opening of the S & DR was seen as proof of the effectiveness of steam railways and its anniversary was celebrated in 1875 , 1925 and 1975 . Much of the original route is now served by the Tees Valley Line , operated by Northern .   Genesis   Origins   Coal from the inland mines in County Durham was taken away on packhorses , and then horse and carts as the roads were improved . A canal was proposed by George Dixon in 1767 and again by John Rennie in 1815 , but both schemes failed . A few years later a canal was proposed on a route that bypassed Darlington and Yarm , and a meeting was held in Yarm to oppose the route . The Welsh engineer George Overton was consulted , and he advised building a tramroad . Overton carried out a survey and planned a route from the Etherley and Witton Collieries to Shildon , and then passing to the north of Darlington to reach Stockton . The Scottish engineer Robert Stevenson was said to favour the railway , and the Quaker Edward Pease supported it at a public meeting in Darlington on 13 November 1818 , promising a five per cent return on investment . Approximately two-thirds of the shares were sold locally , and the rest were bought by Quakers nationally . A private bill was presented to Parliament in March 1819 , but as the route passed through Earl of Eldon 's estate and one of the Earl of Darlington 's fox coverts , it was opposed and defeated by 13 votes .   Overton surveyed a new line that avoided Darlington 's estate and agreement was reached with Eldon , but another application was deferred early in 1820 , as the death of King George III had made it unlikely a bill would pass that parliamentary year . The promoters lodged a bill on 30 September 1820 , the route having changed again as agreement had not been reached with Viscount Barrington about the line passing over his land . The railway was unopposed this time , but the bill nearly failed to enter the committee stage as the required four-fifths of shares had not been sold . Pease subscribed £7,000 ; from that time he had considerable influence over the railway and it became known as `` the Quaker line '' . The Act that received royal assent on 19 April 1821 allowed for a railway that could be used by anyone with suitably built vehicles on payment of a toll , that was closed at night , and with which land owners within 5 mi could build branches and make junctions ; no mention was made of steam locomotives . This new railway initiated the construction of more railway lines , causing significant developments in railway mapping and cartography , iron and steel manufacturing , as well as in any industries requiring more efficient transportation .   George Stephenson   Concerned about Overton 's competence , Pease asked George Stephenson , an experienced enginewright of the collieries of Killingworth , to meet him in Darlington .

The picture was directed by John Guillermin .   A co-production between 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. ( this was the first film to be a joint venture by two major Hollywood studios ) , it was adapted by Stirling Silliphant from a pair of novels , The Tower by Richard Martin Stern and The Glass Inferno by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson .   The film was a critical success , earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture , and was the highest-grossing film released in 1974 . The film was nominated for eight Oscars in all , winning three .   In addition to McQueen and Newman , the cast includes William Holden , Faye Dunaway , Fred Astaire , Susan Blakely , Richard Chamberlain , O. J. Simpson , Robert Vaughn , Robert Wagner , Susan Flannery , Gregory Sierra , Dabney Coleman and , in her final film , Jennifer Jones .   Plot   Architect Doug Roberts returns to San Francisco for the dedication of the Glass Tower , which he designed for owner James Duncan . At 138 stories ( 1,800 ft/550 m ) , it is the world 's tallest building . Shortly after his arrival , an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor . While Roberts accuses the building 's electrical engineer , Roger Simmons of cutting corners , Simmons insists the building is up to standards .   During the dedication ceremony , public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower 's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries . The lighting overloads the electrical system and Roberts orders it shut off . Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned . Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor but fail to prevent a security guard opening a door , leading to a fire flash which burns Giddings ( and who is later disclosed to have died ) .   Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan , who refuses to order an evacuation . Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze , which soon spreads out of control . SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor , directing them to express elevators . A guest , Lisolette Mueller , who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne , rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family . Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget .   Duncan , aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey , directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe . Not heeding Duncan 's directions , one last group takes an elevator to the ground , but are killed when it stops on the fire 's floor . The fire also traps Bigelow and his secretary/mistress Lorrie in his 65th floor office , killing them .   Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and the family from 87 . Jernigan gets the mother out safely but Roberts , Mueller and the two children are halted by a collapsed stairwell . They make a perilous climb down the stairs but fire forces them up to the Promenade Room . With fire suppression efforts becoming ineffective , the building loses electrical power and O'Halloran 's men are forced to rappel down an elevator shaft .   A rooftop rescue results in disaster as guests rush the helicopter , causing it to crash , setting the roof ablaze and rendering further rooftop rescues impossible . Naval rescue teams attach a breeches buoy to the adjacent Peerless Building and rescue a number of guests , including Duncan 's daughter , Simmons ' wife Patty . Roberts rigs a gravity brake on the external scenic elevator allowing twelve people , including Roberts ' girlfriend Susan , Mueller , and the children , one trip down . An explosion leaves the descending elevator hanging by a single cable at the 110th floor , where Mueller falls to her death . O'Halloran and others save the rest .   Simmons tells Duncan that he and others will use the breeches buoy next , but Duncan punches him , saying the rest will draw numbers but he and his son-in-law will be the last to leave . The fire reaches the Promenade Room and Simmons forces his way onto"], [63, "Band Aid is a charity supergroup featuring mainly British and Irish musicians and recording artists . It was founded in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money for anti-famine efforts in Ethiopia by releasing the song `` Do They Know It 's Christmas ? '' for the Christmas market that year . On 25 November 1984 , the song was recorded at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill , London , and was released in the UK four days later . The single surpassed the hopes of the producers to become the Christmas number one on that release . Two subsequent re-recordings of the song to raise further money for charity also topped the charts . The original was produced by Midge Ure . The 12 '' version was mixed by Trevor Horn . In November 2014 , a new version of the song was recorded by artists under the name of Band Aid 30 .   Background   The supergroup was formed by Bob Geldof , former lead singer of Irish Band The Boomtown Rats . The BBC played a major role in capturing the poverty affecting Ethiopian citizens and thereby influenced Geldof to take action . Paula Yates , Bob Geldof ’ s partner , is considered to have been the brains behind the original Band Aid . It was she who became the driving force that inspired ( and helped ) Geldof to rally the most famous pop stars of the Eighties to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia .   The group was composed of forty artists to raise awareness and funds for the Ethiopian famine in 1983-1985 . The group 's name stemmed from the idea that the musicians were providing aid to the less fortunate and suggested that their project was likened to putting a band-aid on a wound . Geldof was looking for support from all nations for Africa beginning in the United Kingdom . To do so , the artists recorded a hit single titled `` Do They Know It ’ s Christmas ? '' depicting the poverty stricken African scenery of the time . Lyrics of the song included description of the country saying , “ where nothing ever grows , no rain or rivers flow , do they know it ’ s Christmas time at all ? ” Ethiopia follows the Orthodox calendar where Christmas is celebrated on the seventh of January .   Original Band Aid   Chronology ( 1984 )   Geldof was so moved by the plight of starving children in Ethiopia , that he decided to try to raise money using his contacts in pop music . Geldof enlisted the help of Midge Ure , from the group Ultravox , to produce a charity record . Ure took Geldof 's lyrics , and created the melody and backing track for the record . Geldof called many of the most popular British and Irish performers of the time , persuading them to give their time free . His one criterion for selection was how famous they were , in order to maximise sales of the record . He then kept an appointment to appear on a show on BBC Radio 1 , with Richard Skinner , but instead of promoting the new Boomtown Rats material as planned , he announced the plan for Band Aid . The recording studio gave Band Aid no more than 24 free hours to record and mix the record , on 25 November 1984 . The recording took place at SARM Studios in Notting Hill between 11am and 7pm , and was filmed by director Nigel Dick to be released as the pop video though some basic tracks had been recorded the day before at Midge Ure 's home studio . The first tracks to be recorded were the group / choir choruses which were filmed by the international press . The footage was rushed to newsrooms where it aired while the remainder of the recording process continued . Later , drums by Phil Collins were recorded . The introduction of the song features a slowed down sample from a Tears for Fears ' track called `` The Hurting '' , released in 1983 . Tony Hadley , of Spandau Ballet , was the first to record his vocal , while a section sung by Status Quo was deemed unusable , and replaced with section comprising Paul Weller , Sting , and Glenn Gregory , from Heaven 17 . Simon Le Bon from Duran Duran sang between contributions from George Michael and Sting . Paul Young has since admitted , in a documentary , that he knew his opening lines were written for David Bowie , who was not able to make"], [64, "Finland ( ; ; ) , officially the Republic of Finland , is a sovereign state in Europe . A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west , the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest , Norway to the north , and Russia to the east . Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland . Finland is situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia , which also includes Scandinavia . Finland 's population is 5.5 million ( 2014 ) , staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades . The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region . In terms of area , it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union .   Finland is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in the capital Helsinki , local governments in 317 municipalities , and an autonomous region , the Åland Islands . Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area , which produces a third of the country 's GDP . From the late 12th century , Finland was an integral part of Sweden , a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and its official status . In the spirit of the notion of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson ( 1791–1858 ) , `` we are no-longer Swedes , we do not want to become Russians , let us therefore be Finns '' , the Finnish national identity started to establish . Nevertheless , in 1809 , Finland was incorporated into the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland . In 1906 , Finland became the second nation in the world to give the right to vote to all adult citizens and the first in the world to give full suffrage to all adult citizens . Following the 1917 Russian Revolution , Finland declared itself independent .   In 1918 , the fledgling state was divided by civil war , with the Bolshevik-leaning `` Reds '' supported by the equally new Soviet Union , fighting the `` Whites '' , supported by the German Empire . After a brief attempt to establish a kingdom , the country became a republic . During World War II , the Soviet Union sought repeatedly to occupy Finland , with Finland losing parts of Karelia , Salla and Kuusamo , Petsamo and some islands , but retaining independence . Finland joined the United Nations in 1955 and established an official policy of neutrality . The Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948 gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics during the Cold War era . Finland joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) in 1969 , the NATO Partnership for Peace on 1994 , the European Union in 1995 , the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in 1997 , and finally the Eurozone at its inception , in 1999 .   Finland was a relative latecomer to industrialization , remaining a largely agrarian country until the 1950s . It rapidly developed an advanced economy while building an extensive Nordic-style welfare state , resulting in widespread prosperity and one of the highest per capita incomes in the world . However , since 2012 Finnish GDP growth has been negative , with a preceding nadir of −8 % in 2009 . Finland is a top performer in numerous metrics of national performance , including education , economic competitiveness , civil liberties , quality of life , and human development . In 2015 , Finland was ranked first in the World Human Capital and the Press Freedom Index , and as the most stable country in the world in the Failed States Index , and second in the Global Gender Gap Report . A large majority of Finns are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church , though freedom of religion is guaranteed under the Finnish Constitution .   Etymology   Etymology   The first known written appearance of the name Finland is thought to be on three rune-stones . Two were found in the Swedish province of Uppland and have the inscription finlonti ( U 582 ) . The third was found in Gotland , in the Baltic Sea . It has the inscription finlandi ( G 319 ) and dates from the 13th century . The name can be assumed to be related to the tribe name Finns , which is mentioned first known time AD 98 ( disputed meaning ) .   Suomi   The name Suomi ( ) has uncertain origins , but a candidate for a source is the Proto-Baltic word * źemē"], [65, "Santiago ( ; ) , also known as Santiago de Chile , is the capital and largest city of Chile . It is also the center of its largest conurbation . Santiago is located in the country 's central valley , at an elevation of 520 m above mean sea level .   Founded in 1541 , Santiago has been the capital city of Chile since colonial times . The city has a downtown core of 19th century neoclassical architecture and winding side-streets , dotted by art deco , neo-gothic , and other styles . Santiago 's cityscape is shaped by several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing Mapocho River , lined by parks such as Parque Forestal . The Andes Mountains can be seen from most points in the city . These mountains contribute to a considerable smog problem , particularly during winter . The city outskirts are surrounded by vineyards and Santiago is within a few hours of both the mountains and the Pacific Ocean .   Santiago is the cultural , political and financial center of Chile and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations . The Chilean executive and judicial powers are located in Santiago , but Congress meets mostly in nearby Valparaíso . Santiago is named after the biblical figure St. James .   Nomenclature   In Chile , there are several entities which bear the name of `` Santiago '' that are often confused . The Commune of Santiago , sometimes referred to as `` downtown '' or `` Central Santiago '' ( Santiago Centro ) , is an administrative division that comprises roughly the area occupied by the city during its colonial period . The commune , administered by the Municipality of Santiago and headed by a mayor , is part of the Santiago Province headed by a provincial governor , which is in itself a subdivision of the Santiago Metropolitan Region headed by an intendant . Despite these classifications , when the term `` Santiago '' is used without another descriptor , it usually refers to what is also known as Greater Santiago ( Gran Santiago ) , a territorial extension defined by its urban continuity that includes the Commune of Santiago in addition to 36 other communes , which together comprise the majority of the Santiago Province and some areas of neighboring provinces ( see Political divisions ) .   The city and region 's demonym is santiaguinos ( male ) and santiaguinas ( female ) .   History   Founding of the city   According to certain archaeological investigations , it is believed that the first human groups of the X millennium settled in the Santiago basin . The groups were mainly nomadic hunter-gatherers , who traveled from the coast to the interior in search of guanacos during the time of the Andean snowmelt . About the year 800 , the first sedentary inhabitants began to settle due to the formation of agricultural communities along the Mapocho River , mainly maize , potatoes and beans , and the domestication of camelids in the area .   The villages established in the areas belonging to picunches groups ( name given by Chileans ) or promaucaes ( name given by Incas ) , were subject to the Inca Empire throughout the late fifteenth century and into the early sixteenth century . The Incas settled in the valley of mitimaes , the main installation settled in the center of the present city , with strengths as Huaca de Chena and the sanctuary of El Plomo hill . The area would have served as a basis for the failed Inca expeditions southward road junction as the Inca Trail .   Having been sent by Francisco Pizarro from Peru and having made the long journey from Cuzco , Extremadura conquistador Pedro de Valdivia reached the valley of the Mapocho on 13 December 1540 . The hosts of Valdivia camped by the river in the slopes of the Tupahue hill and slowly began to interact with the picunches natives who inhabited the area . Valdivia later summoned the chiefs of the area to a parliament , where he explained his intention to found a city on behalf of the king Carlos I of Spain , which would be the capital of his governorship of Nueva Extremadura . The natives accepted and even recommended the foundation of the town on a small island between two branches of the river next to a small hill called Huelén .   On 12 February 1541 , Valdivia officially founded the city of Santiago del Nuevo Extremo ( Santiago of New Extremadura ) in honor of St. James , patron saint of Spain , near the Huelén ,"], [66, "The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy ( sometimes referred to as HG2G , HHGTTG or H2G2 ) is a comedy science fiction series created by Douglas Adams . Originally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978 , it was later adapted to other formats , including stage shows , novels , comic book adaptations , a 1981 TV series , a 1984 computer game , and 2005 feature film . The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy has become an international multi-media phenomenon . The novels are the most widely distributed , having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005 .   The broad narrative follows the misadventures of the last surviving human , Arthur Dent , following the demolition of the planet Earth by a Vogon constructor fleet to make way for a hyperspace bypass . Dent is rescued from Earth 's destruction by Ford Prefect , a human-like alien writer for the fictional , eccentric , electronic travel guide , The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , by hitchhiking onto a passing spacecraft . Following his rescue , Dent explores the galaxy with Prefect and encounters Trillian , another human that had been taken from Earth prior to its destruction by the President of the Galaxy , the two-headed Zaphod Beeblebrox , and the depressed Marvin , the Paranoid Android . Certain narrative details were changed between the various adaptations .   Plot   The various versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory , as Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation . Throughout all versions , the series follows the adventures of Arthur Dent , a hapless Englishman , following the destruction of the Earth by the Vogons to make way for an intergalactic bypass . Dent 's adventures intersect with several other characters : Ford Prefect ( who named himself after the Ford Prefect car to blend in with what was assumed to be the dominant life form , automobiles ) , an alien from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and a researcher for the eponymous guidebook who rescues Dent from Earth 's destruction ; Zaphod Beeblebrox , Ford 's eccentric semi-cousin and the Galactic President ; the depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android ; and Trillian , formerly known as Tricia McMillan , a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington and the only other human survivor of Earth 's destruction thanks to Beeblebrox ' intervention .   Background   The first radio series comes from a proposal called `` The Ends of the Earth '' : six self-contained episodes , all ending with Earth 's being destroyed in a different way . While writing the first episode , Adams realized that he needed someone on the planet who was an alien to provide some context , and that this alien needed a reason to be there . Adams finally settled on making the alien a roving researcher for a `` wholly remarkable book '' named The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy . As the first radio episode 's writing progressed , the Guide became the centre of his story , and he decided to focus the series on it , with the destruction of Earth being the only hold-over .   Adams claimed that the title came from a 1971 incident while he was hitchhiking around Europe as a young man with a copy of the Hitch-hiker 's Guide to Europe book : while lying drunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking up at the stars , he thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy as well . However , he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten the incident itself , and only remembered himself telling the story . His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of `` hitch-hiking around the galaxy '' to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973 .   Adams 's fictional Guide is an electronic guidebook to the Milky Way galaxy , originally published by Megadodo Publications , one of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor Beta . The narrative of the various versions of the story are frequently punctuated with excerpts from the Guide . The voice of the Guide ( Peter Jones in the first two radio series and TV versions , later William Franklyn in the third , fourth and fifth radio series , and Stephen Fry in the movie version ) , also provides general narration .   Original radio series"], [67, "A still life ( plural still lifes ) is a work of art depicting mostly inanimate subject matter , typically commonplace objects which may be either natural ( food , flowers , dead animals , plants , rocks , or shells ) or man-made ( drinking glasses , books , vases , jewelry , coins , pipes , and so on ) . With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Graeco-Roman art , still-life painting emerged as a distinct genre and professional specialization in Western painting by the late 16th century , and has remained significant since then . Still life gives the artist more freedom in the arrangement of elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as landscape or portraiture . Early still-life paintings , particularly before 1700 , often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted . Some modern still life breaks the two-dimensional barrier and employs three-dimensional mixed media , and uses found objects , photography , computer graphics , as well as video and sound .   Still life emerged from the painting of details in larger compositions with subjects , and historically has been often combined with figure subjects , especially in Flemish Baroque painting . The term includes the painting of dead animals , especially game . Live ones are considered animal art , although in practice they were often painted from dead models . The still-life category also shares commonalities with zoological and especially botanical illustration , where there has been considerable overlap among artists . Generally a still life includes a fully depicted background , and puts aesthetic rather than illustrative concerns as primary . Still life occupied the lowest rung of the hierarchy of genres , but still has been extremely popular with buyers . As well as the independent still-life subject , still-life painting encompasses other types of painting with prominent still-life elements , usually symbolic , and `` images that rely on a multitude of still-life elements ostensibly to reproduce a 'slice of life ' . The trompe-l'œil painting , which intends to deceive the viewer into thinking the scene is real , is a specialized type of still life , usually showing inanimate and relatively flat objects .   Antecedents and development   Still-life paintings often adorn the interior of ancient Egyptian tombs . It was believed that food objects and other items depicted there would , in the afterlife , become real and available for use by the deceased . Ancient Greek vase paintings also demonstrate great skill in depicting everyday objects and animals . Peiraikos is mentioned by Pliny the Elder as a panel painter of `` low '' subjects , such as survive in mosaic versions and provincial wall-paintings at Pompeii : `` barbers ' shops , cobblers ' stalls , asses , eatables and similar subjects '' . Similar still life , more simply decorative in intent , but with realistic perspective , have also been found in the Roman wall paintings and floor mosaics unearthed at Pompeii , Herculaneum and the Villa Boscoreale , including the later familiar motif of a glass bowl of fruit . Decorative mosaics termed `` emblema '' , found in the homes of rich Romans , demonstrated the range of food enjoyed by the upper classes , and also functioned as signs of hospitality and as celebrations of the seasons and of life . By the 16th century , food and flowers would again appear as symbols of the seasons and of the five senses . Also starting in Roman times is the tradition of the use of the skull in paintings as a symbol of mortality and earthly remains , often with the accompanying phrase Omnia mors aequat ( Death makes all equal ) . These vanitas images have been re-interpreted through the last 400 years of art history , starting with Dutch painters around 1600 .   The popular appreciation of the realism of still-life painting is related in the ancient Greek legend of Zeuxis and Parrhasius , who are said to have once competed to create the most lifelike objects , history ’ s earliest descriptions of trompe-l'œil painting . As Pliny the Elder recorded in ancient Roman times , Greek artists centuries earlier were already advanced in the arts of portrait painting , genre painting and still life . He singled out Peiraikos , `` whose artistry is surpassed by only a very few ... He painted barbershops and shoemakers ’ stalls , donkeys , vegetables , and such , and for that reason came to be called the ‘ painter of vulgar subjects ’ ; yet these works are altogether delightful , and they were sold at higher prices"], [68, "The Lake District , also known as The Lakes or Lakeland , is a mountainous region in North-West England . A popular holiday destination , it is famous for its lakes , forests and mountains ( or fells ) and its associations with the early 19th century writings of William Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets .   Historically split between Cumberland , Westmorland and Lancashire , the Lake District is now entirely in Cumbria . All the land in England higher than 3000 ft above sea level lies within the National Park , including Scafell Pike , the highest mountain in England . It also contains the deepest and longest bodies of water in England , respectively Wastwater and Windermere .   Lake District National Park   The Lake District National Park includes nearly all of the Lake District , though the town of Kendal and the Lakeland Peninsulas are currently outside the park boundary .   The area , which was designated a national park on 9 May 1951 ( less than a month after the first UK national park designation — the Peak District ) , is the most visited national park in the United Kingdom with 15.8 million annual visitors and more than 23 million annual day visits , the largest of the thirteen national parks in England and Wales , and the second largest in the UK after the Cairngorms . Its aim is to protect the landscape by restricting unwelcome change by industry or commerce . Most of the land in the park is in private ownership , with about 55 % registered as agricultural land . Landowners include :  * Individual farmers and other private landowners , with more than half of the agricultural land farmed by the owners .  * The National Trust owns about a quarter of the total area ( including some lakes and land of significant landscape value ) .  * The Forestry Commission and other investors in forests and woodland .  * United Utilities owns 8 %  * Lake District National Park Authority ( 3.9 % ) The National Park Authority is based at offices in Kendal . It runs a visitor centre on Windermere at a former country house called Brockhole , Coniston Boating Centre , and Information Centres . It is reducing its landholding .   In common with all other national parks in England , there is no restriction on entry to , or movement within the park along public routes , but access to cultivated land is usually restricted to public footpaths , bridleways and byways . Much of the uncultivated land has statutory open access rights - which cover around 50 % of the park .   The lakes and mountains combine to form impressive scenery . Farmland and settlement add aesthetic value to the natural scenery with an ecology modified by human influence for millennia and including important wildlife habitats . The Lake District failed in a previous attempt to gain World Heritage status as a natural World Heritage Site , because of human activities , such as commercial forestry , which have adversely impacted the park 's assessment . However , in 2016 the [ http : //www.lakesworldheritage.co.uk English Lake District bid ] for World Heritage Status was submitted to UNESCO in the category of cultural landscape . A decision is expected in 2017 .   Extension to the National Park   In December 2009 , Natural England proposed extending the National Park in the direction of the Yorkshire Dales National Park . This would include land of high landscape value in the Lune Valley . The proposal was opposed by Cumbria County Council who said it would lead to less democratic control and would make local housing less affordable . A public inquiry was held into the proposals , which required a decision by the Secretary of State . The decision to recommend approval was announced on October 23 , 2015 , and the size of the park increased by 3 % on 1 August 2016 .   Human geography   General   The precise extent of the Lake District was not defined traditionally , but is slightly larger than that of the National Park , the total area of which is about 885 sqmi . The park extends just over 32 mi from east to west and nearly 40 mi from north to south , with areas such as the Lake District Peninsulas to the south lying outside the National Park .   Settlement   The Lake District is one of the most highly populated national parks . There are , however , only a handful of major settlements within this"], [69, "A metal ( from Greek μέταλλον métallon , `` mine , quarry , metal '' ) is a material ( an element , compound , or alloy ) that is typically hard , opaque , shiny , and has good electrical and thermal conductivity . Metals are generally malleable — that is , they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking — as well as fusible ( able to be fused or melted ) and ductile ( able to be drawn out into a thin wire ) . About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals , the others are nonmetals or metalloids . Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms .   Astrophysicists use the term `` metal '' to collectively describe all elements other than hydrogen and helium . In that sense , the metallicity of an object is the proportion of its matter made up of chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium .   Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures ; these are formed as metallic allotropes of non-metals .   Structure and bonding   The atoms of metallic substances are typically arranged in one of three common crystal structures , namely body-centered cubic ( bcc ) , face-centered cubic ( fcc ) , and hexagonal close-packed ( hcp ) . In bcc , each atom is positioned at the center of a cube of eight others . In fcc and hcp , each atom is surrounded by twelve others , but the stacking of the layers differs . Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature .   Atoms of metals readily lose their outer shell electrons , resulting in a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement . This provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity . While this flow of electrons occurs , the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud . This type of bond is called a metallic bond .   Properties   Chemical   Metals are usually inclined to form cations through electron loss , reacting with oxygen in the air to form oxides over various timescales ( iron rusts over years , while potassium burns in seconds ) . Examples :   4 Na + O2 → 2 Na2O ( sodium oxide )  2 Ca + O2 → 2 CaO ( calcium oxide )  4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3 ( aluminium oxide ) .   The transition metals ( such as iron , copper , zinc , and nickel ) are slower to oxidize because they form a passivating layer of oxide that protects the interior . Others , like palladium , platinum and gold , do not react with the atmosphere at all . Some metals form a barrier layer of oxide on their surface which can not be penetrated by further oxygen molecules and thus retain their shiny appearance and good conductivity for many decades ( like aluminium , magnesium , some steels , and titanium ) . The oxides of metals are generally basic , as opposed to those of nonmetals , which are acidic . Exceptions are largely oxides with very high oxidation states such as CrO3 , Mn2O7 , and OsO4 , which have strictly acidic reactions .   Painting , anodizing or plating metals are good ways to prevent their corrosion . However , a more reactive metal in the electrochemical series must be chosen for coating , especially when chipping of the coating is expected . Water and the two metals form an electrochemical cell , and if the coating is less reactive than the coatee , the coating actually promotes corrosion .   Physical   Metals in general have high electrical conductivity , high thermal conductivity , and high density . Typically they are malleable and ductile , deforming under stress without cleaving . In terms of optical properties , metals are shiny and lustrous . Sheets of metal beyond a few micrometres in thickness appear opaque , but gold leaf transmits green light .   Although most metals have higher densities than most nonmetals , there is wide variation in their densities , lithium being the least dense solid element and osmium the densest . The alkali and alkaline earth metals in groups I A and II A are referred to as the light metals because they have low density , low hardness , and low melting points . The high density of most metals is due to the tightly"], [70, "Edward Regan `` Eddie '' Murphy ( born April 3 , 1961 ) is an American comedian , an actor , a writer , a singer , and a producer .   He was a regular cast member on Saturday Night Live from 1980 to 1984 . He has worked as a stand-up comedian , and was ranked # 10 on Comedy Central 's list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time .   In films , he has received Golden Globe Award nominations for his performances in 48 Hrs. , the Beverly Hills Cop series , Trading Places , and The Nutty Professor . In 2007 , he won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of soul singer James `` Thunder '' Early in Dreamgirls .   His work as a voice actor in films includes : Thurgood Stubbs in The PJs , Donkey in DreamWorks ' Shrek series , and the Chinese dragon Mushu in Disney 's Mulan . In some films , he plays multiple roles in addition to his main character , intended as a tribute to one of his idols Peter Sellers , who played multiple roles in Dr. Strangelove and elsewhere . He has played multiple roles in Coming to America , Wes Craven 's Vampire in Brooklyn , the Nutty Professor films ( where he played the title role in two incarnations , plus his character 's father , brother , mother , and grandmother ) , Bowfinger , The Adventures of Pluto Nash , Norbit , and Meet Dave .   As of 2014 , Murphy 's films have grossed over $ 3.8 billion in the United States and Canada box office , and $ 6.6 billion worldwide . In 2015 , his films made him the 6th-highest grossing actor in the United States .   Murphy was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts .   Early life   Murphy was born in Brooklyn , New York City , and raised in the borough 's Bushwick neighborhood . His mother , Lillian , was a telephone operator , and his father , Charles Edward Murphy , was a transit police officer and an amateur actor and comedian .   His father died when he was young .  When Murphy 's single mother became ill , the eight-year-old and his older brother lived in foster care for one year . In interviews , Murphy has said that his time in foster care was influential in developing his sense of humor . Later , he and his older brother Charlie were raised in Roosevelt , New York by his mother and stepfather Vernon Lynch , a foreman at an ice cream plant .   Around the age of 15 , Murphy was writing and performing his own routines , which were heavily influenced by Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor .   Career   Stand-up comedy   His early comedy was characterized by frequent swearing and sketches lampooning a diverse group of people ( including White Anglo-Saxon Protestants ( WASPs ) , African Americans , Italian Americans , overweight people , and gay people ) . Murphy released two stand-up specials . Eddie Murphy was his first album , released in 1982 . Delirious was filmed in 1983 in Washington , D.C. Due to the popularity of Delirious , his concert film Eddie Murphy Raw ( 1987 ) received a wide theatrical release , grossing $ 50 million ; the movie was filmed in the Felt Forum section of Madison Square Garden in New York .   1980s acting career   Murphy first earned national attention as a cast member on Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) , and was credited with helping to revitalize the show during the early 1980s . His notable characters included a grownup version of the Little Rascals character Buckwheat ; a street-wise children 's show host named Mr. Robinson ( a spoof of Fred Rogers , who found it amusing ) ; and a morose , cynical Gumby , whose trademark slogan became an SNL catchphrase : `` I 'm Gumby , dammit ! ''   The Buckwheat character was retired in spectacular fashion—assassinated , on camera , in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza—at Murphy 's request , after he grew tired of constant demands from fans to `` Do Buckwheat ! Do Buckwheat ! '' In Rolling Stone magazine 's February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to date , Murphy was ranked second ( behind John Belushi ) . ``"], [71, "The piano is a musical instrument played using a keyboard , which is a row of keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands . Invented in about 1700 ( the exact date is uncertain ) , the piano is widely employed in classical , jazz , traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances , accompaniment , and for composing and rehearsal . Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones . With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed . The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced .   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments . The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe . During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings . By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key . Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case , soundboard , bridge , and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings .   Invention   The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori ( 1655–1731 ) of Padua , Italy , who was employed by Ferdinando de ' Medici , Grand Prince of Tuscany , as the Keeper of the Instruments ; he was an expert harpsichord maker , and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments .

It is dedicated to the image and arms of Saint George , England 's patron saint .   It is awarded at the Sovereign 's pleasure as a personal gift on recipients from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms . Membership of the Order is limited to the Sovereign , the Prince of Wales , and no more than 24 members , or Companions . The order also includes supernumerary knights and ladies ( e.g . members of the British Royal Family and foreign monarchs ) .   New appointments to the Order of the Garter are always announced on St George 's Day ( 23 April ) , as Saint George is the order 's patron saint .   The order 's emblem is a garter with the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense ( Middle French : `` shame on him who thinks evil of it '' ) in gold lettering . Members of the order wear it on ceremonial occasions .   History   King Edward III founded the Order of the Garter around the time of his claim to the French throne . The year is usually presumed to be 1348 , however , the Complete Peerage , under `` The Founders of the Order of the Garter '' , states the order was first instituted on 23 April 1344 , listing each founding member as knighted in 1344 . The list includes Sir Sanchet D'Abrichecourt , who died on 20 October 1345 . Other dates from 1344 to 1351 have also been proposed . The King 's wardrobe account shows Garter habits first issued in the autumn of 1348 . Also , its original statutes required that each member of the Order already be a knight ( what would now be referred to as a knight bachelor ) and some of the initial members listed were only knighted that year .   The earliest written mention of the Order is found in Tirant lo Blanch , a chivalric romance written in Catalan mainly by Valencian Joanot Martorell . It was first published in 1490 . This book devotes a chapter to the description of the origin of the Order of the Garter .   List of Founder Knights   At the time of its foundation , the Order consisted of King Edward III , together with 25 Founder Knights , listed in ascending order of stall number in St. George 's Chapel :  * King Edward III ( 1312–77 )  * Edward , the Black Prince , Prince of Wales ( 1330–76 )  * Henry of Grosmont , Earl of Lancaster ( c. 1310–61 )  * Thomas , Earl of Warwick ( d. 1369 )  * Jean de Grailly , Captal de Buch ( d. 1377 )  * Ralph , Lord Stafford ( 1301–72 )  * William , Earl of Salisbury ( 1328–97 )  * Roger , Earl of March ( 1328–60 )  * John , Lord Lisle ( 1318–56 )  * Bartholomew , Lord Burghersh ( d. 1369 )  * John , Lord Beauchamp ( d. 1360 )  * John , Lord Mohun ( c. 1320–76 )  * Sir Hugh de Courtenay ( d. 1349 )  * Thomas , Earl of Kent ( 1314-1360 )  * John , Lord Grey de Rotherfield ( c. 1300–59 )  * Sir Richard Fitz-Simon ( b . 1295 )  * Sir Miles Stapleton ( d. 1364 )  * Sir Thomas Wale ( d. 1352 )  * Sir Hugh Wrottesley ( d. 1381 )  * Sir Nele Loring ( d. 1386 )  * Sir John Chandos ( d. 1369 )  * Sir James Audley ( d. 1369 )  * Sir Otho Holand ( d. 1359 )  * Sir Henry Eam ( d. before 1360 )  * Sir Sanchet D'Abrichecourt ( d. 1345 )  * Sir Walter Paveley ( d. 1375 )  They are all depicted in individual portraits in the Bruges Garter Book made c. 1431 .   Legendary origins   Various legends account for the origin of the Order . The most popular legend involves the `` Countess of Salisbury '' ( either Edward 's future daughter-in-law Joan of Kent or her former mother-in-law , Catherine Montacute , Countess of Salisbury ) . While she was dancing at a court ball at Calais , her garter is"], [73, "Beaujolais nouveau is a red wine made from Gamay grapes produced in the Beaujolais region of France . It is the most popular vin de primeur , fermented for just a few weeks before being released for sale on the third Thursday of November . This `` Beaujolais Nouveau Day '' used to see heavy marketing , with races to get the first bottles to different markets around the globe . The current release practice is to ship the wine ahead of the third Thursday of November , and release it to the local markets at 12:01 a.m. local time .   History   Beaujolais had always made a vin de l'année to celebrate the end of the harvest , but until WWII it was only for local consumption . In fact , once the Beaujolais AOC was established in 1937 , AOC rules meant that Beaujolais wine could only be officially sold after 15 December in the year of harvest . Warning - plays music by default These rules were relaxed on 13 November 1951 , and the Union Interprofessionnelle des Vins du Beaujolais ( UIVB ) formally set 15 November as the release date for what would henceforth be known as Beaujolais nouveau .   A few members of the UIVB saw the potential for marketing Beaujolais nouveau . Not only was it a way to clear lots of vin ordinaire at a good profit , but selling wine within weeks of the harvest was great for cash flow . Hence the idea was born of a race to Paris carrying the first bottles of the new vintage . This attracted a lot of media coverage , and by the 1970s had become a national event . The races spread to neighbouring countries in Europe in the 1980s , followed by North America , and in the 1990s to Asia . In 1985 , the date was changed to the third Thursday in November to take best advantage of marketing in the following weekend .   Production   Beaujolais nouveau is made from the Gamay noir à Jus blanc grape , better known simply as Gamay . The grapes must come from the Beaujolais AOC , with those of the ten `` cru '' appellations excluded . They are grown in `` stony , schistous soils '' . Both Beaujolais Nouveau and Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau are produced ; the latter comes from the ~ 30 non-cru villages in the region .   By law , all grapes in the region must be harvested by hand . The wine is made using carbonic maceration , whole berry anaerobic fermentation which emphasizes fruit flavors without extracting bitter tannins from the grape skins . Grapes are loaded into a large ( think 20,000 gallon ) sealed container that is filled with carbon dioxide . Grapes that are gently crushed at the bottom of the container by the weight of the grapes start to ferment , emitting more CO2 . All this carbon dioxide causes fermentation to take place inside the uncrushed grapes ( without access to oxygen , hence `` anaerobic fermentation '' ) . The resulting wine is fresh , fruity , and very low in tannins .   Celebration    This `` Beaujolais Day '' is accompanied by publicity events and heavy advertising . The traditional slogan , even in English-speaking countries , was `` Le Beaujolais nouveau est arrivé ! '' ( literally , `` The new Beaujolais has arrived ! `` ) , but in 2005 this was changed to `` It 's Beaujolais Nouveau Time ! `` . In the United States , it is promoted as a drink for Thanksgiving , which always falls exactly one week after the wine is released ( on the fourth Thursday of November ) . Many producers release the nouveau with colourful or abstract design that changes every year , usually as an evolution from the previous year 's design . Duboeuf has silk ties made each year with their label 's abstract design , and releases them through select wholesalers and distributors .   Style   Beaujolais nouveau is a purple-pink wine reflecting its youth , bottled only 6-8 weeks after harvest . The method of production means that there is very little tannin , and the wine can be dominated by such fruity ester flavours as banana , grape , strawberry , fig and pear drop . The wine is recommended to be slightly chilled to 13°C ( 55°F ) .   Beaujolais nouveau is intended for immediate drinking .

Prior to this he was the 40th Vice President of the United States , serving from 1973 until President Richard Nixon 's resignation in 1974 . He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment , following the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew on October 10 , 1973 . Becoming president upon Richard Nixon 's departure on August 9 , 1974 , he claimed the distinction as the first and to date the only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to either office . As he was appointed to fill a vacancy and then succeeded to the presidency , Ford also earned the distinction of being the only person in American history to neither begin nor finish either a presidential or vice presidential term on the date of a regularly-scheduled inauguration . Before ascending to the vice presidency , Ford served 25 years as Representative from Michigan 's 5th congressional district , the final 9 of them as the House Minority Leader .   As President , Ford signed the Helsinki Accords , marking a move toward détente in the Cold War . With the conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency , U.S. involvement in Vietnam essentially ended . Domestically , Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression , with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure . One of his more controversial acts was to grant a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal . During Ford 's presidency , foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play , and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President . In the GOP presidential primary campaign of 1976 , Ford defeated then-former California Governor Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination . He narrowly lost the presidential election to the Democratic challenger , then-former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter , on November 2 .   Following his years as President , Ford remained active in the Republican Party . After experiencing health problems , he died in his home on December 26 , 2006 . Ford lived longer than any other U.S. president , 93 years and 165 days , while his 895-day presidency remains the shortest term of all presidents who did not die in office . As of 2016 , he is also the most recent former president and vice president to die .   Early life   Gerald Rudolph Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. , on July 14 , 1913 , at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha , Nebraska , where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents . His mother was Dorothy Ayer Gardner , and his father was Leslie Lynch King Sr. , a wool trader and a son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King ( née Porter ) . Dorothy separated from King just sixteen days after her son 's birth . She took her son with her to the Oak Park , Illinois , home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law , Clarence Haskins James . From there , she moved to the home of her parents , Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer , in Grand Rapids , Michigan . Dorothy and King divorced in December 1913 ; she gained full custody of her son . Ford 's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930 .   Ford later said his biological father had a history of hitting his mother . James M. Cannon , a member of the Ford administration , wrote in a biography of Ford that the Kings ' separation and divorce were sparked when , a few days after Ford 's birth , Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife , his infant son , and Ford 's nursemaid . Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man .   After two and a half years with her parents , on February 1 , 1916 , Dorothy married Gerald Rudolff Ford , a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company . They then called her son Gerald Rudolff Ford Jr . The future president was never formally adopted , and did not"], [75, "A mosque ( ; from Al-masjid ) is a place of worship for followers of Islam .   There are strict and detailed requirements in Sunni fiqh for a place of worship to be considered a masjid  , with places that do not meet these requirements regarded as musallas . There are stringent restrictions on the uses of the area formally demarcated as the mosque ( which is often a small portion of the larger complex ) , and , in the Islamic Sharia law , after an area is formally designated as a mosque , it remains so until the Last Day .   Many mosques have elaborate domes , minarets , and prayer halls , in varying styles of architecture . Mosques originated on the Arabian Peninsula , but are now found in all inhabited continents . The mosque serves as a place where Muslims can come together for salat ( ṣalāt , meaning `` prayer '' ) as well as a center for information , education , social welfare , and dispute settlement . The imam leads the congregation in prayer .   Etymology   The word entered English from a French word that probably derived from Italian moschea , a variant of Italian moscheta , from either Middle Armenian մզկիթ ( mzkit ‘ ) or Medieval Greek μασγίδιον ( masgídion ) or Spanish mezquita , from the Arabic masjid meaning `` place of worship '' or `` prostration in prayer '' , either from Nabataean masgĕdhā́ or from Arabic sajada meaning `` to bow down in prayer '' , probably ultimately from Aramaic sĕghēdh.For the word 's origin from French and probable origin from Italian moscheta , see `` mosque , n.

History   The first mosque in the world is often considered to be the area around the Kaaba in Mecca now known as the Masjid al-Haram . Since as early as 638 AD , the Masjid al-Haram has been expanded on several occasions to accommodate the increasing number of Muslims who either live in the area or make the annual pilgrimage known as hajj to the city . Others regard the first mosque in history to be the Quba Mosque in present-day Medina since it was the first structure built by Muhammad upon his emigration from Mecca in 622 .   The Islamic Prophet Muhammad went on to establish another mosque in Medina , which is now known as the Masjid an-Nabawi , or the Prophet 's Mosque . Built on the site of his home , Muhammad participated in the construction of the mosque himself and helped pioneer the concept of the mosque as the focal point of the Islamic city . The Masjid al-Nabawi introduced some of the features still common in today 's mosques , including the niche at the front of the prayer space known as the mihrab and the tiered pulpit called the minbar . The Masjid al-Nabawi was also constructed with a large courtyard , a motif common among mosques built since then .   Diffusion and evolution   Mosques had been built in Iraq and North Africa by the end of the 7th century , as Islam spread outside the Arabian Peninsula with early caliphates . The Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala is reportedly one of the oldest mosques in Iraq , although its present form - typical of Persian architecture - only goes back to the 11th century . The shrine , while still operating as a mosque , remains one of the holiest sites for Shia Muslims , as it honors the death of the third Shia imam , and Prophet Muhammad 's grandson , Hussein ibn Ali . The Mosque of Amr ibn al-As was reportedly the first mosque in Egypt , serving as a religious and social center for Fustat ( present-day Cairo ) during its prime . Like the Imam Husayn Shrine , though , nothing of"], [76, "Benin ( or ; ) , officially the Republic of Benin ( ) and formerly Dahomey , is a country in West Africa . It is bordered by Togo to the west , Nigeria to the east , and Burkina Faso and Niger to the north . A majority of the population live on its small southern coastline on the Bight of Benin , part of the Gulf of Guinea in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean . The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo , but the seat of government is in Cotonou , the country 's largest city and economic capital . Benin covers an area of 114,763 square kilometers and its population in 2015 was estimated to be approximately 10.88 million . Benin is a tropical , sub-Saharan nation , highly dependent on agriculture , with substantial employment and income arising from subsistence farming .   The official language of Benin is French . However , indigenous languages such as Fon and Yoruba are commonly spoken . The largest religious group in Benin is Roman Catholicism , followed closely by Islam , Vodun and Protestantism . Benin is a member of the United Nations , the African Union , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone , La Francophonie , the Community of Sahel-Saharan States , the African Petroleum Producers Association and the Niger Basin Authority .   From the 17th to the 19th century , the main political entities in the area were the Kingdom of Dahomey along with the city-state of Porto-Novo and a large area with many different tribes to the north . This region was referred to as the Slave Coast from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of slaves shipped to the New World during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade . After slavery was abolished , France took over the country and renamed it French Dahomey . In 1960 , Dahomey gained full independence from France , and had a tumultuous period with many different democratic governments , many military coups and military governments .   A Marxist–Leninist state called the People 's Republic of Benin existed between 1975 and 1990 . In 1991 , it was replaced by the current multi-party Republic of Benin .   Etymology   During the colonial period and at independence , the country was known as Dahomey . On 30 November 1975 it was renamed to Benin , after the body of water on which the country lies—the Bight of Benin—which , in turn , had been named after the Benin Empire ( nowadays Nigeria ) . The country of Benin has no connection to Benin City in modern Nigeria , nor to the Benin bronzes .   The new name , Benin , was chosen for its neutrality . Dahomey was the name of the former Kingdom of Dahomey , which covered only most of the southern third of the present country and therefore did not represent Porto-Novo ( a rival state in the south ) , the northwestern sector Atakora , nor the kingdom of Borgu , which covered the northeastern third .   History   Precolonial history   The current country of Benin combines three areas which had different political and ethnic systems prior to French colonial control . Before 1700 , there were a few important city states along the coast ( primarily of the Aja ethnic group , but also including Yoruba and Gbe peoples ) and a mass of tribal regions inland ( composed of Bariba , Mahi , Gedevi , and Kabye peoples ) . The Oyo Empire , located primarily to the east of modern Benin , was the most significant large-scale military force in the region and it would regularly conduct raids and exact tribute from the coastal kingdoms and the tribal regions . The situation changed in the 1600s and early 1700s as the Kingdom of Dahomey , which was of Fon ethnicity , was founded on the Abomey plateau and began taking over areas along the coast . By 1727 , king Agaja of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of Allada and Whydah , but it had become a tributary of the Oyo empire and did not directly attack the Oyo allied city-state of Porto-Novo . The rise of the kingdom of Dahomey , the rivalry between the kingdom and the city of Porto-Novo , and the continued tribal politics of the northern region , persisted into the colonial and post-colonial periods .   The Dahomey Kingdom was known for its culture and traditions . Young boys were often apprenticed to older soldiers , and taught the kingdom 's military"], [77, "Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling .

It is the group 's biggest selling single to date and was the final single to feature founding member Kerry Katona , who left the group mid-way through promoting the single . `` Whole Again '' was the first single released from the album in Europe , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . It was a massive success , reaching number one in several countries , and sold 1 million copies in the UK alone . Among the song 's writers was OMD frontman and Atomic Kitten founder Andy McCluskey , who achieved his only UK number one single with the track .   Following the departure of Katona , she was replaced a few days later by Jenny Frost , just after the single reached number one in the UK . As a result , the music video was reshot and Frost 's vocals appeared on the reissue of Right Now .   Background   Following the failures of previous single `` Follow Me '' and the initial release of their debut album , Right Now , Atomic Kitten persuaded Virgin Records to release the single as a last-ditch attempt to keep their record deal . They were given a shoe-string budget for the single 's release with a basic video and previous photo shoots used for cover artwork . During promotion for the single , band member Kerry Katona announced her pregnancy and subsequent decision to leave the group . With the single 's release imminent , the group opted to recruit Jenny Frost as a replacement and continued their promotional campaign . Surprisingly the single was a massive success , beating U2 to the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart and remaining there for four consecutive weeks .   .In a rare Asian pressing of their Right Now album , the song `` Whole Again '' features all lines spoken by Katona with only the chorus sung by the girls which was taken from the Japanese version of Right Now . The original version of Right Now features Katona 's vocals ; however , the reissue of the album features new vocals by Jenny Frost . This version has since replaced Katona 's version for radio airplay , and it was subsequently issued as a bonus track on international versions of the group 's second album , Feels So Good .   The first line of the song is identical to that of `` Walk on By '' by Bacharach and David .   Music video   The music video for `` Whole Again '' was filmed on a very small budget due to the commercial failure of previous single `` Follow Me '' . It features the girls singing in front of a plain white background – similar to the video for the Sugababes ' debut single `` Overload '' . The original version of the video includes Kerry Katona , who had left the group just before the song 's release . Much of the video was subsequently reshot to feature new member Jenny Frost .   As a result of the single 's huge success in many international markets , a second music video was filmed for the U.S. release with a much larger budget . This version features the three girls walking through the streets in Downtown Los Angeles and walking out into the countryside , gradually picking up more people along the way . The video ends with the camera zooming out on the field for Atomic Kitten 's old logo is invisible in a shape of a kitten .

He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the war god Mars , and is known in Latin also as Amor ( `` Love '' ) . His Greek counterpart is Eros.Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia , The Book People , Haydock , 1995 , p. 215 .   Although Eros is in Classical Greek art as a slender winged youth , during the Hellenistic period , he was increasingly portrayed as a chubby boy . During this time , his iconography acquired the bow and arrow that represent his source of power : a person , or even a deity , who is shot by Cupid 's arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire . In myths , Cupid is a minor character who serves mostly to set the plot in motion . He is a main character only in the tale of Cupid and Psyche , when wounded by his own weapons he experiences the ordeal of love . Although other extended stories are not told about him , his tradition is rich in poetic themes and visual scenarios , such as `` Love conquers all '' and the retaliatory punishment or torture of Cupid .   In art , Cupid often appears in multiples as the Amores , or amorini in the later terminology of art history , the equivalent of the Greek erotes . Cupids are a frequent motif of both Roman art and later Western art of the classical tradition . In the 15th century , the iconography of Cupid starts to become indistinguishable from the putto .   Cupid continued to be a popular figure in the Middle Ages , when under Christian influence he often had a dual nature as Heavenly and Earthly love . In the Renaissance , a renewed interest in classical philosophy endowed him with complex allegorical meanings . In contemporary popular culture , Cupid is shown drawing his bow to inspire romantic love , often as an icon of Valentine 's Day .   Origins and birth   The Romans reinterpreted myths and concepts pertaining to the Greek Eros for Cupid in their own literature and art , and medieval and Renaissance mythographers conflate the two freely . In the Greek tradition , Eros had a dual , contradictory genealogy . He was among the primordial gods who came into existence asexually ; after his generation , deities were begotten through male-female unions . In Hesiod 's Theogony , only Chaos and Gaia ( Earth ) are older . Before the existence of gender dichotomy , Eros functioned by causing entities to separate from themselves that which they already contained .   At the same time , the Eros who was pictured as a boy or slim youth was regarded as the child of a divine couple , the identity of whom varied by source . The influential Renaissance mythographer Natale Conti began his chapter on Cupid/Eros by declaring that the Greeks themselves were unsure about his parentage : Heaven and Earth , Ares and Aphrodite , Night and Ether , or Strife and Zephyr . The Greek travel writer Pausanias , he notes , contradicts himself by saying at one point that Eros welcomed Aphrodite into the world , and at another that Eros was the son of Aphrodite and the youngest of the gods .   In Latin literature , Cupid is usually treated as the son of Venus without reference to a father . Seneca says that Vulcan , as the husband of Venus , is the father of Cupid . Cicero , however , says that there were three Cupids , as well as three Venuses : the first Cupid was the son of Mercury and Diana , the second of Mercury and the second Venus , and the third of Mars and the third Venus . This last Cupid was the equivalent of Anteros , `` Counter-Love , '' one of the Erotes , the gods who embody aspects of love . The multiple Cupids frolicking in art are the decorative manifestation of these proliferating loves and desires . During the English Renaissance , Christopher Marlowe wrote of `` ten thousand Cupids '' ; in Ben Jonson 's wedding masque Hymenaei , `` a thousand several-coloured loves ... hop about the nuptial room '' .   In the later classical tradition , Cupid is most often regarded as the son of Venus and Mars , whose love affair represented an allegory of Love and War . The duality between the primordial and the sexually conceived Eros"], [80, "Norway ( ; Norwegian : ( Bokmål ) or ( Nynorsk ) ) , officially the Kingdom of Norway , is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard . The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom . Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land . Until 1814 , the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands ( since 1035 ) , Greenland ( 1261 ) , and Iceland ( 1262 ) . It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468 .   Norway has a total area of 385252 km2 and a population of 5 213 985 ( May 2016 ) . The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden ( 1,619 km or 1,006 mi long ) . Norway is bordered by Finland and Russia to the north-east , and the Skagerrak Strait to the south , with Denmark on the other side . Norway has an extensive coastline , facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea .   King Harald V of the German House of Glücksburg is the current King of Norway . Erna Solberg became Prime Minister in 2013 , replacing Jens Stoltenberg . A constitutional monarchy , Norway divides state power between the Parliament , the Cabinet , and the Supreme Court , as determined by the 1814 Constitution . The Kingdom is established as a merger of several petty kingdoms . By the traditional count from the year 872 the Kingdom has existed continuously for 1,144 years , and the list of Norwegian monarchs includes over sixty kings and earls .   Norway has both administrative and political subdivisions on two levels : counties and municipalities . The Sámi people have a certain amount of self-determination and influence over traditional territories through the Sámi Parliament and the Finnmark Act . Norway maintains close ties with the European Union and the United States . Norway is a founding member of the United Nations , NATO , the Council of Europe , the Antarctic Treaty and the Nordic Council ; a member of the European Economic Area , the WTO and the OECD ; and is also a part of the Schengen Area .   The country maintains a combination of market economy and a Nordic welfare model with universal health care and a comprehensive social security system . Norway has extensive reserves of petroleum , natural gas , minerals , lumber , seafood , fresh water , and hydropower . The petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of the country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) . On a per-capita basis , Norway is the world 's largest producer of oil and natural gas outside the Middle East .   The country has the fourth-highest per capita income in the world on the World Bank and IMF lists . On the CIA 's GDP ( PPP ) per capita list ( 2015 estimate ) which includes territories and some regions , Norway ranks as number eleven . From 2001 to 2006 , and then again from 2009 to 2015 , Norway had the highest Human Development Index ranking in the world . Norway has topped the Legatum Prosperity Index for seven years in a row as of 2015 . Norway ranks also first on the OECD Better Life Index , the Index of Public Integrity , and the Democracy Index .   Etymology   Norway has two official names : Noreg in Nynorsk ( Old Norse : Noregr ) and Norge in Bokmål ( Old Norse : Noregi , dative of Noregr ) .   The name Norway comes from the Old Norse word norðrvegr , `` northern way '' or `` way leading to the north '' , which the Geats and the Danes named the coastline of western Norway , contrasting with suðrvegar `` southern way '' for Germany , and austrvegr `` eastern way '' for the Baltic .   Philology professor Magnus Olsen wrote that norðrvegr refers to the inner-archipelago sailing route of southwestern Norway , the home area of Harald Fairhair , the first king of Norway , and that because of him , the name was extended to the entire country . The newer interpretation of the syllable is Norvegr , where nor ( ve ) - means narrow ( ) and - ( ve ) gr ( ) means way that refers to the sailing routes through the straits of Norway . The old meaning of the word is interpreted as `` The narrow way through the"], [81, "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea ( , literally Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas : An Underwater Tour of the World ) is a classic science fiction novel by French writer Jules Verne published in 1870 .   The novel was originally serialized from March 1869 through June 1870 in Pierre-Jules Hetzel 's periodical , the Magasin d ’ Éducation et de Récréation . The deluxe illustrated edition , published by Hetzel in November 1871 , included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou . The book was highly acclaimed when released and still is now ; it is regarded as one of the premiere adventure novels and one of Verne 's greatest works , along with Around the World in Eighty Days and Journey to the Center of the Earth . The description of Nemo 's ship , called the Nautilus , was considered ahead of its time , as it accurately describes features on submarines , which at the time were very primitive vessels . Thus , the book has been able to age well because of its scientific theories , unlike some of Verne 's other works , like Journey to the Center of the Earth , which are not scientifically accurate and serve more simply as adventure novels .   Title   The title refers to the distance traveled while under the sea and not to a depth , as 20,000 leagues is over six times the diameter , and nearly three times the circumference of the Earth . The greatest depth mentioned in the book is four leagues . ( The book uses metric leagues , which are four kilometres each . ) A literal translation of the French title would end in the plural `` seas '' , thus implying the `` seven seas '' through which the characters of the novel travel ; however , the early English translations of the title used `` sea '' , meaning the ocean in general .   Plot   During the year 1866 , ships of several nations spot a mysterious sea monster , which some suggest to be a giant narwhal . The United States government assembles an expedition in New York City to find and destroy the monster . Professor Pierre Aronnax , a French marine biologist and narrator of the story , who happens to be in New York at the time , receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition which he accepts . Canadian whaler and master harpoonist Ned Land and Aronnax 's faithful servant Conseil are also brought aboard .   The expedition departs Brooklyn aboard the United States Navy frigate Abraham Lincoln and travels south around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean . The ship finds the monster after a long search and then attacks the beast , which damages the ship 's rudder . The three protagonists are then hurled into the water and grasp hold of the `` hide '' of the creature , which they find , to their surprise , to be a submarine very far ahead of its era . They are quickly captured and brought inside the vessel , where they meet its enigmatic creator and commander , Captain Nemo .   The rest of the story follows the adventures of the protagonists aboard the creature—the submarine , the Nautilus—which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas free from any land-based government . Captain Nemo 's motivation is implied to be both a scientific thirst for knowledge and a desire for revenge on ( and self-imposed exile from ) civilization . Nemo explains that his submarine is electrically powered and can perform advanced marine biology research ; he also tells his new passengers that although he appreciates conversing with such an expert as Aronnax , maintaining the secrecy of his existence requires never letting them leave . Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the undersea adventures , but Ned Land can only think of escape .   They visit many places under the oceans , some real-life places , others completely fictional . Thus , the travelers witness the real corals of the Red Sea , the wrecks of the battle of Vigo Bay , the Antarctic ice shelves , the Transatlantic telegraph cable and the fictional submerged land of Atlantis . The travelers also use diving suits to hunt sharks and other marine life with air-guns and have an underwater funeral for a crew member who died when an accident occurred under mysterious—and unknown to the reader—conditions inside the Nautilus . When the Nautilus returns to the Atlantic Ocean , a pack of `` poulpes '' ( usually translated as a giant squid , although in French `` poulpe"], [82, "In computing , a computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as a mechanical lever or electronic switch . Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape , interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input device for computers .   A keyboard typically has characters engraved or printed on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol . However , to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence . While most keyboard keys produce letters , numbers or signs ( characters ) , other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or execute computer commands .   Despite the development of alternative input devices , such as the mouse , touchscreen , pen devices , character recognition and voice recognition , the keyboard remains the most commonly used device for direct ( human ) input of alphanumeric data into computers .   In normal usage , the keyboard is used as a text entry interface to type text and numbers into a word processor , text editor or other programs . In a modern computer , the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software . A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all key presses to the controlling software . Keyboards are also used for computer gaming , either with regular keyboards or by using keyboards with special gaming features , which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations . A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer , such as Windows ' Control-Alt-Delete combination , which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine .  A command-line interface is a type of user interface operated entirely through a keyboard , or another device doing the job of one .   History   While typewriters are the definitive ancestor of all key-based text entry devices , the computer keyboard as a device for electromechanical data entry and communication derives largely from the utility of two devices : teleprinters ( or teletypes ) and keypunches . It was through such devices that modern computer keyboards inherited their layouts .   As early as the 1870s , teleprinter-like devices were used to simultaneously type and transmit stock market text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to stock ticker machines to be immediately copied and displayed onto ticker tape . The teleprinter , in its more contemporary form , was developed from 1907 to 1910 by American mechanical engineer Charles Krum and his son Howard , with early contributions by electrical engineer Frank Pearne . Earlier models were developed separately by individuals such as Royal Earl House and Frederick G. Creed .   Earlier , Herman Hollerith developed the first keypunch devices , which soon evolved to include keys for text and number entry akin to normal typewriters by the 1930s .   The keyboard on the teleprinter played a strong role in point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication for most of the 20th century , while the keyboard on the keypunch device played a strong role in data entry and storage for just as long . The development of the earliest computers incorporated electric typewriter keyboards : the development of the ENIAC computer incorporated a keypunch device as both the input and paper-based output device , while the BINAC computer also made use of an electromechanically controlled typewriter for both data entry onto magnetic tape ( instead of paper ) and data output .   From the 1940s until the late 1960s , typewriters were the main means of data entry and output for computing , becoming integrated into what were known as computer terminals . Because of the limitations of terminals based upon printed text in comparison to the growth in data storage , processing and transmission , a general move toward video-based computer terminals was effected by the 1970s , starting with the Datapoint 3300 in 1967 .   The keyboard remained the primary , most integrated computer peripheral well into the era of personal computing until the introduction of the mouse as a consumer device in 1984 . By this time , text-only user interfaces with sparse graphics gave way to comparatively graphics-rich icons on screen . However , keyboards remain central to human-computer interaction to the present , even as mobile personal computing devices such as smartphones and tablets adapt the keyboard as an optional virtual , touchscreen-based means of data entry .   Keyboard types   One factor determining the size of a keyboard is the presence of duplicate keys , such as a"], [83, "Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles . It is related to bowls , boules and shuffleboard . Two teams , each with four players , take turns sliding heavy , polished granite stones , also called rocks , across the ice curling sheet towards the house , a circular target marked on the ice . Each team has eight stones . The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game ; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end , which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones . A game usually consists of eight or ten ends .   The curler can induce a curved path by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides , and the path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms who accompany it as it slides down the sheet , using the brooms to alter the state of the ice in front of the stone . A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation , and the skills of the curlers determine how close to the desired result the stone will achieve . This gives curling its nickname of `` chess on ice '' .   Origins and history   Curling was invented in medieval Scotland , with the first written reference to a contest using stones on ice coming from the records of Paisley Abbey , Renfrewshire , in February 1541 . Two paintings , `` Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap '' and `` The Hunters in the Snow '' ( both dated 1565 ) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder depict Flemish peasants curling—Scotland and the Low Countries had strong trading and cultural links during this period , which is also evident in the history of golf .   Evidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 uncovered ( along with another bearing the date 1551 ) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane , Scotland . Kilsyth Curling Club claims to be the first club in the world , having been formally constituted in 1716 ; it is still in existence today . Kilsyth also claims the oldest purpose-built curling pond in the world at Colzium , in the form of a low dam creating a shallow pool some 100 × 250 metres in size .   The word curling first appears in print in 1620 in Perth , Scotland , in the preface and the verses of a poem by Henry Adamson . The game was ( and still is , in Scotland and Scottish-settled regions like southern New Zealand ) also known as `` the roaring game '' because of the sound the stones make while traveling over the pebble ( droplets of water applied to the playing surface ) . The verbal noun curling is formed from the Scots ( and English ) verb curl , which describes the motion of the stone .   In the early history of curling , the playing stones were simply flat-bottomed river stones , which were of inconsistent size , shape and smoothness . Unlike today , the thrower had little control over the 'curl ' or velocity and relied more on luck than on precision , skill and strategy .   In Darvel , East Ayrshire , the weavers relaxed by playing curling matches using the heavy stone weights from the looms ' warp beams , fitted with a detachable handle for the purpose . Many a wife would keep her husband 's brass curling stone handle on the mantelpiece , brightly polished until the next time it was needed . Central Canadian curlers often used 'irons ' rather than stones until the early 1900s , Canada is the only country known to have done so , while others experimented with wood or ice-filled tins .   Outdoor curling was very popular in Scotland between the 16th and 19th centuries because the climate provided good ice conditions every winter . Scotland is home to the international governing body for curling , the World Curling Federation , Perth , which originated as a committee of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club , the mother club of curling .   Today , the game is most firmly established in Canada , having been taken there by Scottish emigrants . The Royal Montreal Curling Club , the oldest established sports club still active in North"], [84, "Philip II of Spain ( ; 21 May 1527 – 13 September 1598 ) , called `` the Prudent '' ( el Prudente ) , was King of Spain ( 1556–98 ) , King of Portugal ( 1581–98 , as Philip I , Filipe I ) , King of Naples and Sicily ( both from 1554 ) , and during his marriage to Queen Mary I ( 1554–58 ) King of England and Ireland . He was also Duke of Milan . From 1555 , he was lord of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands .   Known in Spain as `` Felipe el Prudente '' ( ' '' Philip the Prudent ' '' ) , his empire included territories on every continent then known to Europeans , including his namesake the Philippine Islands . During his reign , Spain reached the height of its influence and power . This is sometimes called the Golden Age . The expression , `` the empire on which the sun never sets , '' was coined during Philip 's time to reflect the extent of his dominion .   During Philip 's reign there were separate state bankruptcies in 1557 , 1560 , 1569 , 1575 , and 1596 . This was partly the cause for the declaration of independence which created the Dutch Republic in 1581 . A devout Catholic , Philip is also known for organising a huge naval expedition against Protestant England in 1588 , known usually as the Spanish Armada , which was unsuccessful , mostly due to storms and grave logistical problems .   Philip was described by the Venetian ambassador Paolo Fagolo in 1563 as `` slight of stature and round-faced , with pale blue eyes , somewhat prominent lip , and pink skin , but his overall appearance is very attractive . '' The Ambassador went on to say `` He dresses very tastefully , and everything that he does is courteous and gracious . ''   Early years : 1527–54   The son of Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire , and his wife , Infanta Isabella of Portugal , Philip was born in the Spanish capital of Valladolid on 21 May 1527 at Palacio de Pimentel owned by Don Bernardino Pimentel ( the first Marqués de Távara ) . The culture and courtly life of Spain were an important influence in his early life . He was tutored by Juan Martínez Siliceo – the future Archbishop of Toledo . Philip displayed reasonable aptitude in arms and letters alike . Later he would study with more illustrious tutors , including the humanist Juan Cristóbal Calvete de Estrella . Philip , though he had good command over Latin , Spanish and Portuguese , never managed to equal his father , Charles V , as a polyglot . Despite being also a German archduke from the House of Habsburg , Philip was seen as a foreigner in the Holy Roman Empire . The feeling was mutual . Philip felt himself to be culturally Spanish ; he had been born in Spain and raised in the Castilian court , his native tongue was Spanish , and he preferred to live in Spain . This would ultimately impede his succession to the imperial throne .   In April 1528 , when Philip was eleven months old , he received the oath of allegiance as heir to the crown from the Cortes of Castile , and from that time until the death of his mother Isabella in 1539 , Philip was raised in the royal court of Castile under the care of his mother , and one of her Portuguese ladies , Dona Leonor de Mascarenhas , to whom he was devotedly attached . Philip was also close to his two sisters , María and Juana , and to his two pages , the Portuguese nobleman Rui Gomes da Silva and Luis de Requesens , the son of his governor Juan de Zúñiga . These men would serve Philip throughout their lives , as would Antonio Pérez , his secretary from 1541 .   Philip 's martial training was undertaken by his governor , Juan de Zúñiga , a Castilian nobleman who served as the commendador mayor of Castile . The practical lessons in warfare was overseen by the Duke of Alba during the Italian Wars . Philip was present at the Siege of Perpignan in 1542 , but did not see action as the Spanish army under Alba decisively defeated the besieging French forces under the Dauphin of France . On his way back to Castile , Philip received the oath of allegiance of the Aragonese Cortes at Monzón . His political training had begun a year previously under his father"], [85, "An opera house is a theatre building used for opera performances that consists of a stage , an orchestra pit , audience seating , and backstage facilities for costumes and set building . While some venues are constructed specifically for operas , other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers .   History   The first public opera house came into existence in 1637 as the Teatro San Cassiano in Venice , Italy , in a country where opera has been popular through the centuries among ordinary people as well as wealthy patrons ; it still has a large number of working opera houses . In contrast , there was no opera house in London when Henry Purcell was composing and the first opera house in Germany was built in Hamburg in 1678 . Early United States opera houses served a variety of functions in towns and cities , hosting community dances , fairs , plays , and vaudeville shows as well as operas and other musical events .   In the 17th and 18th centuries , opera houses were often financed by rulers , nobles , and wealthy people who used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambitions and social positions or prestige . With the rise of bourgeois and capitalist social forms in the 19th century , European culture moved away from its patronage system to a publicly supported system . In the 2000s , most opera and theatre companies raise funds from a combination of government and institutional grants , ticket sales , and private donations .   Features     The Teatro San Carlo in Naples introduces the plant horseshoe , the oldest in the world , a model for the Italian theater . On this model were built following theaters of Italy and Europe , among others , the court theater of the Palace of Caserta , who will become the model for other theaters .  Given the popularity of opera in 18th and 19th century Europe , opera houses are usually large , with generally more than 1,000 seats and often several thousand . Traditionally , Europe 's major opera houses built in the 19th century contained between about 1,500 to 3,000 seats , examples being Brussels ' La Monnaie ( after renovations , with 1,700 seats ) , Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater ( with 1,636 ) , Warsaw 's Grand Theatre ( the main auditorium with 1,841 ) , Paris ' Opéra Garnier ( with 2,200 ) , the Royal Opera House in London ( with 2,268 ) and the Vienna State Opera ( the new auditorium with reduced capacity of 2,280 ) . Modern opera houses of the twentieth century such as New York 's Metropolitan Opera ( with 3,800 ) and the San Francisco Opera ( with 3,146 ) are larger . Many operas are better suited to being presented in smaller theatres , such as Venice 's La Fenice with about 1,000 seats .   In a traditional opera house , the auditorium is U-shaped , with the length of the sides determining the audience capacity . Around this are tiers of balconies , and often , nearer to the stage , are boxes ( small partitioned sections of a balcony ) .   Since the latter part of the nineteenth century , opera houses generally have an orchestra pit , where a large number of orchestra players may be seated at a level below the audience , so that they can play without overwhelming the singing voices . This is especially true of Wagner 's Bayreuth Festspielhaus where the pit is almost completely covered .   The size of an opera orchestra varies , but for some operas , oratorios and other works , it may be very large ; for some romantic period works ( or for many of the operas of Richard Strauss ) , it can be well over 100 players . Similarly , an opera may have a large cast of characters , chorus , dancers and supernumeraries . Therefore , a major opera house will have extensive dressing room facilities . Opera houses often have on-premises set and costume building shops and facilities for storage of costumes , make-up , masks , and stage properties , and may also have rehearsal spaces .   Major opera houses throughout the world often have highly mechanized stages , with large stage elevators permitting heavy sets to be changed rapidly . At the Metropolitan Opera , for instance , sets are often changed during the action , as the audience watches , with singers rising or descending as they sing . This occurs in the Met 's productions of operas such"], [86, "Archer is an American adult animated spy comedy television series , created by Adam Reed for the FX network . The pilot episode of the series aired as a sneak peek on September 17 , 2009 , before the show made its official debut on January 14 , 2010 . On June 21 , 2016 , FX renewed the series for an eighth , ninth , and tenth season , each to consist of eight episodes . It was announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 that Season 8 will premiere in January 2017 , but the series is moving to FX ’ s sister network , FXX .   Premise   Originally working for the `` International Secret Intelligence Service '' ( ISIS ) in New York City , suave , profoundly self-centered master spy Sterling Archer deals with global espionage , as well as his domineering , emotionally-distant mother and boss Malory Archer , fellow ISIS agent and ex-girlfriend Lana Kane , and ISIS employees Ray Gillette , Cyril Figgis , Pam Poovey , Cheryl Tunt , and Dr. Algernop Krieger .   A season-long arc took place in the fifth season , re-configuring the show from a spy series to a Miami Vice-style satire of the drug industry . To reflect this , the season was titled Archer Vice . When ISIS is disbanded by the U.S. government , its employees take a stockpile of cocaine that they acquired from previous operations and form a drug cartel to fund their retirements . Meanwhile , Cheryl decides to launch a new career as a country singer .   In the sixth season , the series returned to the spy format , and essentially `` unrebooted '' the characters back to their personalities before the fifth season . However , some elements from the fifth season had a big impact on the series going forward , including new character introductions ( Lana Kane giving birth to her daughter , and Christian Slater playing a fictional version of himself ) , and the revelation of the CIA 's involvement in some of the events that happened during Archer Vice . The characters now started working as contractors for the CIA .   The seventh season once again retooled the show , after the characters were fired from the CIA and blacklisted from espionage in the sixth season finale following failure during a mission . They move to Los Angeles , California to start their own private detective agency , known as The Figgis Agency ( named after character Cyril Figgis ) . The show once again took on a serialized , season-long story arc .   Time period   The show 's time setting is comically anachronistic , deliberately mixing technologies , clothing styles and historical backdrops of different decades . The characters wear 1960s clothing and hairstyles , and many episodes feature references to the Soviet Union as a current nation , yet in the fourth-season episode `` Once Bitten '' , Turkmenistan is an independent nation rather than a Soviet republic . It also contains references to Fidel Castro as the current leader of Cuba . The show frequently uses pop-culture references which are contemporary to the 2010s , yet character backstories place them at older events — such as Woodhouse 's service in World War I , or Malory 's involvement in various espionage events of World War II and the Cold War era — which would require them to be much older than they are if the show were actually set in the 21st century .   The technological sophistication within the series also varies , with characters using dated computer technology ( e.g . reel-to-reel mainframe systems , desktop computers closely resembling the Macintosh XL , dot-matrix printers , and punch cards ) and making surveillance recordings on cassette tape rather than digitally , but also using modern technologies such as GPS devices , the Internet , laser gunsights , cryptocurrencies , USB flash drives and cellular phones ( season 6 saw the appearance of touchscreen devices and flip phones ) . This ambiguity is explicitly recognized in at least two episodes , in which characters are unable to answer when asked what year they think it is .   Episodes   Archer officially premiered on FX on January 14 , 2010 . The show 's seventh season , which premiered on March 31 , 2016 , was originally announced to contain 13 episodes , but creator Adam Reed later stated in an interview that the season would be a `` 10-episode story '' . Before season 7 premiered , the show was announced to be moved to sister network FXX to be paired with a"], [87, "The United Kingdom is a unitary governed within the framework of a constitutional monarchy , in which the Monarch is the head of state and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of government . Executive power is exercised by Her Majesty 's Government , on behalf of and by the consent of the Monarch , as well as by the devolved Governments of Scotland and Wales , and the Northern Ireland Executive . Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom , the House of Commons and the House of Lords , as well as in the Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies . The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature . The highest court is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom .   The UK political system is a multi-party system . Since the 1920s , the two largest political participation have been the Conservative Party and the Labour Party . Before the Labour Party rose in British politics , the Liberal Party was the other major political party along with the Conservatives . Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of parliamentary politics , the first-past-the-post electoral system used for general elections tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties , though each has in the past century relied upon a third party such as the Liberal Democrats to deliver a working majority in Parliament . A Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government held office from 2010 until 2015 , the first coalition since 1945 . The coalition ended following Parliamentary elections on May 7 , 2015 , in which the Conservative Party won an outright majority of 330 seats in the House of Commons , while their coalition partners lost all but eight seats .   With the partition of Ireland , Northern Ireland received home rule in 1920 , though civil unrest meant direct rule was restored in 1972 . Support for nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales led to proposals for devolution in the 1970s though only in the 1990s did devolution actually happen . Today , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland each possess a legislature and executive , with devolution in Northern Ireland being conditional on participation in certain all-Ireland institutions . The United Kingdom remains responsible for non-devolved matters and , in the case of Northern Ireland , co-operates with the Republic of Ireland .   It is a matter of dispute as to whether increased autonomy and devolution of executive and legislative powers has contributed to the increase in support for independence . The principal pro-independence party , the Scottish National Party , became a minority government in 2007 and then went on to win an overall majority of MSPs at the 2011 Scottish parliament elections and forms the Scottish Government administration . A 2014 referendum on independence led to a rejection of the proposal , but with 45 % voting to secede . In Northern Ireland , the largest Pro-Belfast Agreement party , Sinn Féin , not only advocates Northern Ireland 's unification with the Republic of Ireland , but also abstains from taking their elected seats in the Westminster government , as this would entail taking a pledge of allegiance to the British monarch .   The constitution of the United Kingdom is uncodified , being made up of constitutional conventions , statutes and other elements such as EU law . This system of government , known as the Westminster system , has been adopted by other countries , especially those that were formerly parts of the British Empire .   The United Kingdom is also responsible for several dependencies , which fall into two categories : the Crown dependencies , in the immediate vicinity of the UK , and British Overseas Territories , which originated as colonies of the British Empire .   History   The Crown   The British Monarch , currently Queen Elizabeth II , is the Chief of State of the United Kingdom . Though she takes little direct part in government , the Crown remains the fount in which ultimate executive power over Government lies . These powers are known as Royal Prerogative and can be used for a vast amount of things , such as the issue or withdrawal of passports , to the dismissal of the Prime Minister or even the Declaration of War . The powers are delegated from the Monarch personally , in the name of the Crown , and can be handed to various ministers , or other Officers of the Crown , and can purposely bypass the consent of Parliament .   The head of Her Majesty 's Government ;"], [88, "The 100 metres , or 100-meter dash , is a sprint race in track and field competitions . The shortest common outdoor running distance , it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics . It has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women .   The reigning 100 m Olympic champion is often named `` the fastest runner in the world . '' The World Championships 100 metres has been contested since 1983 . Jamaicans Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce are the reigning world and Olympic champions in the men 's and women 's 100 metres , respectively .   On an outdoor 400 metres running track , the 100 m is run on the home straight , with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race . Runners begin in the starting blocks and the race begins when an official fires the starter 's pistol . Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50–60 m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line .   The 10-second barrier has historically been a barometer of fast men 's performances , while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race . The current men 's world record is 9.58 seconds , set by Jamaica 's Usain Bolt in 2009 , while the women 's world record of 10.49 seconds set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 remains unbroken .   The 100 m ( 109.361 yards ) emerged from the metrication of the 100 yards ( 91.44 m ) , a now defunct distance originally contested in English-speaking countries . The event is largely held outdoors as few indoor facilities have a 100 m straight .   US athletes have won the men 's Olympic 100 metres title more times than any other country , 17 out of the 27 times that it has been run .   Race dynamics   Start   At the start , some athletes play psychological games such as trying to be last to the starting blocks .   At high level meets , the time between the gun and first kick against the starting block is measured electronically , via sensors built in the gun and the blocks . A reaction time less than 0.1 s is considered a false start . The 0.2-second interval accounts for the sum of the time it takes for the sound of the starter 's pistol to reach the runners ' ears , and the time they take to react to it .   For many years a sprinter was disqualified if responsible for two false starts individually . However , this rule allowed some major races to be restarted so many times that the sprinters started to lose focus . The next iteration of the rule , introduced in February 2003 , meant that one false start was allowed among the field , but anyone responsible for a subsequent false start was disqualified .   This rule led to some sprinters deliberately false-starting to gain a psychological advantage : an individual with a slower reaction time might false-start , forcing the faster starters to wait and be sure of hearing the gun for the subsequent start , thereby losing some of their advantage . To avoid such abuse and to improve spectator enjoyment , the IAAF implemented a further change in the 2010 season – a false starting athlete now receives immediate disqualification . This proposal was met with objections when first raised in 2005 , on the grounds that it would not leave any room for innocent mistakes . Justin Gatlin commented , `` Just a flinch or a leg cramp could cost you a year 's worth of work . '' The rule had a dramatic impact at the 2011 World Championships , when current world record holder Usain Bolt was disqualified .   Mid-race   Runners normally reach their top speed just past the halfway point of the race and they progressively decelerate in the later stages of the race . Maintaining that top speed for as long as possible is a primary focus of training for the 100 m. Pacing and running tactics do not play a significant role in the 100 m , as success in the event depends more on pure athletic qualities and technique .   Finish   The winner , by IAAF Competition Rules , is determined by the first athlete with his or her torso ( not including limbs , head , or neck ) over the nearer edge of the finish line . When the placing"], [89, "Aloysius Paulus Maria `` Louis '' van Gaal , OON ( ; born 8 August 1951 ) , is a Dutch football manager and former player . He was formerly manager of Ajax , Barcelona , AZ , Bayern Munich , the Netherlands and Manchester United . He is one of the most decorated managers in world football .   Before his career as a coach , Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Royal Antwerp , Telstar , Sparta Rotterdam , Ajax and AZ . He is also a fully qualified physical education teacher and has worked as such at high schools during various stages of his career as a semi-professional footballer .   After a brief spell as coach at AZ , Van Gaal served as assistant coach under Leo Beenhakker at Ajax and eventually took over as head coach in 1991 . Under his lead , the club won three Eredivisie titles , the UEFA Cup , and the Champions League . He moved to Barcelona in 1997 and won two Spanish league titles and one Copa del Rey . After some disagreements at Barcelona , he was appointed coach of the Netherlands national team , but failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup . Another brief spell at Barcelona followed before he became manager of AZ . After winning the Eredivisie with AZ in 2008–09 , he was hired by Bayern Munich on 1 July 2009 . In his first season at Bayern , he secured the Bundesliga title , won the DFB-Pokal , and reached the final of the Champions League . In July 2012 , he was appointed manager of the Netherlands for the second time and led them to third place at the 2014 FIFA World Cup , before leaving for Manchester United . He had a satisfactory first season . However , after only finishing fifth in his second season he was sacked and replaced by José Mourinho , despite winning the FA Cup .   Playing and early coaching career   Van Gaal was born in Amsterdam . As a youngster , he started playing for the Amsterdam amateur side RKSV 'De Meer ' . At the age of 20 , he joined the second team of Ajax , but was never chosen to play in the first team , which at the time boasted players such as Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens in the midfield positions . He was loaned to Belgian First Division side Royal Antwerp playing under Guy Thys with whom he was runner-up in the Belgian top division in 1974 and 1975 . After four years spent in Belgium , he returned to his homeland and made his Eredivisie debut for Telstar under the guidance of manager , Mircea Petescu , whom he followed to Sparta Rotterdam . He later joined AZ , where he also became assistant coach in 1986 . After a short career at AZ , he returned to Ajax to become Leo Beenhakker 's assistant . When Beenhakker left in 1991 , Van Gaal took over as manager .   Management career   Ajax ( 1991–1997 )   Van Gaal was Ajax manager from 1991 until 1997 and had a very successful tenure . Under Van Gaal , Ajax became the Eredivisie champions three times , in 1994 , 1995 ( notably going the entire 1994–95 season unbeaten in both the league and the Champions League ) and 1996 . He also led Ajax to the KNVB Cup in 1993 and the Johan Cruijff Shield in 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 . On the European scene , Ajax captured the UEFA Cup in 1992 and the UEFA Champions League in 1995 after beating Milan in the final . The latter win was followed by a 5–1 aggregate win over Real Zaragoza in the 1995 UEFA Super Cup . Late in 1995 , Ajax beat Brazilian side Grêmio on penalties to win the Toyota Cup ( formerly Intercontinental Cup ) . Ajax were also Champions League runners-up in 1996 after losing to Juventus on penalties .   Ajax was so successful under Van Gaal 's leadership that during the 1990s , the Dutch national team was dominated by Ajax players such as Patrick Kluivert , Marc Overmars , Dennis Bergkamp , Frank and Ronald de Boer , Edgar Davids , Clarence Seedorf , Winston Bogarde , Michael Reiziger , and Edwin van der Sar .   After serving out his contract at Ajax ( 1997 ) , Van Gaal received his knighthood in the Order of Orange-Nassau .   Barcelona ( 1997–2000 )   Van Gaal moved to Barcelona in 1997 , taking over from Bobby Robson , and helped the"], [90, "Jahangir Khan , HI , ( ) born 10 December 1963 in Karachi , Pakistan ( sometimes spelled `` Jehangir Khan '' ) is a former World No . 1 professional squash player from Pakistan , who is considered to be the greatest player in the history of squash . Jahangir Khan is originally from Neway Kelay Payan , Peshawar . During his career he won the World Open six times and the British Open a record ten times . From 1981 to 1986 , he was unbeaten in competitive play . During that time he won 555 matches consecutively , the longest winning streak by any athlete in top-level professional sports as recorded by Guinness World Records . He retired as a player in 1993 , and has served as President of the World Squash Federation from 2002 to 2008 , when he became Emeritus President .   Playing career   Jahangir was coached initially by his father , Roshan , the 1957 British Open champion , then by his late brother Torsam . After his brother 's sudden death he was coached by his cousin Rehmat Khan , who guided Jahangir through most of his career . Jahangir was physically very weak as a child . Though the doctors had advised him not to take part in any sort of physical activity , after undergoing a couple of hernia operations his father let him play and try out their family game .   In 1979 , the Pakistan selectors decided not to select Jahangir to play in the world championships in Australia , judging him too weak from a recent illness . Jahangir decided instead to enter the World Amateur Individual Championship and , at the age of 15 , became the youngest-ever winner of that event .   In November 1979 , Jahangir 's older brother Torsam , who had been one of the leading international squash players in the 1970s , died suddenly of a heart attack during a tournament match in Australia . Torsam 's death profoundly affected Jahangir . He considered quitting the game , but decided to pursue a career in the sport as a tribute to his brother .   Notable achievements   * Won World Amateur Championships at age 15  * Youngest ever World Open Champion ( aged 17 )  * Unbeaten in 555 consecutive matches over 5 years and 8 months  * Won the British Open Championship 10 times in succession ( 1982-1993 )  * Six-times World Open Champion  * First player to win World Open Championships without dropping a game  * Played the second longest match in the squash history 2.46 h   Five-year unbeaten run   In 1981 , when he was 17 , Jahangir became the youngest winner of the World Open , beating Australia 's Geoff Hunt ( the game 's dominant player in the late-1970s ) in the final . That tournament marked the start of an unbeaten run which lasted for five years and 555 matches . The hallmark of his play was his incredible fitness and stamina , which Rehmat Khan helped him build up through a punishing training and conditioning regime . Jahangir was quite simply the fittest player in the game , and would wear his opponents down through long rallies played at a furious pace .   In 1982 , Jahangir astonished everyone by winning the International Squash Players Association Championship without losing a single point .   The unbeaten run finally came to end in the final of the World Open in 1986 in Toulouse , France , when Jahangir lost to New Zealand 's Ross Norman . Norman had been in pursuit of Jahangir 's unbeaten streak , being beaten time and time again . `` One day Jahangir will be slightly off his game and I will get him '' , he vowed for five years .   Speaking about his unbeaten streak , Jahangir said : `` It was n't my plan to create such a record . All I did was put in the effort to win every match I played and it went on for weeks , months and years until my defeat to Ross Norman in Toulouse in 1986 . ''   `` The pressure began to mount as I kept winning every time and people were anxious to see if I could be beaten . In that World Open final , Ross got me . It was exactly five years and eight months . I was unbeaten for another nine months after that defeat .

Announcement   The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on 12 October 2007 . It stated that responses to indications of future climate changes must follow the precautionary principle , and that extensive changes would damage living standards , leading to likelihood of wars and violent conflicts . It paid tribute to the work of the IPCC :   It said that `` Al Gore has for a long time been one of the world ’ s leading environmentalist politicians '' , and described him as `` probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted . '' In conclusion , it said the Nobel Committee was `` seeking to contribute to a sharper focus on the processes and decisions that appear to be necessary to protect the world ’ s future climate , and thereby to reduce the threat to the security of mankind . Action is necessary now , before climate change moves beyond man ’ s control . ''   The award was given immediate publicity : an Associated Press article published by USA Today on 12 October 2007 and headlined `` Gore , scientists share Nobel Peace Prize '' quoted Pachauri as saying `` All the scientists that have contributed to the work of the IPCC are the Nobel laureates who have been recognized and acknowledged by the Nobel Prize Committee '' . He added that `` they should feel deeply encouraged and inspired . It is their contribution which has been recognized '' , and said `` I only happen to be a functionary that essentially oversees the process . '' On the same day , the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory listed its scientists who had contributed to the IPCC 's work , and said that Pachauri had sent a letter to lead authors of the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report saying that he had `` been stunned in a pleasant way with the news of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for the IPCC . This makes each of you a Nobel Laureate and it is my privilege to acknowledge this honour on your behalf '' . The letter went on to say that `` The fact that the IPCC has earned the recognition that this award embodies , is really a tribute to your knowledge , hard work and application . ''   Presentation   In Oslo on 10 December 2007 , the presentation was made with a speech by Ole Danbolt Mjøs as Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee , and followed by Nobel Lectures given by Rajendra K. Pachauri , representing the IPCC , and Al Gore . In his lecture , Pachauri thanked those contributing to the IPCC :   IPCC certificates   The IPCC presented scientists who had `` contributed substantially to the preparation of IPCC reports '' with personalized certificates for `` contributing to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 to the IPCC '' . The certificates , which name the individual and feature a reproduction of the Nobel Peace Prize diploma , were sent to `` coordinating lead authors , lead authors , review editors , Bureau members , staff of the technical support units and staff of the secretariat from the IPCC ’ s inception in 1988 until the award of the prize in 2007 . ''   In a statement of 29 October 2012 the IPCC clarified that the `` prize was awarded to the IPCC as an organisation , and not to any individual involved with the IPCC . Thus it is incorrect to refer to any IPCC official , or scientist who worked on IPCC reports , as a Nobel laureate or Nobel Prize winner . It would be correct to describe a scientist who was involved with AR4 or earlier IPCC reports in this way : ' X contributed to the reports of the IPCC , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 . ' '' It stated that it had not sent the certificates to `` contributing authors , expert reviewers and focal points .

As the richest Brazilian state and a major industrial complex , often dubbed the `` locomotive of Brazil '' , the state alone is responsible for a third of Brazilian GDP . São Paulo also has the second highest Human Development Index ( HDI ) and GDP per capita , the fourth lowest infant mortality rate and the third lowest rate of illiteracy among the federative units of Brazil . If it were an independent country , its nominal GDP would be ranked among the top 20 in the world ( 2010 estimate ) .   With more than 45 millions inhabitants in 2014 , São Paulo is the most populous Brazilian state , the most populous national subdivision in the Americas , and the third most populous political unit of South America , surpassed only by the rest of the Brazilian Federation and Colombia . The local population is one of the most diverse in the country and descended mostly from Italians , who began immigrating to the country in the late 19th century ; of the Portuguese , who colonized Brazil and installed the first European settlements in the region ; indigenous peoples , a large number of distinct ethnic groups ; African peoples , who were brought from Africa in colonial era to be enslaved ; and migrants from other regions of the country . Other major immigration flows , as Arabs , Germans , Spanish , Japanese and Chinese , also had a significant presence in the ethnic composition of the local population .   The area that today corresponds to the state territory was already inhabited by indigenous peoples from approximately 12,000 BC . In the early 16th century , the coast of the region began to be visited by Portuguese and Spanish navigators . However , only in 1532 Martim Afonso de Sousa would establish the first Portuguese permanent settlement in the Americas - the village of São Vicente , in the Baixada Santista . In the 17th century , the paulistas bandeirantes intensified the exploration of the interior of the colony , which eventually expand the territorial domain of the Portuguese Empire in South America . In the 18th century , after the establishment of the Province of São Paulo , the region begins to gain political weight . After independence , during the Empire of Brazil , São Paulo begins to become a major agricultural producer ( mainly coffee ) , which ultimately create a rich regional rural oligarchy , which would switch on the command of the Brazilian government with the Minas Gerais 's elites during the early republican period . Under the Vargas Era , the state was one of the first to initiate a process of industrialization and its population becomes one of the most urban of the federation .   The city of São Paulo , the homonymous state capital , is ranked as the 12th largest city on the planet and its metropolitan area , with 20 millions inhabitants , is the 9th largest in the world and second in the Americas , after Greater Mexico City . Regions near the city of São Paulo are also metropolitan areas , such as Campinas , Santos , Sorocaba and São José dos Campos . The total population of these areas coupled with the capital – the so-called Expanded Metropolitan Complex – exceeds 30 million inhabitants , i.e . approximately 75 % of the population of São Paulo statewide , the first macro-metropolis in the southern hemisphere , joining 65 municipalities that together are home to 12 % of the Brazilian population .   History   Early period   In pre-European times , the area that is now São Paulo state was occupied by the Tupi people 's nation , who subsisted through hunting and cultivation . The first European to settle in the area was João Ramalho , a Portuguese sailor who may have been shipwrecked around 1510 , ten years after the first Portuguese landfall in Brazil . He married the daughter of a local chieftain and became a settler . In 1532 , the first colonial expedition , led by Martim Afonso de Sousa of Portugal , landed at São Vicente ( near the present-day port at Santos ) . De Sousa added Ramalho 's settlement to his colony .   Early European colonisation of Brazil was very limited . Portugal was more interested in Africa and Asia . But with English and French privateer ships just off the coast , the territory had to be protected . Unwilling to shoulder the burden of defence himself"], [93, "Clark Gable ( February 1 , 1901 – November 16 , 1960 ) was an American film actor , often referred to as `` The King of Hollywood '' or just simply as `` The King '' . Gable began his career as a stage actor and appeared as an extra in silent films between 1924 and 1926 , and progressed to supporting roles with a few films for MGM in 1931 . The next year , he landed his first leading Hollywood role and became a leading man in more than 60 motion pictures over the next three decades .   Gable won an Academy Award for Best Actor for It Happened One Night ( 1934 ) , and was nominated for leading roles in Mutiny on the Bounty ( 1935 ) and for his arguably best-known role as Rhett Butler in the epic Gone with the Wind ( 1939 ) .   Gable also found success commercially and critically with films such as Red Dust ( 1932 ) , Manhattan Melodrama ( 1934 ) , San Francisco ( 1936 ) , Saratoga ( 1937 ) Boom Town ( 1940 ) , The Hucksters ( 1947 ) Homecoming ( 1948 ) , and The Misfits ( 1961 ) , which was his final screen appearance .   Gable appeared opposite some of the most popular actresses of the time : Joan Crawford , who was his favorite actress with whom to work , was partnered with Gable in eight films , Myrna Loy worked with him seven times , and he was paired with Jean Harlow in six productions . He also starred with Lana Turner in four features , and with Norma Shearer and Ava Gardner in three each . Gable 's final film , The Misfits ( 1961 ) , united him with Marilyn Monroe ( also in her last screen appearance ) . Gable is considered one of the most consistent box-office performers in history , appearing on Quigley Publishing 's annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll 16 times . He was named the seventh-greatest male star of classic American cinema by the American Film Institute .   Life and career   Early life   William Clark Gable was born in Cadiz , Ohio , to William Henry `` Will '' Gable ( 1870–1948 ) , an oil-well driller , and his wife , Adeline ( née Hershelman ; 1869–1901 ) . Gable was named William after his father , but even in childhood , he was almost always called Clark . He was mistakenly listed as a female on his birth certificate . Among Gable 's ancestors were Pennsylvania Dutch ( German ) , Rhinelanders , and Bavarians . When he was six months old , his mother had him baptized as a Roman Catholic . She died when he was ten months old , possibly from a brain tumor . Will Gable refused to raise his son Catholic , provoking criticism from Adeline 's side of the family . The dispute was resolved when Will Gable agreed to allow his son to spend time with his maternal uncle , Charles Hershelman , and his wife on their farm in Vernon Township , Pennsylvania .   In April 1903 , Gable 's father married Jennie Dunlap ( 1874–1924 ) , whose family came from the small neighboring town of Hopedale . The marriage produced no children . Gable was a tall , shy child with a loud voice . His stepmother raised him to be well-dressed and well-groomed . Jennie played the piano and gave her stepson lessons at home . Later he took up brass instruments . At 13 , he was the only boy in the men 's town band . He was very mechanically inclined and loved to strip down and repair cars with his father . Though his father insisted on Gable doing `` manly '' things , like hunting and hard physical work , Gable loved language . Among trusted company , he would recite Shakespeare , particularly the sonnets . Will Gable agreed to buy a 72-volume set of The World 's Greatest Literature to improve his son 's education , but claimed he never saw his son use it . In 1917 , when Gable was in high school , his father had financial difficulties . Will decided to settle his debts and try his hand at farming , and the family moved to Ravenna , Ohio , near Akron . Despite his father 's insistence that he work the farm , Gable soon left to work in Akron 's B.F. Goodrich tire factory .   Early career   At 17 , Clark Gable was inspired to be"], [94, "The Muscovy duck ( Cairina moschata ) is a large duck native to Mexico , Central , and South America . Small wild and feral breeding populations have established themselves in the United States , particularly in Florida and the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas as well as in many other parts of North America , including southern Canada . Feral Muscovy ducks are found in New Zealand , Australia , and in parts of Europe .   They are large ducks , with the males about 76 cm long , and weighing up to 7 kg . Females are considerably smaller , and only grow to 3 kg , roughly half the males ' size . The bird is predominantly black and white , with the back feathers being iridescent and glossy in males , while the females are more drab . The amount of white on the neck and head is variable , as well as the bill , which can be yellow , pink , black , or any mixture of these . They may have white patches or bars on the wings , which become more noticeable during flight . Both sexes have pink or red wattles around the bill , those of the male being larger and more brightly colored .   Although the Muscovy duck is a tropical bird , it adapts well to cooler climates , thriving in weather as cold as and able to survive even colder conditions . In general , Barbary duck is the term used for C. moschata in a culinary context .   The domestic breed , Cairina moschata forma domestica , is commonly known in Spanish as the pato criollo ( `` creole duck '' ) . They have been bred since pre-Columbian times by Native Americans and are heavier and less able to fly long distances than the wild subspecies . Their plumage color is also more variable . Other names for the domestic breed in Spanish are pato casero ( `` backyard duck '' ) and pato mudo ( `` mute duck '' ) .   Description   All Muscovy ducks have long claws on their feet and a wide flat tail . In the domestic drake ( male ) , length is about 86 cm and weight is , while the domestic hen ( female ) is much smaller , at 64 cm in length and in weight . Large domesticated males often weigh up to 8 kg , and large domesticated females up to 5 kg .   The true wild Muscovy duck , from which all domesticated Muscovys originated , is blackish , with large white wing patches . Length can range from 66 to , wingspan from 137 to and weight from in wild Muscovys . On the head , the wild male has short crest on the nape . The bill is black with a speckling of pale pink . A blackish or dark red knob can be seen at the bill base , and the bare skin of the face is similar to that in color . The eyes are yellowish-brown . The legs and webbed feet are blackish . The wild female is similar in plumage , but is also much smaller , and she has feathered face and lacks the prominent knob . The juvenile is duller overall , with little or no white on the upperwing . Domesticated birds may look similar ; most are dark brown or black mixed with white , particularly on the head . Other colors such as lavender or all-white are also seen . Both sexes have a nude black-and-red or all-red face ; the drake also has pronounced caruncles at the base of the bill and a low erectile crest of feathers .   C. moschata ducklings are mostly yellow with buff-brown markings on the tail and wings . Some domesticated ducklings have a dark head and blue eyes , others a light brown crown and dark markings on their nape . They are agile and speedy precocial birds .   The drake has a low breathy call , and the hen a quiet trilling coo .   The karyotype of the Muscovy duck is 2n=80 , consisting of three pairs of macrochromosomes , 36 pairs of microchromosomes , and a pair of sex chromosomes . The two largest macrochromosome pairs are submetacentric , while all other chromosomes are acrocentric or ( for the smallest microchromosomes ) probably telocentric . The submetacentric chromosomes and the Z ( female ) chromosome show rather little constitutive heterochromatin ( C bands ) , while the W chromosomes are at least two-thirds heterochromatin .   Male Muscovy ducks have spiralled penises which can"], [95, "Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis . It can occur in four forms : skin , inhalation , intestinal , and injection . Symptoms begin between one day and two months after contracting the infection . The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless ulcer with a black center . The inhalation form presents with fever , chest pain , and shortness of breath . The intestinal form presents with nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or abdominal pain . The injection form presents with fever and an abscess at the site of drug injection .   Anthrax is spread by contact with the spores of the bacteria , which are often from infectious animal products . Contact is by breathing , eating , or through an area of broken skin . It does not typically spread directly between people . Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products , travelers , postal workers , and military personnel . Diagnosis can be confirmed based on finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by culture of a sample from the infected site .   The anthrax vaccine is recommended for people who are at high risk . Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred . Two months of antibiotics , such as doxycycline or ciprofloxacin , after exposure can also prevent infection . If infection occurs treatment is with antibiotics and possibly antitoxin . The type and number of antibiotics used depends on the type of infection . Antitoxin is recommended for those with widespread infection .   Anthrax among people is most common in Africa and central and southern Asia . It also occurs fairly regularly in southern Europe , but is uncommon in northern Europe and North America . Globally , at least 2,000 cases occur a year , with about two cases a year in the United States . Skin infections represent more than 95 % of cases . Without treatment the risk of death from skin anthrax is 24 % . For intestinal infection the risk of death is 25 % to 75 % while in inhaled anthrax despite treatment it is around 50 % to 80 % . Until the 20th century , anthrax infections killed hundreds of thousands of people and other animals each year . Anthrax has been developed as a weapon by a number of countries . In plant eating animals infection occurs when they eat or breathe in the spores while grazing . Carnivores may become infected by eating infected animals .   Signs and symptoms   Skin   Cutaneous anthrax , also known as Hide porter 's disease , is when anthrax occurs on the skin . It presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center ( eschar ) . The black eschar often shows up as a large , painless necrotic ulcer ( beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot , somewhat resembling bread mold ) at the site of infection . In general , cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure . Unlike bruises or most other lesions , cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain .   Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when B. anthracis spores enter through cuts on the skin . This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products .   Cutaneous anthrax is rarely fatal if treated , because the infection area is limited to the skin , preventing the lethal factor , edema factor , and protective antigen from entering and destroying a vital organ . Without treatment , about 20 % of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death .   Lungs   Respiratory infection in humans is relatively rare and initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days , followed by pneumonia and severe ( and often fatal ) respiratory collapse . Historical mortality rates were over 85 % , but , when treated early ( seen in the 2001 anthrax attacks ) , observed case fatality rate dropped to 45 % . Distinguishing pulmonary anthrax from more common causes of respiratory illness is essential to avoiding delays in diagnosis and thereby improving outcomes . An algorithm for this purpose has been developed .   Gastrointestinal   Gastrointestinal ( GI ) infection in humans is most often caused by consuming anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious GI difficulty , vomiting of blood , severe diarrhea"], [96, "The Hunter Valley is one of Australia 's best known wine regions . Located in the state of New South Wales , the region has played a pivotal role in the history of Australian wine as one of the first wine regions planted in the early 19th century . Hunter Valley Semillon is widely considered the iconic wine of the region but the Hunter produces wine from a variety of grapes including Shiraz , Chardonnay , Cabernet Sauvignon and Verdelho .   Under Australia 's wine appellation system , the Hunter Valley zone Australian Geographical Indication ( GI ) covers the entire catchment of the Hunter River and its tributaries . Within that , the Hunter region is almost as large , and includes most of the wine-producing areas , excluding the metropolitan area of Newcastle and nearby coastal areas , some national parks , and any land that was in the Mudgee Shire ( at the western heights of the catchment ) . There are three named subregions in the Hunter region . These are the Upper Hunter Valley , Broke Fordwich and Pokolbin subregions . The Lower Hunter Valley is not strictly defined , but in general includes the Pokolbin subregion , along with the districts around Wollombi , Mount View , Cessnock and Lovedale . Much of the history of Hunter was played out in this area and it is generally what is referred as the Hunter Valley wine country . The majority of the Hunter Valley 's most prestigious vineyards are located on the southern valley and foothills of the Brokenback Range ( part of the Great Dividing Range ) . The topography of the Hunter includes mostly gently sloping hills with modest gradients . The one notable exception are the vineyards of Mount View just west of the town of Cessnock . The terrain of the Upper Hunter is noticeably flatter as the Goulburn River and other tributaries of the Hunter River dominate the area .   Despite being the area 's namesake , the Hunter River itself is not the dominant feature of the region—falling behind the Brokenback Range for that distinction . The greater river system of the Hunter , which includes the Goulburn and important tributaries such as Giants Creek , do provide needed irrigation for areas such as the Upper Hunter than can be prone to drought condition . The origins of the river begin the Liverpool Range of the volcanic Barrington Tops and flows south and then east down to the Pacific Ocean at the seaport city of Newcastle .   The success of the Hunter Valley wine industry has been dominated by its proximity to Sydney with its settlement and plantings in the 19th century fuelled by the trade network that linked the valley to the city . The steady demand of consumers from Sydney continues to drive much of the Hunter Valley wine industry , including a factor in the economy by the tourism industry .   History   Over 30,000 years ago the Wonnarua tribe of aboriginal Australians inhabited the land that is now known as the Hunter Valley wine region . Along with the Worimi tribe to the north and the Awabakal to the south , the Wonnarua developed a trading route connecting the Coquun ( Hunter ) Valley to the harbour now known as Sydney harbour .   The wine-making history of Hunter Valley begins with the European settlement of the Sydney and the New South Wales region of Australia in the late 18th century as a penal colony of the British Empire . The Hunter River itself was discovered , by accident , in 1797 by British Lieutenant John Shortland as he searched for escaped convicts . The region soon became a valuable source for timber and coal that fuelled the steamship trade coming out of Sydney .   Grapevines were planted in Sydney soon after its discovery in 1788 and as settlements fanned northward up towards the Hunter , government authorities actively encouraged plantings as a means of promoting both public sobriety and safety . The logic behind the promotion of viticulture and winemaking was that men tend to become more drunk and disorderly when under the influence of highly alcoholic spirits . If enough wine was provided , it was believed , it could be a moderate influence that could tame the `` savagery '' .   It was under these auspices that the grapevine followed land prospector John Howe as he cut a path through the Australian wilderness from Sydney up to the overland area in what is now known as the ( Lower ) Hunter Valley proper in 1820 . Today , the modern Putty Road between the cities of Windsor and"], [97, "The Winter Olympic Games ( French : Jeux olympiques d'hiver ) is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years . Unlike the Summer Olympics , the Winter Olympics feature sports practiced on snow and ice . The first Winter Olympics , the 1924 Winter Olympics , was held in Chamonix , France . The original five sports ( broken into nine disciplines ) were bobsleigh , curling , ice hockey , Nordic skiing ( consisting of the disciplines military patrol , cross-country skiing , Nordic combined , and ski jumping ) , and skating ( consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating ) . The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936 , after which they were interrupted by World War II . The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years . Until 1992 , the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years , but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years , the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994 .   The Winter Games have evolved since its inception . Sports and disciplines have been added and some of them , such as Alpine skiing , luge , short track speed skating , freestyle skiing , skeleton , and snowboarding , have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic program . Others ( such as curling and bobsleigh ) have been discontinued and later reintroduced , or have been permanently discontinued ( such as military patrol , though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it ) . Still others , such as speed skiing , bandy and skijoring , were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports . The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced the profile of the Games . It created an income stream , via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising , which has become lucrative for the IOC . This allowed outside interests , such as television companies and corporate sponsors , to exert influence . The IOC has had to address several criticisms , internal scandals , the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians , as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics . Nations have used the Winter Games to showcase the claimed superiority of their political systems .   The Winter Olympics has been hosted on three continents by eleven different countries . The United States has hosted the Games four times ( 1932 , 1960 , 1980 , 2002 ) ; France has been the host three times ( 1924 , 1968 , 1992 ) ; Austria ( 1964 , 1976 ) , Canada ( 1988 , 2010 ) , Japan ( 1972 , 1998 ) , Italy ( 1956 , 2006 ) , Norway ( 1952 , 1994 ) , and Switzerland ( 1928 , 1948 ) have hosted the Games twice . Germany ( 1936 ) , Yugoslavia ( 1984 ) , and Russia ( 2014 ) have hosted the Games once . The IOC has selected Pyeongchang , South Korea , to host the 2018 Winter Olympics and Beijing , China , to host the 2022 Winter Olympics . No country in the southern hemisphere has hosted or even been an applicant to host the Winter Olympics ; the major challenge preventing one hosting the games is the dependence on winter weather , and the traditional February timing of the games falls in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer .   Twelve countries – Austria , Canada , Finland , France , Great Britain , Hungary , Italy , Norway , Poland , Sweden , Switzerland and the United States – have sent athletes to every Winter Olympic Games . Six of those – Austria , Canada , Finland , Norway , Sweden and the United States – have earned medals at every Winter Olympic Games , and only one – the United States – has earned gold at each Games . Germany and Japan have been banned at times from competing in the Games .   Sports   The Olympic Charter limits winter sports to `` those ... which are practised on snow or ice . '' Since 1992 a number of new sports have been added to the Olympic programme ; which include short track speed skating , snowboarding , freestyle and moguls skiing . The addition of these events has broadened the appeal of the Winter Olympics beyond Europe and North America . While European powers such as Norway and Germany still dominate the traditional"], [98, "Puerto Rico ( Spanish for 'Rich Port ' ) ( or ; , ) , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( , `` Associated Free State of Puerto Rico '' ) is the largest insular territory of the United States , and it is located in the northeastern Caribbean Sea . It is an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller islands such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . The territory does not observe daylight saving time , and its official languages are Spanish , which is predominant , and English . The island 's population is approximately 3.5 million . Puerto Rico 's rich history , tropical climate , diverse natural scenery , renowned traditional cuisine , and attractive tax incentives make it a popular destination for travelers from around the world .   Originally populated by the aboriginal Taíno people , the island was claimed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus for the Kingdom of Spain , enduring several invasion attempts by the French , Dutch , and British . During the four centuries of Spanish rule , the island 's ethnic , cultural and physical landscapes were transformed , as the island was settled overwhelmingly by Spanish settlers , primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , continuing right up until the end of the 19th century , as a result of which it is overwhelmingly Catholic and markedly Hispanic territory in terms of culture and language . In 1898 , following the Spanish–American War , the United States annexed the island under the terms of the Treaty of Paris .   Puerto Ricans are natural-born citizens of the United States . Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the United States Congress , which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 . As a U.S. territory , American citizens residing on the island are `` disenfranchised at the national level '' and may not vote for president and vice president of the United States . However , Congress approved a local constitution , allowing U.S. citizens on the territory to elect a governor .   A 2012 referendum showed a majority ( 54 % of the electorate ) disagreed with `` the present form of territorial status , '' with full statehood as the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status . However , 470,000 voters left the second question blank , leading statehood opponents to suggest that the referendum actually revealed only 45 % support for statehood . Following the vote , the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution to request the president and Congress of the United States to end its current status as an unincorporated U.S. territory and begin the process of admission to the union as a state .   Etymology   Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen – a derivation of Borikén , its indigenous Taíno name , which means `` Land of the Valiant Lord . '' The terms boricua and borincano derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively , and are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage . The island is also popularly known in Spanish as la isla del encanto , meaning `` the island of enchantment . ''   Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of Saint John the Baptist , while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico ( ) . Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico , while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city .   The island 's name was briefly changed to `` Porto Rico '' by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 . The anglicized name was used by the US government and private enterprises . The name was finally changed back to Puerto Rico by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila in 1931 .   History   Pre-Columbian era   The ancient history of the archipelago known today as Puerto Rico is not well known . Unlike other larger , more advanced indigenous communities in the New World ( Aztec and Inca ) whose people left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies , the indigenous population of Puerto Rico left scant artifacts and evidence . The scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish scholarly accounts from the colonial era constitute the basis of knowledge about them . The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was"], [99, "The Triassic is a geologic period and system that extends from to million years ago , an interval of 50.87 million years . It is the first period of the Mesozoic Era , and lies between the Permian and Jurassic periods . Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events . The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti , after the three distinct rock layers ( tri meaning `` three '' ) that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europe—red beds , capped by marine limestone , followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstones—called the `` Trias '' .Friedrich von Alberti , Beitrag zu einer Monographie des bunten Sandsteins , Muschelkalks und Keupers , und die Verbindung dieser Gebilde zu einer Formation [ Contribution to a monograph on the colored sandstone , shell limestone and mudstone , and the joining of these structures into one formation ] ( Stuttgart and Tübingen , ( Germany ) : J. G. Cotta , 1834 ) . Alberti coined the term `` Trias '' on [ https : //books.google.com/books ? id1ClSAAAAcAAJ & pg  PA324 # vonepage & q & f  false page 324 ] : '' … bunter Sandstein , Muschelkalk und Keuper das Resultat einer Periode , ihre Versteinerungen , um mich der Worte E. de Beaumont ’ s zu bedeinen , die Thermometer einer geologischen Epoche seyen , … also die bis jezt beobachtete Trennung dieser Gebilde in 3 Formationen nicht angemessen , und es mehr dem Begriffe Formation entsprechend sey , sie zu einer Formation , welche ich vorläufig Trias nennen will , zu verbinden . `` ( … colored sandstone , shell limestone , and mudstone are the result of a period ; their fossils are , to avail myself of the words of E. de Beaumont , the thermometer of a geologic epoch ; … thus the separation of these structures into 3 formations , which has been maintained until now , is n't appropriate , and it is more consistent with the concept of `` formation '' to join them into one formation , which for now I will name `` trias '' . )   The Triassic began in the wake of the Permian–Triassic extinction event , which left the Earth 's biosphere impoverished ; it would take well into the middle of the period for life to recover its former diversity . Therapsids and archosaurs were the chief terrestrial vertebrates during this time . A specialized subgroup of archosaurs , dinosaurs , first appeared in the Late Triassic but did not become dominant until the succeeding Jurassic . The first true mammals , themselves a specialized subgroup of Therapsids also evolved during this period , as well as the first flying vertebrates , the pterosaurs , who like the dinosaurs were a specialized subgroup of archosaurs . The vast supercontinent of Pangaea existed until the mid-Triassic , after which it began to gradually rift into two separate landmasses , Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south . The global climate during the Triassic was mostly hot and dry , [ http : //news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121018-triassic-extinctions-hot-global-warming-science-environment/ `` Lethally Hot '' Earth Was Devoid of Life—Could It Happen Again ? ] with deserts spanning much of Pangaea 's interior . However , the climate shifted and became more humid as Pangaea began to drift apart . The end of the period was marked by yet another major mass extinction , the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event , wiping out many groups and allowing dinosaurs to assume dominance in the Jurassic .   Dating and subdivisions   The Triassic is usually separated into Early , Middle , and Late Triassic Epochs , and the corresponding rocks are referred to as Lower , Middle , or Upper Triassic . The faunal stages from the youngest to oldest are :   Paleogeography   During the Triassic , almost all the Earth 's land mass was concentrated into a single supercontinent centered more or less on the equator , called Pangaea ( `` all the land '' ) . From the east a vast gulf entered Pangaea , the Tethys sea . It opened farther westward in the mid-Triassic , at the expense of the shrinking Paleo-Tethys Ocean , an ocean that existed during the Paleozoic . The remaining shores were surrounded by the world-ocean known as Panthalassa ( `` all the sea '' ) . All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates ; thus , very little is known of the Triassic open ocean .  The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated .

Due to cultural , political and historical reasons , Italy is a Western European country . Italy covers an area of 301338 km2 and has a largely temperate seasonal climate or Mediterranean climate ; due to its shape , it is often referred to in Italy as lo Stivale ( the Boot ) . With 61 million inhabitants , it is the third most populous EU member state . Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea , Italy shares open land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , San Marino and Vatican City .   Since classical times , ancient Phoenicians and Greeks , Etruscans , and Celts have inhabited the south , centre and north of the Italian Peninsula respectively , with various Italic peoples dispersed throughout Italy alongside other ancient Italian tribes and Greek , Carthaginian , and Phoenician colonies . The Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom , which eventually spread throughout Italy , assimilating and conquering other nearby civilizations and forming the Roman Republic . Rome ultimately emerged as the dominant power , conquering much of the ancient world and becoming the leading cultural , political , and religious centre of Western civilisation . The legacy of the Roman Empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law , republican governments , Christianity and the Latin script .   During the Middle Ages , Italy suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous barbarian invasions , but by the 11th century , numerous rival city-states and maritime republics rose to great prosperity through shipping , commerce , and banking , and even laid the groundwork for capitalism . These independent city-states and regional republics , acting as Europe 's main port of entry for Asian and Near Eastern imported goods , often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy in comparison to the monarchies and feudal states found throughout Europe at the time , though much of central Italy remained under the control of the theocratic Papal States , while Southern Italy remained largely feudal , partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine , Arab , Norman , Spanish , and Bourbon conquests of the region .   The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe , bringing a renewed interest in humanism , science , exploration , and art with the start of the modern era . Italian culture flourished at this time , producing famous scholars , artists , and polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci , Galileo , Michelangelo , and Machiavelli . Explorers from Italy such as Marco Polo , Christopher Columbus , Amerigo Vespucci , and Giovanni da Verrazzano discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World , helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery . Nevertheless , Italy 's importance as a hub of commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes from the New World , as New World imports and trade routes became more influential in Europe and bypassed the East Asian and Mediterranean trade routes that the Italian city-states had dominated . Furthermore , the Italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare , with this tension and violent rivalry culminating in the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries , a series of wars and foreign invasions that left the Italian states vulnerable to annexation by neighboring European powers . Italy would remain politically fragmented and fall prey to conquest , occupation , and general foreign domination by European powers such as France , Spain , and Austria , subsequently entering a long period of decline .   By the mid-19th century , a rising movement in support of Italian nationalism and Italian independence from foreign control lead to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the Risorgimento , which sought to bring about a rebirth of Italian cultural and economic prominence by liberating and consolidating the Italian peninsula and insular Italy into an independent and unified nation-state . After various unsuccessful attempts , the Italian Wars of Independence , the Expedition of the Thousand and the capture of Rome resulted in the eventual unification of the country , now a great power after centuries of foreign domination and political division . From the late 19th century to the early 20th century , the new Kingdom of Italy rapidly industrialized , especially in the so-called Industrial Triangle of Milan , Turin and Genoa in the"], [101, "Young Guns is a 1988 American western film directed by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco . The film was the first to be produced by Morgan Creek Productions . The film stars Emilio Estevez , Kiefer Sutherland , Lou Diamond Phillips , Charlie Sheen , Dermot Mulroney , Casey Siemaszko , Terence Stamp , Terry O'Quinn , Brian Keith , and Jack Palance .   Young Guns is a retelling of the adventures of Billy the Kid during the Lincoln County War , which took place in New Mexico during 1877–78 . It was filmed in and around New Mexico . Historian Dr. Paul Hutton called Young Guns the most historically accurate of all prior Billy the Kid films . It opened no . 1 at the box office , eventually earning $ 45 million from a moderate $ 11 million budget . A sequel , Young Guns II , was released in 1990 .   Plot   John Tunstall ( Terence Stamp ) , an educated Englishman and cattle rancher in Lincoln County , New Mexico , hires wayward young gunmen to live and work on his ranch . Tunstall is in heavy competition with a well-connected Irishman named Lawrence Murphy ( Jack Palance ) , who owns a large ranch ; their men clash on a regular basis . Tunstall recruits Billy ( Emilio Estevez ) and advises him to renounce violence saying that `` He who sows the wind will reap the whirlwind . '' Tensions escalate between the two camps , resulting in the murder of Tunstall . Billy , Doc Scurlock ( Kiefer Sutherland ) , Jose Chavez y Chavez ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) , Richard M. `` Dick '' Brewer ( Charlie Sheen ) , `` Dirty '' Steve Stephens ( Dermot Mulroney ) , and Charlie Bowdre ( Casey Siemaszko ) , consult their lawyer friend Alexander McSween ( Terry O'Quinn ) , who manages to get them deputized and given warrants for the arrest of Murphy 's murderous henchmen .   Billy quickly challenges Dick 's authority as leader , vowing revenge against Murphy and the men responsible for killing Tunstall . The men call themselves The Regulators and arrest some of the murderers , but hot-headed Billy is unable to wait for justice . He guns down unarmed men and goes on to kill one of his fellow Regulators ( later arrival J. McCloskey ) in the paranoid ( but correct ) belief that he was still in league with Murphy . The men are stripped of their badges , which they find out about by reading a newspaper . That same paper also confuses Dick for Billy , showing a picture of Dick labeled Billy the Kid , a nickname to which Billy takes an immediate liking .   While the local authorities begin their hunt for Billy and the boys , the Regulators argue about continuing with their warrants or to go on the run . One of the men on their list of warrants , Buckshot Roberts ( Brian Keith ) , tracks them down , barricades himself in an outhouse , and Dick dies in an intense shootout . Billy appoints himself as the new leader , the gang becomes famous and the U.S. Army is charged with bringing them to justice under Murphy 's corrupt political influence .   The gang eludes attention for some time , and Charlie gets married in Mexico . While attending the wedding , Billy meets Pat Garrett ( Patrick Wayne ) who is not yet a sheriff , but warns Billy of an attempt on Alex 's life by Murphy 's men that will happen the next day . Thus the gang packs up and heads off to save Alex .   Back in Lincoln , Murphy 's men , led by George W. Peppin , surround Alex 's house , trapping the Regulators , and a shootout begins . A ceasefire is called for the night . In the morning , accompanied by Murphy , the army comes in and torches the house , but Chavez escapes out the back . While the house is burning , the men come up with an escape plan . They begin throwing Alex 's possessions out the windows of the second floor . Billy places himself inside of a large trunk , and when it lands in front of the house , he leaps out and begins to open fire .   Meanwhile , Doc bursts out of the side stairway , followed by Charlie and Steve . Everyone makes it to the lawn , but Billy is shot twice in his arms .

She has received numerous awards and other accolades for her groundbreaking role in country music , including awards from both the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music as a duet partner and individual artist . She remains the most awarded female country recording artist , including her being the only female ACM Artist of the Decade ( 1970s ) .   Early years   Lynn is the second of eight children born to homemaker Clara Marie `` Clary '' ( née Ramey ; May 5 , 1912November 24 , 1981 ) and coal miner Melvin Theodore `` Ted '' Webb ( October 24 , 1906February 23 , 1959 ) . The Webbs had seven children besides Lynn :   * Melvin Webb ( December 4 , 1929 – July 1 , 1993 )  * Herman Webb ( September 3 , 1934 )  * Jay Lee ( born Willie Lee Webb ; February 12 , 1936July 31 , 1996 )  * Donald Ray Webb ( April 2 , 1941 )  * Peggy Sue Wright ( née Webb ; March 24 , 1943 )  * Betty Ruth Webb ( January 5 , 1946 )  * Crystal Gayle ( born Brenda Gail Webb ; January 9 , 1951 )   Lynn 's father would die at age 52 of Black lung disease a few years after relocating with wife Clary and Lynn 's younger siblings to Wabash , Indiana .   Path to stardom   In January 1948 , 15-year-old Loretta married Oliver `` Doolittle '' Lynn ( 1926–1996 ) . Their life together inspired the music she wrote .   In 1953 Doolittle bought her a $ 17 Harmony guitar . She taught herself to play . Over the following three years she worked to improve her guitar playing and with Doolittle 's encouragement started her own band , `` Loretta and the Trailblazers '' , with her brother , Jay Lee , playing lead guitar . She often appeared at Bill 's Tavern in Blaine , Washington , and the Delta Grange Hall in Custer , Washington , with the Pen Brothers ' band and The Westerneers . She eventually cut her first record , `` I 'm a Honky Tonk Girl '' , in February 1960 .   She became a part of the country music scene in Nashville in the 1960s , and in 1967 charted her first of 16 number-one hits ( out of 70 charted songs as a solo artist and a duet partner ) that include `` Do n't Come Home A ' Drinkin ' ( With Lovin ' on Your Mind ) '' , `` You Ai n't Woman Enough '' , `` Fist City '' , and `` Coal Miner 's Daughter '' .   Lynn focused on blue-collar women 's issues with themes about philandering husbands and persistent mistresses , inspired by issues she faced in her marriage . She pushed boundaries in the conservative genre of country music by singing about birth control ( `` The Pill '' ) , repeated childbirth ( `` One 's on the Way '' ) , double standards for men and women ( `` Rated `` X '' '' ) , and being widowed by the draft during the Vietnam War ( `` Dear Uncle Sam '' ) .   Country music radio stations often refused to play her music , banning nine of her songs , but Lynn pushed on to become one of country music 's legendary artists . Lynn and contemporaries like Tammy Wynette provided a template for female artists in country music to follow . In 1980 , her best-selling 1976 autobiography Coal Miner 's Daughter was made into an Academy Award-winning film , Coal Miner 's Daughter , starring Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones . Her most recent album , Van Lear Rose , released in 2004 , was produced by fellow musician Jack White ; Lynn and White were nominated for five Grammys and won two .   Lynn has received numerous awards in country and American music . She was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1983 , the Country Music Hall Of Fame in 1988 , and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2008 , and she was honored in 2010 at the Country Music Awards . Her most recent honor is the 2013 Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama ( awarded also to Bill Clinton , Oprah Winfrey , and Bob Dylan ) ."], [103, "A piano sonata is a sonata written for a solo piano . Piano sonatas are usually written in three or four movements , although some piano sonatas have been written with a single movement ( Scarlatti , Scriabin , Medtner ) , two movements ( Haydn ) , five ( Brahms ' Third Piano Sonata ) or even more movements . The first movement is generally composed in sonata form .   The Baroque keyboard sonata   In the Baroque era , the use of the term `` sonata '' generally referred to either the sonata da chiesa ( church sonata ) or sonata da camera ( chamber sonata ) , both of which were sonatas for various instruments ( usually one or more violins plus basso continuo ) . The keyboard sonata was relatively neglected by most composers .   The sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti ( of which there are over 500 ) were the hallmark of the Baroque keyboard sonata , though they were for the most part unpublished during Scarlatti 's lifetime . The majority of these sonatas are in one-movement binary form , both sections being in the same tempo and utilizing the same thematic material . These sonatas are prized for both their technical difficulty and their musical and formal ingenuity . The influence of Spanish folk music is evident in Scarlatti 's sonatas .   Other composers of keyboard sonatas ( which were primarily written in two or three movements ) include Marcello , Giustini , Durante and Platti .   Piano sonatas in the Classical era   Although various composers in the 17th century had written keyboard pieces which they entitled `` Sonata '' , it was only in the classical era , when the piano displaced the earlier harpsichord and sonata form rose to prominence as a principle of musical composition , that the term `` piano sonata '' acquired a definite meaning and a characteristic form .   All the well-known Classical era composers , especially Joseph Haydn , Muzio Clementi , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , and Ludwig van Beethoven , wrote many piano sonatas . Muzio Clementi wrote more than 110 piano sonatas . He is well known as `` The Father of the Pianoforte '' . Clementi 's Opus 2 was the first real piano sonata composed . The much younger Franz Schubert also wrote many .   The 32 sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven , including the well-known Pathétique Sonata and the Moonlight Sonata , are often considered the pinnacle of piano sonata composition .   Piano sonatas in the Romantic era   As the Romantic era progressed after Beethoven and Schubert , piano sonatas continued to be composed , but in lesser numbers as the form took on a somewhat academic tinge and competed with shorter genres more compatible with Romantic compositional style . Franz Liszt 's comprehensive `` three-movements-in-one '' Sonata in B minor draws on the concept of thematic transformation first introduced by Schubert in his Wanderer Fantasie of 1822 .

He created some of the world 's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era .. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity .   Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms .   Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features . His plots were carefully constructed , and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives . Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them , opening up and inspiring a new class of readers .   Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age . His 1843 novella , A Christmas Carol , remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre . Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted , and , like many of his novels , evoke images of early Victorian London . His 1859 novel , A Tale of Two Cities , set in London and Paris , is his best-known work of historical fiction . Dickens 's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton—for its realism , comedy , prose style , unique characterisations , and social criticism . On the other hand , Oscar Wilde , Henry James , and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth , loose writing , and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism . The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings , such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters .   Early years   Charles John Huffam Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 , at 1 Mile End Terrace ( now 393 Commercial Road ) , Landport in Portsea Island ( Portsmouth ) , the second of eight children of John Dickens ( 1785–1851 ) and Elizabeth Dickens ( née Barrow ; 1789–1863 ) . His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district . He asked Christopher Huffam , rigger to His Majesty 's Navy , gentleman , and head of an established firm , to act as godfather to Charles . Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey , the owner of a shipping company in Dickens 's eponymous Dombey and Son ( 1848 ) .   In January 1815 John Dickens was called back to London , and the family moved to Norfolk Street , Fitzrovia . When Charles was four , they relocated to Sheerness , and thence to Chatham , Kent , where he spent his formative years until the age of 11 . His early life seems to have been idyllic , though he thought himself a `` very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy '' .   Charles spent time outdoors but also read voraciously , including the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding , as well as Robinson Crusoe and Gil Blas . He read and reread The Arabian Nights and the Collected Farces of Elizabeth Inchbald . He retained poignant memories of childhood , helped by an excellent memory of people and events , which he used in his writing .

There are 118 elements that have been identified , of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements . There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes , which decay over time into other elements . Iron is the most abundant element ( by mass ) making up Earth , while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth .   Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe . However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15 % of the matter in the universe : the remainder is dark matter , the composition of which is unknown , but it is not composed of chemical elements .  The two lightest elements , hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe . The next three elements ( lithium , beryllium and boron ) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation , and are thus more rare than those that follow . Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis . The high abundance of oxygen , silicon , and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars . Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae , which , when they explode , blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants , where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed .   The term `` element '' is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons ( regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded , e.g . hydrogen in water ) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element ( e.g . hydrogen gas ) . For the second meaning , the terms `` elementary substance '' and `` simple substance '' have been suggested , but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature , whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used ( e.g . French corps simple , Russian простое вещество ) . One element can form multiple substances different by their structure ; they are called allotropes of the element .   When different elements are chemically combined , with the atoms held together by chemical bonds , they form chemical compounds . Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals . Among the more common of such `` native elements '' are copper , silver , gold , carbon ( as coal , graphite , or diamonds ) , and sulfur . All but a few of the most inert elements , such as noble gases and noble metals , are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form , as chemical compounds . While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms , most of these occur as mixtures . For example , atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen , oxygen , and argon , and native solid elements occur in alloys , such as that of iron and nickel .   The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon , sulfur , copper and gold . Later civilizations extracted elemental copper , tin , lead and iron from their ores by smelting , using charcoal . Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more , with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900 .   The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table , which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows ( `` periods '' ) in which the columns ( `` groups '' ) share recurring ( `` periodic '' ) physical and chemical properties . Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives , all of the elements are available industrially , most of them in high degrees of purity .   Description   The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium , both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass ( or 12:1 by number of atoms ) , along with tiny traces of the next two elements , lithium and"], [106, "Giovanni Antonio Canal ( 28 October 1697 – 19 April 1768 ) , better known as Canaletto , was an Italian painter of landscapes , or vedute , of Venice . He was also an important printmaker in etching . He was the son of the painter Bernardo Canal , he visited England between 1746–56 and he is famous for his urban landscapes of Venice . He is very famous for his scenes , usually associated with `` evocative views of the city '' . The Stonemason´s Yard , was his finest work around 1725 and was presented by Sir George Beaumont in 1823/8 .   Canaletto , together with Giambattista Pittoni , Giovan Battista Tiepolo , Giovan Battista Piazzetta , Giuseppe Maria Crespi and Francesco Guardi forms the ultimate group of Venetian old master painters .   Early career   He was born in Venice as the son of the painter Bernardo Canal , hence his mononym Canaletto ( `` little Canal '' ) , and Artemisia Barbieri . Canaletto served his apprenticeship with his father and his brother . He began in his father 's occupation , that of a theatrical scene painter . Canaletto was inspired by the Roman vedutista Giovanni Paolo Pannini , and started painting the daily life of the city and its people .   After returning from Rome in 1719 , he began painting in his topographical style . His first known signed and dated work is Architectural Capriccio ( 1723 , Milan , in a private collection ) . Studying with the older Luca Carlevarijs , a moderately-talented painter of urban cityscapes , he rapidly became his master 's equal .   In 1725 , the painter Alessandro Marchesini , who was also the buyer for the Lucchese art collector Stefano Conti , had inquired about buying two more 'views of Venice ' , when the agent urged him to consider instead the work of `` Antonio Canale ... it is like Carlevaris , but you can see the sun shining in it . ''   Outdoor painting   Much of Canaletto 's early artwork was painted `` from nature '' , differing from the then customary practice of completing paintings in the studio . Some of his later works do revert to this custom , as suggested by the tendency for distant figures to be painted as blobs of colour – an effect produced by using a camera obscura , which blurs farther-away objects .   However , his paintings are always notable for their accuracy : he recorded the seasonal submerging of Venice in water and ice .   Early and late work   Canaletto 's early works remain his most coveted and , according to many authorities , his best . One of his early pieces is The Stonemason 's Yard ( 1729 , London , the National Gallery ) which depicts a humble working area of the city .   Later Canaletto painted grand scenes of the canals of Venice and the Doge 's Palace . His large-scale landscapes portrayed the city 's pageantry and waning traditions , making innovative use of atmospheric effects and strong local colors . For these qualities , his works may be said to have anticipated Impressionism .   His graphic print S.A Giustina in Prà della Vale was found in the 2012 Nazi loot discovery .   Work in England   Many of his pictures were sold to Englishmen on their Grand Tour , often through the agency of the merchant Joseph Smith ( who was later appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744 ) .   It was Smith who acted as an agent for Canaletto , first in requesting paintings of Venice from the painter in the early 1720s and helping him to sell his paintings to other Englishmen .   In the 1740s Canaletto 's market was disrupted when the War of the Austrian Succession led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice . Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of `` capricci '' ( or architectural phantasies ) ( capriccio Italian for fancy ) in his vedute ideale , but the returns were not high enough , and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London , to be closer to his market .   He remained in England until 1755 , producing views of London ( including several of the new Westminster Bridge , which was completed during his stay ) and of his patrons ' castles and houses . His 1754 painting of Old Walton Bridge includes an image of Canaletto himself .   He was often expected to paint England"], [107, "Chief Clarence `` Clancy '' Wiggum is a fictional character from the animated television series The Simpsons , voiced by Hank Azaria . He is the chief of police in the show 's setting of Springfield . He is the father of Ralph Wiggum and the husband of Sarah Wiggum .   The character 's comedic value relies heavily on his incompetence and irresponsibility as a police officer , and his laziness and gluttony . Chief Wiggum 's more responsible fellow officers Eddie and Lou play the straight men to his shenanigans .   Biography   Chief Wiggum was born in Ireland and moved to Springfield at an early age . Per the episode Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in `` The Curse of the Flying Hellfish '' , Wiggum 's father , Iggy , served in Abe Simpson 's infantry squad , implying the Wiggums emigrated to America by the early 1940s at the latest . In the episode `` Mother Simpson '' , a teenaged Wiggum was a trainee security guard at Springfield University when Homer 's mother Mona sabotaged the University 's laboratory , which Mr. Burns was using for biological weapons . Antibiotics used to kill the weapons cured Wiggum 's asthma , allowing him to join the police force .   Many episodes have dealt with the back story of how Wiggum , despite his incompetences , occupies such a high role in the police force . As with those of most supporting characters on the show , they are jokes for one episode and contradict each other . Wiggum was temporarily promoted to Commissioner of Police for Springfield 's state in the 2005 episode `` Pranksta Rap '' .   Chief Wiggum is the father of Ralph Wiggum , whom he loves and is patient of , but he sometimes does not understand his son 's eccentricities .   Incompetence   Wiggum 's descriptions of suspects , evidence and location is often very poor . He also has been known to arrest people impulsively , disregarding their involvement of a determined situation or crime , evident in `` Brother from Another Series '' where he arrested Sideshow Bob by the incidents of the episode , despite Bart and Lisa ( the main witnesses ) confirming his innocence , and in `` The Frying Game '' where he gleefully condemns Homer and Marge to death for murder without using a lie detector or making a DNA examination . He has also , on occasions had people arrested or put in a jail cell for an invalid reason . For example in `` Midnight Rx '' , he attempts to arrest Grandpa on a charge of startling a police officer rather than for the drug smuggling he had been involved in with Homer during the episode . in `` Much Apu About Nothing '' , he orders Barney to be booked on one count of being an accessory to being a bear , in `` Homer 's Barbershop Quartet '' , it is implied that he arrests Homer , Principal Skinner , Barney and Apu for rejecting him from their group The B-Sharps and in `` On a Clear Day I Ca n't See My Sister '' he puts Lou in a police cell because his coffee came back cold ( despite Lou insisting that Wiggum ordered `` an iced coffee ) . Furthermore in `` The Seven-Beer Snitch '' , he assists Mr Burns in filling up his newly opened prison with convicts by reinstating old and forgotten laws- which subsequently results in Homer being arrested for `` Illegally transporting litter '' ( five kicks of the same can ) .   Wiggum also often fails to comply with his police duties in a real emergency , and sometimes does not take emergency calls seriously . Occasionally , he turns off his receiver when he is not in the mood to fight crime , or makes an excuse that he is too busy to help and it is then shown that the police are taking part in a trivial activity . He has demonstrated a lack of respect for firearms safety , having sold parts of his service pistol after losing his job ( `` Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment '' ) , used it to crack walnuts ( `` I Love Lisa '' ) and eaten donuts off its barrel , nearly killing himself as a result when it goes off ( The Simpsons Movie ) .   It is also frequently implied that Chief Wiggum is corrupt . He has been seen asking both Homer and Troy McLure for bribes and on his badge , it states `` Cash Bribes only ''"], [108, "Ancient Rome was an Italic civilization that began on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 8th century BC . Located along the Mediterranean Sea and centered on the city of Rome , it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants ( roughly 20 % of the world 's populationMcEvedy and Jones ( 1978 ) . ) and covering 6.5 million square kilometers ( 2.5 million sq mi ) at its height between the first and second centuries AD .   In its approximately 12 centuries of existence , Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to a classical republic and then to an increasingly autocratic empire . Through conquest and assimilation , it came to dominate Southern and Western Europe , Asia Minor , North Africa , and parts of Northern and Eastern Europe . Rome was preponderant throughout the Mediterranean region and was one of the most powerful entities of the ancient world . It is often grouped into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece , and their similar cultures and societies are known as the Greco-Roman world .   Ancient Roman society has contributed to modern government , law , politics , engineering , art , literature , architecture , technology , warfare , religion , language and society . A highly developed civilization , Rome professionalized and expanded its military and created a system of government called res publica , the inspiration for modern republics such as the United States and France . It achieved impressive technological and architectural feats , such as the construction of an extensive system of aqueducts and roads , as well as the construction of large monuments , palaces , and public facilities .   By the end of the Republic ( 27 BC ) , Rome had conquered the lands around the Mediterranean and beyond : its domain extended from the Atlantic to Arabia and from the mouth of the Rhine to North Africa . The Roman Empire emerged with the end of the Republic and the dictatorship of Augustus Caesar . 721 years of Roman-Persian Wars started in 92 BC with their first war against Parthia . It would become the longest conflict in human history , and have major lasting effects and consequences for both empires . Under Trajan , the Empire reached its territorial peak . Republican mores and traditions started to decline during the imperial period , with civil wars becoming a prelude common to the rise of a new emperor . Splinter states , such as the Palmyrene Empire , would temporarily divide the Empire during the crisis of the 3rd century .   Plagued by internal instability and attacked by various migrating peoples , the western part of the empire broke up into independent kingdoms in the 5th century . This splintering is a landmark historians use to divide the ancient period of universal history from the pre-medieval `` Dark Ages '' of Europe .   Founding myth   According to the founding myth of Rome , the city was founded on 21 April 753 BC by twin brothers Romulus and Remus , who descended from the Trojan prince Aeneas and who were grandsons of the Latin King , Numitor of Alba Longa . King Numitor was deposed from his throne by his brother , Amulius , while Numitor 's daughter , Rhea Silvia , gave birth to the twins . Because Rhea Silvia was raped and impregnated by Mars , the Roman god of war , the twins were considered half-divine .   The new king , Amulius , feared Romulus and Remus would take back the throne , so he ordered them to be drowned . A she-wolf ( or a shepherd 's wife in some accounts ) saved and raised them , and when they were old enough , they returned the throne of Alba Longa to Numitor .   The twins then founded their own city , but Romulus killed Remus in a quarrel over the location of the Roman Kingdom , though some sources state the quarrel was about who was going to rule or give his name to the city . Romulus became the source of the city 's name . In order to attract people to the city , Rome became a sanctuary for the indigent , exiled , and unwanted . This caused a problem for Rome , which had a large workforce but was bereft of women . Romulus traveled to the neighboring towns and tribes and attempted to secure marriage rights , but as Rome was so full of undesirables they all refused . Legend says that the Latins invited the Sabines to a"], [109, "`` God Save the Queen '' ( alternatively `` God Save the King '' , depending on the gender of the reigning monarch ) is the national and/or royal anthem in a number of Commonwealth realms , their territories , and the British Crown Dependencies . The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant , but a 1619 attribution to John Bull is sometimes made .   It is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977 , as well as for several of the UK 's territories that have their own additional local anthem . It is also the royal anthem of all the aforementioned countries , as well as Australia ( since 1984 ) , Canada ( since 1980 ) , Barbados and Tuvalu . In countries not previously part of the British Empire , the tune of `` God Save the Queen '' has provided the basis for various patriotic songs , though still generally connected with royal ceremony . In the United States , the melody is used for the patriotic song `` My Country , 'T is of Thee '' . The melody is also used for the national anthem of Liechtenstein , Oben am jungen Rhein ( `` Up above the Young Rhine '' ) .   Beyond its first verse , which is consistent , `` God Save the King/Queen '' has many historic and extant versions . Since its first publication , different verses have been added and taken away and , even today , different publications include various selections of verses in various orders . In general , only one verse is sung . Sometimes two verses are sung , and on rare occasions , three .   The sovereign and his or her consort are saluted with the entire anthem , while other members of the Royal Family who are entitled to royal salute ( such as the Prince of Wales ) receive just the first six bars . The first six bars also form all or part of the Vice Regal Salute in some Commonwealth realms outside the UK ( e.g. , in Canada , governors general and lieutenant governors at official events are saluted with the first six bars of `` God Save the Queen '' followed by the first four and last four bars of `` O Canada '' ) , as well as the salute given to governors of British overseas territories .   History   In The Oxford Companion to Music , Percy Scholes points out the similarities to an early plainsong melody , although the rhythm is very distinctly that of a galliard , and he gives examples of several such dance tunes that bear a striking resemblance to `` God Save The King/Queen '' . Scholes quotes a keyboard piece by John Bull ( 1619 ) which has some similarities to the modern tune , depending on the placing of accidentals which at that time were unwritten in certain cases and left to the discretion of the player ( see musica ficta ) . He also points to several pieces by Henry Purcell , one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune , set to the words `` God Save The King '' . Nineteenth-century scholars and commentators mention the widespread belief that an old Scots carol , `` Remember O Thou Man '' was the source of the tune .   The first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in Thesaurus Musicus . The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year , with the landing of Charles Edward Stuart and was published in The Gentleman 's Magazine ( see illustration above ) . This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points , one as early as the first bar , but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem . It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745 , with , for example , Thomas Arne writing a setting of the tune for the Drury Lane Theatre .   Scholes ' analysis includes mention of `` untenable '' and `` doubtful '' claims , as well as `` an American misattribution '' . Some of these are :  * The French Marquise de Créquy wrote in her book `` Souvenirs '' , that the tune Grand Dieu Sauve Le Roi , was written by Jean-Baptiste Lully in gratitude for the survival by Louis XIV of an anal fistula operation . The surgical knife that was purpose-built for the occasion is"], [110, "The Emperor of Japan is the head of the Imperial Family and is the ceremonial head of state of Japan 's system of constitutional monarchy . According to the 1947 constitution , he is `` the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people . '' Historically , he is also the highest authority of the Shinto religion as he and his family are said to be the direct descendants of the sun-goddess Amaterasu , and his importance also lies in dealing with heavenly affairs , including Shinto ritual and rites throughout the nation .   In Japanese , the Emperor is called Tennō ( 天皇 ) , which means `` heavenly sovereign '' . In English , the use of the term Mikado ( 帝 ) for the Emperor was once common , but is now considered obsolete .   Currently , the Emperor of Japan is the only remaining monarch in the world reigning under the title of `` Emperor '' . The Imperial House of Japan is the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world . In the Kojiki or Nihon Shoki , a book of Japanese history finished in the eighth century , it is said that Japan was founded in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu . The current Emperor is Akihito . He acceded the Chrysanthemum Throne upon the death of his father , Emperor Shōwa ( Hirohito ) , in 1989 .   The role of the Emperor of Japan has historically alternated between a largely ceremonial symbolic role and that of an actual imperial ruler . Since the establishment of the first shogunate in 1192 , the Emperors of Japan have rarely taken on a role as supreme battlefield commander , unlike many Western monarchs . Japanese Emperors have nearly always been controlled by external political forces , to varying degrees . In fact , between 1192 and 1867 , the shoguns , or their shikken regents in Kamakura ( 1203–1333 ) , were the de facto rulers of Japan , although they were nominally appointed by the Emperor . After the Meiji restoration in 1867 , the Emperor was the embodiment of all sovereign power in the realm , as enshrined in the Meiji Constitution of 1889 . His current status as a figurehead dates from the 1947 Constitution .   Since the mid-nineteenth century , the Imperial Palace has been called Kyūjō ( 宮城 ) , later Kōkyo ( 皇居 ) , and is located on the former site of Edo Castle in the heart of Tokyo . Earlier , Emperors resided in Kyoto for nearly eleven centuries .   The Emperor 's Birthday ( December 23 ) is a national holiday .   Current role   Unlike most constitutional monarchies , the Emperor is not the nominal Chief Executive . Article 65 of the Constitution explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet , of which the Prime Minister is the leader . The Emperor is also not the ( ceremonial ) commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces . The Japan Self-Defense Forces Act of 1954 also explicitly vests this role with the Prime Minister .   The Emperor 's powers are limited only to important ceremonial functions . Article 4 of the Constitution stipulates that the Emperor `` shall perform only such acts in matters of state as are provided for in the Constitution and he shall not have powers related to government . '' It also stipulates that `` the advice and approval of the Cabinet shall be required for all acts of the Emperor in matters of state '' ( Article 3 ) . Article 4 also states that these duties can be delegated by the Emperor as provided for by law .   While the Emperor formally appoints the Prime Minister to office , Article 6 of the Constitution requires him to appoint the candidate `` as designated by the Diet '' , without specifically giving the Emperor the right to decline appointment .   Article 6 of the Constitution delegates the Emperor the following ceremonial roles :  # Appointment of the Prime Minister as designated by the Diet .  # Appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as designated by the Cabinet .   The Emperor 's other duties are laid down in article 7 of the Constitution , where it is stated that the `` Emperor with the advice and approval of the Cabinet , shall perform the following acts in matters of state on behalf of the people '' :  # Promulgation of amendments of the constitution , laws , cabinet orders , and treaties .  # Convocation of the Diet .  #"], [111, "Juan Valdez is a fictional character who has appeared in advertisements for the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia since 1958 , representing a Colombian coffee farmer . The advertisements were designed by the Doyle Dane Bernbach ad agency , with the goal of distinguishing 100 % -Colombian coffee from coffee blended with beans from other countries . He typically appears with his mule Conchita , carrying sacks of harvested coffee beans . He has become an icon for Colombia as well as coffee in general , and Juan Valdez 's iconic appearance is frequently mimicked or parodied in television and other media .   The Juan Valdez character is used as an ingredient brand , to specifically denote coffee beans that are only grown and harvested in Colombia . Part of the advertising campaign includes convincing consumers that there are specific benefits of Colombian-grown and harvested coffee beans , `` including how soil components , altitude , varieties and harvesting methods create good flavor . '' The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia is entirely owned and controlled by Colombia 's coffee farmers , ( cafeteros ) which number over 500,000 people .   History   Juan Valdez was initially portrayed by José F. Duval in both print advertisements and on television until 1969 . José Duval died in 1993 at the age of 72 .   Juan Valdez had been embodied by Carlos Sánchez since 1969 and voiced by Norman Rose . Sánchez played Valdez in a brief sequence in the 2003 comedy film Bruce Almighty . In 2006 , Sánchez announced his retirement , and Carlos Castañeda , a grower from the town of Andes , Antioquia , was selected by the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia as the new face of Juan Valdez .   Brand   There were 238 Juan Valdez coffee shops in 2013 , 135 in Colombia and 35 shops in other countries . Juan Valdez brand coffee is available in Chile , Costa Rica , Aruba , Ecuador , El Salvador , Panama , Spain , Kuwait , and the United States at supermarkets and Juan Valdez coffee shops .   Controversies   The name `` Juan Valdez '' is by no means unique , as both Juan and Valdez are common Spanish-language names and there are possibly thousands of men with this name alive today ( although the Valdez name is hardly known in the coffee growing regions of Colombia ) ; this became relevant in a 2006 lawsuit over the phrase `` Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee '' .   The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia sued cartoonist Mike Peters , creator of Mother Goose & Grimm , for a cartoon talking about Juan Valdez and Colombian coffee in January 2009 . In a weeklong series making fun of various commercial products , he referenced violence in Colombia by having a character say : `` Y'know , there 's a big crime syndicate in Colombia . So when they say there 's a little bit of Juan Valdez in every can , maybe they 're not kidding . '' The lawsuit was dropped after Mr. Peters apologized publicly .

Different from other goddesses , nymphs are generally regarded as divine spirits who animate nature , and are usually depicted as beautiful , young nubile maidens who love to dance and sing ; their amorous freedom sets them apart from the restricted and chaste wives and daughters of the Greek polis . They are beloved by many and dwell in mountainous regions and forests by lakes and streams . Although they would never die of old age nor illness , and could give birth to fully immortal children if mated to a god , they themselves were not necessarily immortal , and could be beholden to death in various forms . Charybdis and Scylla were once nymphs .   Other nymphs , always in the shape of young maidens , were part of the retinue of a god , such as Dionysus , Hermes , or Pan , or a goddess , generally the huntress Artemis . Nymphs were the frequent target of satyrs .   Etymology   Nymphs are personifications of the creative and fostering activities of nature , most often identified with the life-giving outflow of springs : as Walter Burkert ( Burkert 1985 : III.3.3 ) remarks , `` The idea that rivers are gods and springs divine nymphs is deeply rooted not only in poetry but in belief and ritual ; the worship of these deities is limited only by the fact that they are inseparably identified with a specific locality . ''   The Greek word has `` bride '' and `` veiled '' among its meanings : hence a marriageable young woman . Other readers refer the word ( and also Latin nubere and German Knospe ) to a root expressing the idea of `` swelling '' ( according to Hesychius , one of the meanings of is `` rose-bud '' ) .   Adaptations   The Greek nymphs were spirits invariably bound to places , not unlike the Latin genius loci , and the difficulty of transferring their cult may be seen in the complicated myth that brought Arethusa to Sicily . In the works of the Greek-educated Latin poets , the nymphs gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous Italian divinities of springs and streams ( Juturna , Egeria , Carmentis , Fontus ) , while the Lymphae ( originally Lumpae ) , Italian water-goddesses , owing to the accidental similarity of their names , could be identified with the Greek Nymphae . The mythologies of classicizing Roman poets were unlikely to have affected the rites and cult of individual nymphs venerated by country people in the springs and clefts of Latium . Among the Roman literate class , their sphere of influence was restricted , and they appear almost exclusively as divinities of the watery element .   In modern Greek folklore   The ancient Greek belief in nymphs survived in many parts of the country into the early years of the twentieth century , when they were usually known as `` nereids '' . At that time , John Cuthbert Lawson wrote : `` ... there is probably no nook or hamlet in all Greece where the womenfolk at least do not scrupulously take precautions against the thefts and malice of the nereids , while many a man may still be found to recount in all good faith stories of their beauty , passion and caprice .   `` Nor is it a matter of faith only ; more than once I have been in villages where certain Nereids were known by sight to several persons ( so at least they averred ) ; and there was a wonderful agreement among the witnesses in the description of their appearance and dress . ''   Nymphs tended to frequent areas distant from humans but could be encountered by lone travelers outside the village , where their music might be heard , and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool , either during the noon heat or in the middle of the night . They might appear in a whirlwind . Such encounters could be dangerous , bringing dumbness , besotted infatuation , madness or stroke to the unfortunate human . When parents believed their child to be nereid-struck , they would pray to Saint Artemidos .   Modern sexual connotations   Due to the depiction of the mythological nymphs as females who mate with men or women at their own volition , and are completely outside of male control , the term is often"], [113, "The European Union ( EU ) is a politico-economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe . It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million . The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states . EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people , goods , services , and capital within the internal market , enact legislation in justice and home affairs , and maintain common policies on trade , agriculture , fisheries , and regional development . Within the Schengen Area , passport controls have been abolished . A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002 , and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency .   The EU operates through a hybrid system of supranational and intergovernmental decision-making . The seven principal decision-making bodies—known as the institutions of the European Union—are the European Council , the Council of the European Union , the European Parliament , the European Commission , the Court of Justice of the European Union , the European Central Bank , and the European Court of Auditors .   The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) and the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , formed by the Inner Six countries in 1951 and 1958 , respectively . The community and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit . While no member state has , as yet , ever left the EU , a non-binding referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016 supported leaving . The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union in 1993 and introduced European citizenship . The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU , the Treaty of Lisbon , came into force in 2009 .   Covering 7.3 % of the world population , the EU in 2014 generated a nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ) of 18.495 trillion US dollars , constituting approximately 24 % of global nominal GDP and 17 % when measured in terms of purchasing power parity . Additionally , 26 out of 28 EU countries have a very high Human Development Index , according to the United Nations Development Program . In 2012 , the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy , the EU has developed a role in external relations and defence . The union maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations , the World Trade Organization , the G8 , and the G-20 . Because of its global influence , the European Union has been described as a current or as a potential superpower .   History   Preliminary ( 194557 )   After World War II , European integration was seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which had devastated the continent . The 1948 Hague Congress was a pivotal moment in European federal history , as it led to the creation of the European Movement International and of the College of Europe , where Europe 's future leaders would live and study together . 1952 saw the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community , which was declared to be `` a first step in the federation of Europe . '' The supporters of the Community included Alcide De Gasperi , Jean Monnet , Robert Schuman , and Paul-Henri Spaak .   Treaty of Rome ( 195792 )   In 1957 , Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome , which created the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and established a customs union . They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community ( Euratom ) for co-operation in developing nuclear energy . Both treaties came into force in 1958 .   The EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC , although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly . The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein ( Hallstein Commission ) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand ( Armand Commission ) and then Étienne Hirsch . Euratom was to integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union among members .   Through the 1960s , tensions began to show , with France seeking to limit supranational power .

Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on July 20 , 1969 , at 20:18 UTC . Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC ; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and collected of lunar material for return to Earth . The third crew member , Michael Collins , piloted the Command Module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rendezvousing with Columbia in lunar orbit .   Launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 , Apollo 11 was the fifth manned mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a Command Module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that landed back on Earth ; a Service Module ( SM ) , which supported the Command Module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a Lunar Module ( LM ) that had two stages – a lower stage for landing on the Moon , and an upper stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V 's upper stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility . They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface . The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the Command Module . They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth . They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 .   Broadcast on live TV to a world-wide audience , Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as `` one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind . '' Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by the U.S. President John F. Kennedy in a speech before the U.S. Congress : `` before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth . ''   Framework   Crew   Apollo 11 was the second all-veteran multi-person crew ( the first being Apollo 10 ) in human spaceflight history . A previous solo veteran flight had been made on Soyuz 1 in 1967 by Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov .   Collins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot ( CMP ) on Apollo 8 but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by Jim Lovell , his backup for that flight . After Collins was medically cleared , he took what would have been Lovell 's spot on Apollo 11 ; as a veteran of Apollo 8 , Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11 's backup crew and promoted to backup commander .   Backup crew   In early 1969 , Anders accepted a job with the National Space Council effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date . At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch ( at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed ) and would later join Lovell 's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original Apollo 13 CMP .

Starring in the lead role and using his own singing voice for the musical numbers , Kevin Spacey co-wrote , directed , and co-produced the film , which takes its title from Darin 's hit version of the song of the same name .   Beyond the Sea depicts Darin 's rise to success in both the music and film industry during the 1950s and 1960s , as well as his marriage to Sandra Dee , portrayed by Kate Bosworth .   As early as 1986 , Barry Levinson intended to direct a film based on the life of Darin , and he began pre-production on the project in early 1997 . When he eventually vacated the director 's position , Spacey , along with Darin 's son Dodd , acquired the film rights .   Beyond the Sea was released in December 2004 to mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box office . Dodd Darin , Sandra Dee and former Darin manager Steve Blauner responded with enthusiastic feedback to Spacey 's work on the film . Despite a number of negative reviews , some critics praised Spacey 's performance , largely due to his decision to use his own singing voice . He received a Golden Globe nomination .   Plot   Rather than providing a straightforward biography , the film weaves fantasy sequences with scenes containing somewhat fictionalized accounts of events in Darin 's life , and throughout it , the adult singer interacts with his younger self . It chronicles his determination to rise from his working class roots as Walden Robert Cassotto , a frail Bronx boy plagued by multiple bouts of rheumatic fever , and become a singer more famous than Frank Sinatra . To achieve that goal , he forms a band and struggles to find gigs at any nightclub that will hire him .   His agent gets Darin a recording contract with Atlantic Records , where the singer enjoys teen idol success with `` Splish Splash '' . Not wanting to limit his appeal to rock and roll audiences , he changes his niche to big band singing and records major hits , such as `` Mack the Knife . '' To capitalize on his popularity with teenage and young adult audiences , Darin is cast in Come September opposite Sandra Dee . He falls in love with the eighteen-year-old actress and , determined to marry her , he romantically seduces and enchants her with songs like `` Beyond the Sea '' and `` Dream Lover . '' The two elope , angering her mother . Darin finally realizes his own mother 's dream when he is signed to appear at the famed Copacabana nightclub in Manhattan .   As success takes him on the road and away from home , Dee begins to drink heavily , and the couple fights frequently . Eventually they separate , then reconcile . She gives birth to a son , Dodd .

It has a municipal population of 591,481 and a larger urban population of 1,280,371 ( ) . The Copenhagen metropolitan area has just over 2 million inhabitants . The city is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand ; another small portion of the city is located on Amager , and is separated from Malmö , Sweden , by the strait of Øresund .   Originally a Viking fishing village founded in the 10th century , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . After suffering from the effects of plague and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture . Later , following the Second World War , the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre .   Since the turn of the 21st century , Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development , facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure . The city is the cultural , economic and governmental centre of Denmark ; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange . Copenhagen 's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector , especially through initiatives in information technology , pharmaceuticals and clean technology . Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge , Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city , Malmö , forming the Øresund Region . With a number of bridges connecting the various districts , the cityscape is characterized by parks , promenades and waterfronts . Copenhagen 's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens , the Little Mermaid Statue , the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces , Rosenborg Castle Gardens , Frederik 's Church , and many museums , restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions .   Copenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen , the Technical University of Denmark and Copenhagen Business School . The University of Copenhagen , founded in 1479 , is the oldest university in Denmark . Copenhagen is home to the FC København and Brøndby football clubs . The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980 . Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world . The Copenhagen Metro serves central Copenhagen together with the S-train network connecting the outlying boroughs . Serving roughly 2 million passengers a month , Copenhagen Airport , Kastrup , is the largest airport in the Nordic countries .   Etymology   The name of the city reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce . The original designation , from which the contemporary Danish name derives , was Køpmannæhafn , meaning `` merchants ' harbour '' , often simply Hafn or Havn ( `` harbour '' ) . The literal English translation would be `` Chapman 's haven '' . The English name for the city was adapted from its Low German name , Kopenhagen . The abbreviations Kbh . or Kbhvn are often used in Danish for København , and kbh . for københavnsk ( of Copenhagen ) .   The chemical element hafnium is named for Copenhagen ( Latin name Hafnia ) , where it was discovered . The bacterium Hafnia is also named after Copenhagen : Vagn Møller of the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen named it in 1954 .   History   Early history   Although the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century , recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city 's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant 's mansion near today 's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020 . Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century . The remains of an ancient church , with graves dating to the 11th century , have been unearthed near where Strøget meets Rådhuspladsen .   These finds indicate that Copenhagen 's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century . Substantial"], [117, "Saturday Night Live ( abbreviated as SNL ) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol . The show premiered on NBC on October 11 , 1975 , under the original title NBC 's Saturday Night . The show 's comedy sketches , which parody contemporary culture and politics , are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members . Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest ( who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast ) and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it 's Saturday Night ! `` , properly beginning the show .   In 1980 Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities . He was replaced by Jean Doumanian , who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews . Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera . Others associated with the show , such as writers , have gone on to successful careers creating , writing , or starring in TV and film .   Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC 's headquarters in the Comcast Building , SNL has aired 808 episodes since its debut , and concluded its forty-first season on May 21 , 2016 , making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States . The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries , including Canada , Spain , Italy , South Korea , Japan , Brazil , and Finland , each meeting with different levels of success . Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers ( 1980 ) and Wayne 's World ( 1992 ) . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of '' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show .   Throughout four decades on air , Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards , including 42 Primetime Emmy Awards , two Peabody Awards , and three Writers Guild of America Awards . In 2000 , it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame . It was ranked tenth in TV Guide `` 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time '' list , and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine 's `` 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME '' . As of 2012 , it has received 156 Emmy nominations , the most received by any TV show . The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship , with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests .   Development    From 1965 until September 1975 , NBC ran The Best of Carson reruns of The Tonight Show , airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates ' discretion ( originally known as The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson ) . In 1974 Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weeknights , allowing him to take time off .   In 1974 NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming , Dick Ebersol , and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot . At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller , Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels . Over the next three weeks , Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter 's idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches , political satire , and music performances . By 1975 Michaels had assembled a talented cast , including Dan Aykroyd , John Belushi , Chevy Chase , Jane Curtin , Garrett Morris , Laraine Newman , Michael O'Donoghue , Gilda Radner , and George Coe . The show was originally called NBC 's Saturday Night , because Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC . NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26 , 1977"], [118, "Events   January–March   * January 4 – A military alliance is established between the French Third Republic and the Russian Empire .  * January 7 – William Kennedy Dickson receives a patent for motion picture film .  * January 9 – New England Telephone and Telegraph installs the first battery-operated telephone switchboard in Lexington , Massachusetts .  * February – In Korea , peasant unrest erupts in the Donghak Peasant Revolution , a massive revolt of followers of the Donghak movement .

Fewer than two percent of South Africans speak a first language other than an official one . Most South Africans can speak more than one language . Dutch and English were the first official languages of South Africa from 1910 to 1925 . Afrikaans was added as a part of Dutch in 1925 , although in practice , Afrikaans effectively replaced Dutch , which fell into disuse . When South Africa became a republic in 1961 the official relationship changed such that Afrikaans was considered to include Dutch , and Dutch was dropped in 1984 , so between 1984 and 1994 , South Africa had two official languages : English and Afrikaans .   Different government departments and official bodies use different terms to denote Northern Sotho . In South Africa , Southern Ndebele is known simply as Ndebele , as most speakers of Northern Ndebele live in Zimbabwe .   Since taking power in the 1994 election , the ANC has promoted English as the main language of government , even if South Africans often take pride in using indigenous languages for any purpose . Afrikaans also features prominently in commerce together with English , as the languages with the highest number of fluent speakers are Afrikaans and English .   In terms of linguistic classification , the official languages include two West Germanic languages ( English and Afrikaans ) and nine Bantu languages . Four of these are Nguni languages ( Zulu , Xhosa , Swati and Ndebele ) and three are Sotho–Tswana languages ( Northern Sotho , Southern Sotho and Tswana ) . Tsonga is a Tswa–Ronga language .   South African Sign Language is understood across the country , though sometimes sign-language interpreters use manually coded language .   Language demographics   The most common language spoken as a first language by South Africans is Zulu ( 23 percent ) , followed by Xhosa ( 16 percent ) , and Afrikaans ( 14 percent ) . English is the fourth most common first language in the country ( 9.6 % ) , but is understood in most urban areas and is the dominant language in government and the media .   The majority of South Africans speak a language from one of the two principal branches of the Bantu languages represented in South Africa : the Sotho–Tswana branch ( Sesotho , Northern Sotho , Tswana ) , or the Nguni branch ( Zulu , Xhosa , Swazi , Ndebele ) . For each of the two groups , the languages within that group are for the most part intelligible to a native speaker of any other language within that group .   The nine indigenous African languages of South Africa can be divided into two geographical zones , with Nguni languages being predominant in the south-eastern third of the country ( Indian Ocean coast ) and Sesotho languages being predominant in the northern third of the country located further inland , as also in Botswana and Lesotho . Gauteng is the most linguistically heterogeneous province , with roughly equal numbers of Nguni , Sesotho and Indo-European language speakers . This has resulted in the spread of an urban argot , Tsotsitaal , in large urban townships in the province .   Afrikaans , a language derived from Dutch , is the most widely spoken language in the western half of the country ( Western and Northern Cape ) . It is spoken as first language by approximately 61 percent of whites and 76 percent of Coloured ( multiracial ) people in the country . Afrikaans is also spoken widely across the centre and north of the country , as a second ( or third or even fourth ) language by Black South Africans living in farming areas .   The 2011 census recorded the following distribution of first language speakers :   Other significant languages spoken in South Africa   Other languages spoken in South Africa , though not mentioned in the Constitution , include Fanagalo , Lobedu ( Khilobedu ) , Northern Ndebele ( Sindebele ) , Phuthi ( Siphuthi ) .  Lobedu has been variously claimed to be a dialect of Northern Sotho and an autonomous language . Fanagalo is a pidgin often used as a mining lingua franca .   Significant numbers of immigrants from Europe , elsewhere in Africa , and the Indian subcontinent means that a wide variety of other languages can also be found in parts of South Africa . In the older immigrant'], [120, "Monotremes are mammals that lay eggs ( Prototheria ) instead of giving birth to live young like marsupials ( Metatheria ) and placental mammals ( Eutheria ) . The only surviving examples of monotremes are all indigenous to Australia and New Guinea , although there is evidence that they were once more widespread . The existing monotreme species are the platypus and four species of echidnas . There is currently some debate regarding monotreme taxonomy .   The word monotreme comes from the Greek μονός , monos ( `` single '' ) and τρῆμα , trema ( `` hole '' ) , referring to the cloaca .   General characteristics   Like other mammals , monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate ( though not as high as other mammals ; see below ) ; have hair on their bodies ; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young ; have a single bone in their lower jaw ; and have three middle-ear bones .   In common with reptiles and marsupials , monotremes lack the connective structure ( corpus callosum ) which in placental mammals is the primary communication route between the right and left brain hemispheres . The anterior commissure does provide an alternate communication route between the two hemispheres , though , and in monotremes and marsupials it carries all the commissural fibers arising from the neocortex , whereas in placental mammals the anterior commissure carries only some of these fibers .   Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults . Fossil forms and modern platypus young have a `` tribosphenic '' form of molars ( with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle ) , which is one of the hallmarks of extant mammals . Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials , although this is not well established . Monotreme jaws are constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals , and the jaw opening muscle is different . As in all true mammals , the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull , rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other premammalian synapsids ; this feature , too , is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , although , as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar , this is disputed . Nonetheless , findings on the extinct species Teinolophos confirm that suspended ear bones evolved independently among monotremes and therians . The external opening of the ear still lies at the base of the jaw .   The sequencing of the platypus genome has also provided insight into the evolution of a number of monotreme traits , such as venom and electroreception , as well as showing some new unique features , such as the fact that monotremes possess 10 sex chromosomes and that their X chromosome resembles the sex chromosome of birds , suggesting that the two sex chromosomes of marsupial and placental mammals evolved more recently than the split from the monotreme lineage . This feature , along with some other genetic similarities with birds , such as shared genes related to egg-laying , is thought to provide some insight into the most recent common ancestor of the synapsid lineage leading to mammals and the sauropsid lineage leading to birds and modern reptiles , which are believed to have split about 315 million years ago during the Carboniferous . The presence of vitellogenin genes ( a protein necessary for egg shell formation ) is shared with birds , suggesting that when the common ancestor of mammals from ~225 million years ago split into monotremes , marsupials , and placental mammals , egg laying was retained in monotremes and lost in all other mammals . DNA suggests that while this trait is shared and is synapomorphic with birds , platypuses are still mammals and they evolved lactation with other mammals . L-ascorbic acid is synthesized only in the kidneys .   The monotremes also have extra bones in the shoulder girdle , including an interclavicle and coracoid , which are not found in other mammals . Monotremes retain a reptile-like gait , with legs on the sides of , rather than underneath , their bodies . The monotreme leg bears a spur in the ankle region ; the spur is not functional in echidnas , but contains a powerful venom in the male platypus . This venom is derived from b-defensins , proteins that are present in mammals that create holes in viral and bacterial pathogens . Some reptile venom is also composed of different types of b-defensins , another trait shared with reptiles"], [121, "Ireland ( ; ) , also known as the Republic of Ireland ( ' ) , is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland . The capital and largest city is Dublin , which is located on the eastern part of the island , and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country 's 4.75 million inhabitants . The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland , a part of the United Kingdom . It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the Celtic Sea to the south , Saint George 's Channel to the south-east and the Irish Sea to the east . It is a unitary , parliamentary republic . The legislature , the ' , consists of a lower house , ' , an upper house , ' , and an elected President ( ' ) who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state , but with some important powers and duties . The head of government is the ' ( Prime Minister , literally 'Chief ' , a title not used in English ) , who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President , and appoints other government ministers .   The state was created as the Irish Free State in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . It had the status of dominion until 1937 when a new constitution was adopted , in which the state was named `` Ireland '' and effectively became a republic , with an elected non-executive president as head of state . It was officially declared a republic in 1949 , following the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 . Ireland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955 . It joined the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , the predecessor of the European Union , in 1973 . The state had no formal relations with Northern Ireland for most of the twentieth century , but during the 1980s and 1990s the British and Irish governments worked with the Northern Ireland parties towards a resolution to `` the Troubles '' . Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 , the Irish government and Northern Ireland Executive have co-operated on a number of policy areas under the North-South Ministerial Council created by the Agreement .   Ireland ranks among the top twenty-five wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita , and as the tenth most prosperous country in the world according to The Legatum Prosperity Index 2015 . After joining the EEC , Ireland enacted a series of liberal economic policies that resulted in rapid economic growth . The country achieved considerable prosperity between the years of 1995 and 2007 , which became known as the Celtic Tiger period . This was halted by an unprecedented financial crisis that began in 2008 , in conjunction with the concurrent global economic crash . However , as the Irish economy was the fastest growing in the EU in 2015 Ireland is again quickly ascending league tables comparing wealth and prosperity internationally . For example , in 2015 , Ireland was ranked as the joint sixth ( with Germany ) most developed country in the world by the United Nations Human Development Index . It also performs well in several national performance metrics , including freedom of the press , economic freedom and civil liberties . Ireland is a member of the European Union and is a founding member of the Council of Europe and the OECD . The Irish government has followed a policy of military neutrality through non-alignment since immediately prior to World War II and the country is consequently not a member of NATO , although it is a member in Partnership for Peace .   Name   The 1922 state , comprising 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland , was `` styled and known as the Irish Free State '' . The Constitution of Ireland , adopted in 1937 , provides that `` the name of the State is Éire , or , in the English language , Ireland '' . Section 2 of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 states , `` It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland . '' The 1948 Act does not name the state as `` Republic of Ireland '' , because to have done so would have put it in conflict with the Constitution .   The government of the United Kingdom used the name `` Eire '' ( without the diacritic ) , and , from 1949 , `` Republic of Ireland '' , for the state"], [122, "Halloween is a 1978 American independent slasher film directed and scored by John Carpenter , co-written with producer Debra Hill , and starring Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis in her film debut . The film was the first installment in what has become the Halloween franchise . The plot is set in the fictional Midwestern town of Haddonfield , Illinois . On Halloween night in 1963 , a six-year-old Michael Myers dressed in a clown costume murders his teenage sister by stabbing her with a kitchen knife . Fifteen years later , Michael Myers , age 21 , escapes from a psychiatric hospital , returns home , and stalks Laurie Strode and her friends . Michael 's psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis suspects Michael 's intentions , and follows him to Haddonfield to try to prevent him from killing .   Halloween was produced on a budget of $ 300,000 and grossed $ 47 million at the box office in the United States , and $ 70 million worldwide , equivalent to $ 250 million as of 2014 , becoming one of the most profitable independent films . Many critics credit the film as the first in a long line of slasher films inspired by Alfred Hitchcock 's Psycho ( 1960 ) . Halloween had many imitators and originated several clichés found in low-budget horror films of the 1980s and 1990s . Unlike many of its imitators , Halloween contains little graphic violence and gore . It was one of the first horror films to introduce the concept of the killer dying and coming back to life again within the same film . In 2006 , it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .   Some critics have suggested that Halloween may encourage sadism and misogyny by audiences identifying with its villain . Other critics have suggested the film is a social critique of the immorality of youth and teenagers in 1970s America , with many of Myers ' victims being sexually promiscuous substance abusers , while the lone heroine is depicted as innocent and pure , hence her survival . Nevertheless , Carpenter dismisses such analyses . Several of Halloweens techniques and plot elements , although not founded in this film , have nonetheless become standard slasher movie tropes . Halloween spawned seven sequels and was rebooted by Rob Zombie in 2007 . The first sequel to the original movie , Halloween II , was released in 1981 , three years after its predecessor .   Plot   On Halloween night of 1963 , six-year-old Michael Myers , dressed in a clown costume , stabs his teenage sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife . Fifteen years later , on October 30 , 1978 , he escapes from Smith 's Grove Sanitarium in a car that was to take him to a court hearing , the verdict of which was for him to be locked up forever .   The next day , 21-year-old Michael ( Nick Castle ) , now wearing a mechanic 's uniform and a white mask , returns to his hometown of Haddonfield , Illinois and begins stalking high school student Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) after she drops off a key at his old house so her father can sell it . Her two best friends Annie Brackett ( Nancy Loomis ) and Lynda van der Klok ( P. J. Soles ) dismiss Laurie 's concerns that someone is following her . Michael 's psychiatrist , Dr. Sam Loomis ( Donald Pleasence ) having anticipated Michael 's return home , goes to the local cemetery and finds Judith Myers ' headstone missing . Loomis meets with Annie 's father , Sheriff Leigh Brackett ( Charles Cyphers ) and monitors the local neighborhood to keep an eye out for Michael .   When Annie 's boyfriend Paul calls her to come pick him up , she takes Lindsey Wallace ( Kyle Richards ) to the Doyle house , just across the street , to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy Doyle ( Brian Andrews ) . After she gets into her car , Michael , who hid in the backseat , strangles Annie before slashing her throat . While playing hide-and-seek with Lindsey , Tommy sees Michael carrying Annie 's body into the Wallace house and thinks he is the `` boogeyman '' . He tries to tell a skeptical Laurie about what he saw . Later , Lynda and her boyfriend Bob enter the Wallace house to spend the night together . After having sex , Lynda asks Bob to go downstairs and"], [123, "Paul Gardner Allen ( born January 21 , 1953 ) is an American businessman , philanthropist , investor , musician , and innovator , best known as the co-founder of Microsoft , alongside Bill Gates .

Early life and education   Paul Allen was born on January 21 , 1953 in Seattle , Washington to Kenneth Sam Allen and Edna Faye ( née Gardner ) Allen . Allen attended Lakeside School , a private school in Seattle , where he befriended Bill Gates , three years younger , with whom he shared an enthusiasm for computers . They used Lakeside 's Teletype terminal to develop their programming skills on several time-sharing computer systems . After graduation , Allen went to Washington State University , where he joined Phi Kappa Theta fraternity , but dropped out after two years in order to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston , near where Bill Gates had ended up as well . Allen later convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard University in order to create Microsoft .   Microsoft    In Albuquerque , New Mexico , Paul Allen with his friend Bill Gates , in 1975 , began marketing a BASIC programming language interpreter . Allen came up with the original name of `` Micro-Soft , '' as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article . In 1980 , after promising to deliver IBM a Disk Operating System ( DOS ) they had not yet developed for the Intel 8088-based IBM PC , Allen spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase a Quick and Dirty Operating System ( QDOS ) which was written by Tim Paterson who , at the time , was employed at Seattle Computer Products . As a result of this transaction , Microsoft was able to secure a contract to supply the DOS that would eventually run on IBM 's PC line . This contract with IBM was the watershed in Microsoft history that led to Allen 's and Gates ' wealth and success . Allen effectively left Microsoft in 1982 due to serious illness . Allen officially resigned from his position on the Microsoft board of directors in November 2000 but was asked to consult as a senior strategy advisor to the company 's executives and still owns a reported 100 million shares .

The world 's first underground railway , the Metropolitan Railway , which opened in 1863 , is now part of the Circle , Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines ; the first line to operate underground electric traction trains , the City & South London Railway in 1890 , is now part of the Northern line . The network has expanded to 11 lines , and in 2015–16 carried 1.34 billion passengers , making it the world 's 11th busiest metro system .   The system 's first tunnels were built just below the surface , using the cut-and-cover method ; later , smaller , roughly circular tunnels – which gave rise to its nickname , the Tube – were dug through at a deeper level . The system has 270 stations and 250 mi of track . Despite its name , only 45 % of the system is actually underground in tunnels , with much of the network in the outer environs of London being on the surface . In addition , the Underground does not cover most southern parts of Greater London , with less than 10 % of the stations located south of the River Thames .   The early tube lines , originally owned by several private companies , were brought together under the `` '' brand in the early 20th century and eventually merged along with the sub-surface lines and bus services in 1933 to form London Transport under the control of the London Passenger Transport Board ( LPTB ) . The current operator , London Underground Limited ( LUL ) , is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London ( TfL ) , the statutory corporation responsible for the transport network in Greater London . , 92 % of operational expenditure is covered by passenger fares . The Travelcard ticket was introduced in 1983 and Oyster , a contactless ticketing system , in 2003 . Contactless card payments were introduced in 2014 .   The LPTB was a prominent patron of art and design , commissioning many new station buildings , posters and public artworks in a modernist style . The schematic Tube map , designed by Harry Beck in 1931 , was voted a national design icon in 2006 and now includes other TfL transport systems such as the Docklands Light Railway , London Overground and TfL Rail . Other famous London Underground branding includes the roundel and Johnston typeface , created by Edward Johnston in 1916 .   History   Early years   The idea of an underground railway linking the City of London with some of the railway termini in its urban centre was proposed in the 1830s , and the Metropolitan Railway was granted permission to build such a line in 1854 . To prepare construction , a short test tunnel was built in 1855 in Kibblesworth , a small town with geological properties similar to London . This test tunnel was used for two years in the development of the first underground train , and was later , in 1861 , filled up . The world 's first underground railway , it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives . It was hailed as a success , carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day , and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service . The Metropolitan District Railway ( commonly known as the District Railway ) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for an underground `` inner circle '' connecting London 's main-line termini . The Metropolitan and District railways completed the Circle line in 1884 , built using the cut and cover method . Both railways expanded , the District building five branches to the west reaching Ealing , Hounslow , Uxbridge , Richmond and Wimbledon and the Metropolitan eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire , more than 50 mi from Baker Street and the centre of London .   For the first deep-level tube line , the City and South London Railway , two 10 ft diameter circular tunnels were dug between King William Street ( close to today 's Monument station ) and Stockwell , under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface . This opened in 1890 with electric locomotives that hauled carriages with small opaque windows , nicknamed padded cells ."], [125, "|Circles of 9 and 12 - The 108 Human Types  |Circles of 9 and 12 - The 108 Human Types   In Western astrology , astrological signs are the twelve 30° sectors of the ecliptic , starting at the vernal equinox ( one of the intersections of the ecliptic with the celestial equator ) , also known as the First Point of Aries . The order of the astrological signs is Aries , Taurus , Gemini , Cancer , Leo , Virgo , Libra , Scorpio , Sagittarius , Capricorn , Aquarius and Pisces .   The concept of the zodiac originated in Babylonian astrology , and was later influenced by Hellenistic culture . According to astrology , celestial phenomena relate to human activity on the principle of `` as above , so below '' , so that the signs are held to represent characteristic modes of expression .   The twelve sector division of the ecliptic constitutes astrology 's primary frame of reference when considering the positions of celestial bodies , from a geocentric point of view , so that we may find , for instance , the Sun in 23° Aries ( 23° longitude ) , the Moon in 7° Scorpio ( 217° longitude ) , or Jupiter in 29° Pisces ( 359° longitude ) . Beyond the celestial bodies , other astrological points that are dependent on geographical location and time ( namely , the Ascendant , the Midheaven , the Vertex and the houses ' cusps ) are also referenced within this ecliptic coordinate system .   Various approaches to measuring and dividing the sky are currently used by differing systems of astrology , although the tradition of the Zodiac 's names and symbols remain consistent . Western astrology measures from Equinox and Solstice points ( points relating to equal , longest and shortest days of the tropical year ) , while Jyotiṣa or Vedic astrology measures along the equatorial plane ( sidereal year ) . Precession results in Western astrology 's zodiacal divisions not corresponding in the current era to the constellations that carry similar names , while Jyotiṣa measurements still correspond with the background constellations .   In Western and Asian astrology , the emphasis is on space , and the movement of the Sun , Moon and planets in the sky through each of the zodiac signs . In Chinese astrology , by contrast , the emphasis is on time , with the zodiac operating on cycles of years , months , and hours of the day .  A common feature of all three traditions however , is the significance of the Ascendant — the zodiac sign that is rising ( due to the rotation of the earth ) on the eastern horizon at the moment of a person 's birth .   Western zodiac signs   Zodiac history and symbolism   While Western astrology is essentially a product of Greco-Roman culture , some of its more basic concepts originated in Babylonia . Isolated references to celestial `` signs '' in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac . Specifically , the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction .   By the 4th century BC , Babylonians ' astronomy and their system of celestial omens were influencing the Greek culture and , by the late 2nd century BC , Egyptian astrology was also mixing in . This resulted , unlike the Mesopotamian tradition , in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of horoscopic astrology , employing the use of the Ascendant ( the rising degree of the ecliptic , at the time of birth ) , and of the twelve houses . Association of the astrological signs with Empedocles ' four classical elements was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs .   The body of astrological knowledge by the 2nd century AD is described in Ptolemy 's Tetrabiblos , a work that was responsible for astrology 's successful spread across Europe and the Middle East , and remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings .   The following table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude , with the Latin names ( still widely used ) and the English translation ( gloss ) . The longitude intervals , being a mathematical division , are closed for the first endpoint ( a ) and open for the second ( b ) — for instance , 30° of longitude is the first point of Taurus , not part of Aries . Association of calendar dates with astrological signs only"], [126, "Dialectic or dialectics ( , dialektikḗ ) , also known as the dialectical method , is a discourse between two or more people holding different points of view about a subject but wishing to establish the truth through reasoned arguments . The term was popularized by Plato 's Socratic dialogues but the act itself has been central to European and Indian philosophy since ancient history .   The term dialectic is not synonymous with the term debate . While in theory debaters are not necessarily emotionally invested in their point of view , in practice debaters frequently display an emotional commitment that may cloud rational judgment . Debates are won through a combination of persuading the opponent , proving one 's argument correct , or proving the opponent 's argument incorrect . Debates do not necessarily require promptly identifying a clear winner or loser ; however clear winners are frequently determined by either a judge , jury , or by group consensus . The term dialectics is also not synonymous with the term rhetoric , a method or art of discourse that seeks to persuade , inform , or motivate an audience . Concepts , like `` logos '' or rational appeal , `` pathos '' or emotional appeal , and `` ethos '' or ethical appeal , are intentionally used by rhetoricians to persuade an audience .   The Sophists taught aretē ( , quality , excellence ) as the highest value , and the determinant of one 's actions in life . The Sophists taught artistic quality in oratory ( motivation via speech ) as a manner of demonstrating one 's aretē . Oratory was taught as an art form , used to please and to influence other people via excellent speech ; nonetheless , the Sophists taught the pupil to seek aretē in all endeavours , not solely in oratory .   Socrates favoured truth as the highest value , proposing that it could be discovered through reason and logic in discussion : ergo , dialectic . Socrates valued rationality ( appealing to logic , not emotion ) as the proper means for persuasion , the discovery of truth , and the determinant for one 's actions . To Socrates , truth , not aretē , was the greater good , and each person should , above all else , seek truth to guide one 's life . Therefore , Socrates opposed the Sophists and their teaching of rhetoric as art and as emotional oratory requiring neither logic nor proof . Different forms of dialectical reasoning have emerged throughout history from the Indosphere ( Greater India ) and the West ( Europe ) . These forms include the Socratic method , Hindu , Buddhist , Medieval , Hegelian dialectics , Marxist , Talmudic , and Neo-orthodoxy .   Principles   The purpose of the dialectic method of reasoning is resolution of disagreement through rational discussion , and , ultimately , the search for truth . One way to proceed—the Socratic method—is to show that a given hypothesis ( with other admissions ) leads to a contradiction ; thus , forcing the withdrawal of the hypothesis as a candidate for truth ( see reductio ad absurdum ) . Another dialectical resolution of disagreement is by denying a presupposition of the contending thesis and antithesis ; thereby , proceeding to sublation ( transcendence ) to synthesis , a third thesis .   Fichtean /Hegelian dialectics is based upon four concepts :  # Everything is transient and finite , existing in the medium of time .  # Everything is composed of contradictions ( opposing forces ) .  # Gradual changes lead to crises , turning points when one force overcomes its opponent force ( quantitative change leads to qualitative change ) .  # Change is helical ( spiral ) , not circular ( negation of the negation ) .   The concept of dialectic ( as a unity of opposites ) existed in the philosophy of Heraclitus of Ephesus , who proposed that everything is in constant change , as a result of inner strife and opposition . Hence , the history of the dialectical method is the history of philosophy.Cassin , Barbara ( ed . ) , Vocabulaire européen des philosophies [ Paris : Le Robert & Seuil , 2004 ] , p. 306 , trans . M.K . Jensen   Western dialectical forms   Classical philosophy   According to Kant , the ancient Greeks used the word `` dialectic '' to signify the logic of false appearance or semblance . To the Ancients , `` it was nothing but the logic of illusion . It was a sophistic art of giving to one 's"], [127, "The aurochs ( or ; pl . aurochs , or rarely aurochsen , aurochses ) , also urus , ure ( Bos primigenius ) , is an extinct type of large wild cattle that inhabited Europe , Asia and North Africa . It is the ancestor of domestic cattle . The species survived in Europe until the last recorded aurochs died in the Jaktorów Forest , Poland in 1627 .   During the Neolithic Revolution , which occurred during the early Holocene , there were at least two aurochs domestication events : one related to the Indian subspecies , leading to zebu cattle ; the other one related to the Eurasian subspecies , leading to taurine cattle . Other species of wild bovines were also domesticated , namely the wild water buffalo , gaur , and banteng . In modern cattle , numerous breeds share characteristics of the aurochs , such as a dark colour in the bulls with a light eel stripe along the back ( the cows being lighter ) , or a typical aurochs-like horn shape .   Taxonomy   The aurochs was variously classified as Bos primigenius , Bos taurus , or , in old sources , Bos urus . However , in 2003 , the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature `` conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species , which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms '' , confirming Bos primigenius for the aurochs . Taxonomists who consider domesticated cattle a subspecies of the wild aurochs should use B. primigenius taurus ; those who consider domesticated cattle to be a separate species may use the name B. taurus , which the Commission has kept available for that purpose .   Etymology   The words aurochs , urus , and wisent have all been used synonymously in English . However , the extinct aurochs/urus is a completely separate species from the still-extant wisent , also known as European bison . The two were often confused , and some 16th-century illustrations of aurochs and wisents have hybrid features .  The word urus ( ; plural uri ) is a Latin word , but was borrowed into Latin from Germanic ( cf . Old English/Old High German ūr , Old Norse úr ) . In German , OHG ūr was compounded with ohso `` ox '' , giving ūrohso , which became early modern Aurochs . The modern form is Auerochse .   The word aurochs was borrowed from early modern German , replacing archaic urochs , also from an earlier form of German . The word is invariable in number in English , though sometimes back-formed singular auroch and innovated plural aurochses occur . The use in English of the plural form ' is nonstandard , but mentioned in The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language . It is directly parallel to the German plural Ochsen ( singular Ochse ) and recreates by analogy the same distinction as English ox ( singular ) and oxen ( plural ) .   Evolution     During the Pliocene , the colder climate caused an extension of open grassland , which led to the evolution of large grazers , such as wild bovines . Bos acutifrons is an extinct species of cattle that has been suggested as an ancestor for the aurochs .   The oldest aurochs remains have been dated to about 2 million years ago , in India . The Indian subspecies was the first to appear . During the Pleistocene , the species migrated west into the Middle East ( western Asia ) as well as to the east . They reached Europe about 270,000 years ago . The South Asian domestic cattle , or zebu , descended from Indian aurochs at the edge of the Thar Desert ; the zebu is resistant to drought . Domestic yak , gayal and banteng do not descend from aurochs .   The first complete mitochondrial genome ( 16,338 base pairs ) DNA sequence analysis of `` Bos primigenius '' from an archaeologically verified and exceptionally well preserved aurochs bone sample was published in 2010 .   Three wild subspecies of aurochs are recognized . Only the Eurasian subspecies survived until recent times .  * The Eurasian aurochs ( Bos primigenius primigenius ) once ranged across the steppes and taigas of Europe , Siberia , and Central Asia , and East Asia . It is noted as part of the Pleistocene megafauna , and declined in numbers along with other megafauna species by the end of Pleistocene . The Eurasian aurochs were domesticated into modern taurine cattle breeds around the 6th millennium BC in the Middle East"], [128, "Tahiti ( ; ) is the largest island in the Windward group of French Polynesia ; this overseas collectivity of the French Republic is sometimes referred to as an overseas country . The island is located in the archipelago of the Society Islands in the central Southern Pacific Ocean , and is divided into two parts : The bigger , northwestern part Tahiti Nui and the smaller , southeastern part Tahiti Iti . The island was formed from volcanic activity and is high and mountainous with surrounding coral reefs . The population is 183,645 inhabitants ( 2012 census ) , making it the most populous island of French Polynesia and accounting for 68.5 % of its total population .   Tahiti is the economic , cultural and political centre of French Polynesia . The capital of the collectivity , Pape'ete , is located on the northwest coast with the only international airport in the region , Fa ' a ' ā International Airport , situated 5 km from the town centre .   Tahiti was originally settled by Polynesians between 300 and 800 CE . They represent about 70 % of the island 's population with the rest made up of Europeans , Chinese and those of mixed heritage .   The island was part of the Kingdom of Tahiti until its annexation by France in 1880 , when it was proclaimed a colony of France . It was not until 1946 that the indigenous Tahitians were legally authorised to be French citizens . French is the only official language although the Tahitian language ( Reo Tahiti ) is widely spoken .   Geography   Tahiti is the highest and largest island in French Polynesia lying close to Moorea island . It is located 4400 km south of Hawaii , 7900 km from Chile and 5700 km from Australia .   The island is 45 km across at its widest point and covers an area of 1045 km2 . The highest peak is Mont Orohena ( Mou ' a 'Orohena ) ( 2241 m ) . Mount Roonui , or Mount Ronui ( Mou ' a Rōnui ) in the southeast rises to 1332 m. The island consists of two roughly round portions centred on volcanic mountains and connected by a short isthmus named after the small town of Taravao , situated there .   The northwestern portion is known as Tahiti Nui ( `` big Tahiti '' ) , while the much smaller southeastern portion is known as Tahiti Iti ( `` small Tahiti '' ) or Tai'arapū . Tahiti Nui is heavily populated along the coast , especially around the capital , Papeete .   The interior of Tahiti Nui is almost entirely uninhabited . Tahiti Iti has remained isolated , as its southeastern half ( Te Pari ) is accessible only to those travelling by boat or on foot . The rest of the island is encircled by a main road which cuts between the mountains and the sea .   A scenic and winding interior road climbs past dairy farms and citrus groves with panoramic views . Tahiti 's landscape features lush rainforests and many streams , including the Papenoo River on the north side .   Climate   November to April is the wet season , the wettest month of which is January with of rain in Papeetē . August is the driest with .   The average temperature ranges between 21 and with little seasonal variation . The lowest and highest temperatures recorded in Papeete are 16 and , respectively .   History   Prehistoric colonization of Tahiti   The first Tahitians arrived from Southeast Asia in about 200 BCE , after a long migration from South East Asia or Indonesia , via the Fijian , Samoan and Tongan Archipelagos . This hypothesis of an emigration from Southeast Asia is supported by a number of linguistic , biological and archaeological proofs . For example , the languages of Fiji and Polynesia all belong to the same Oceanic sub-group , Fijian-Polynesian , which itself forms part of the great family of the Austronesian Languages .   This emigration , across several hundred kilometres of ocean , was made possible by using outrigger canoes that were up to twenty or thirty meters long and could transport families as well as domestic animals . In 1769 , for instance , James Cook mentions a great traditional ship ( va ' a ) in Tahiti that was 33 m long , and could be propelled by sail or paddles .  In 2010 , an expedition on a simple outrigger canoe with a sail retraced the route back from Tahiti to Asia"], [129, "Robert Devereux , 2nd Earl of Essex , KG PC ( ; 10 November 1565 – 25 February 1601 ) was an English nobleman and a favourite of Elizabeth I . Politically ambitious , and a committed general , he was placed under house arrest following a poor campaign in Ireland during the Nine Years ' War in 1599 . In 1601 , he led an abortive coup d'état against the government and was executed for treason . He is an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth II .   Early life   Essex was born on 10 November 1565 at Netherwood near Bromyard , in Herefordshire , the son of Walter Devereux , 1st Earl of Essex , and Lettice Knollys . His maternal great-grandmother Mary Boleyn was a sister of Anne Boleyn , the mother of Queen Elizabeth I , making him a first-cousin-twice-removed of the Queen .   He was brought up on his father 's estates at Chartley Castle , Staffordshire , and at Lamphey , Pembrokeshire , in Wales . His father died in 1576 , and the new Earl of Essex became a ward of Lord Burghley . In 1577 , he was admitted as a fellow-commoner at Trinity College , Cambridge ; in 1579 , he matriculated ; and in 1581 he graduated as Master of Arts .   On 21 September 1578 , Essex 's mother married Robert Dudley , Earl of Leicester , Elizabeth I 's long-standing favourite and Robert Devereux 's godfather .   Essex performed military service under his stepfather in the Netherlands , before making an impact at court and winning the Queen 's favour . In 1590 , he married Frances Walsingham , daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham and widow of Sir Philip Sidney , by whom he was to have several children , three of whom survived into adulthood . Sidney , Leicester 's nephew , died in 1586 at the Battle of Zutphen in which Essex also distinguished himself . In October 1591 , Devereux 's mistress , Elizabeth Southwell , gave birth to a son who survived into adulthood .   Court and military career   Essex first came to court in 1584 , and by 1587 had become a favourite of the Queen , who relished his lively mind and eloquence , as well as his skills as a showman and in courtly love . In June 1587 he replaced the Earl of Leicester as Master of the Horse . After Leicester 's death in 1588 , the Queen transferred the late Earl 's royal monopoly on sweet wines to Essex , providing him with revenue from taxes . In 1593 , he was made a member of her Privy Council .   Essex underestimated the Queen , however , and his later behaviour towards her lacked due respect and showed disdain for the influence of her principal secretary , Robert Cecil . On one occasion during a heated Privy Council debate on the problems in Ireland , the Queen reportedly cuffed an insolent Essex round the ear , prompting him to half draw his sword on her .   In 1589 , he took part in Francis Drake 's English Armada , which sailed to Spain in an unsuccessful attempt to press home the English advantage following the defeat of the Spanish Armada , although the Queen had ordered him not to take part in the expedition . In 1591 , he was given command of a force sent to the assistance of King Henry IV of France . In 1596 , he distinguished himself by the capture of Cadiz . During the Islands Voyage expedition to the Azores in 1597 , with Walter Raleigh as his second in command , he defied the Queen 's orders , pursuing the treasure fleet without first defeating the Spanish battle fleet .   When the Spanish fleet appeared off the English coast during the 3rd Spanish Armada in the Autumn of 1597 panic then ensued because the English fleet had been far out to sea with the coast virtually undefended . This further depleted the relationship between the Queen and Essex even though initially he was put in charge of the fleet to face the Spanish threat .   Ireland   Essex 's greatest failure was as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland , a post which he talked himself into in 1599 . The Nine Years War ( 1595–1603 ) was in its middle stages , and no English commander had been successful . More military force was required to defeat the Irish chieftains , led by Hugh O'Neill , the Earl of Tyrone and supplied from Spain and Scotland .

A small part of Belgium is also drained by the Moselle through the Sauer and the Our .   The Moselle `` twists and turns its way between Trier and Koblenz along one of Germany 's most beautiful river valleys . `` [ http : //www.romantic-germany.info/Moselle.4106.0.html Moselle : Holidays in one of Germany 's most beautiful river valleys ] at www.romantic-germany.info . Retrieved 23 Jan 2016 . It flows through a region that has been influenced by mankind since it was first cultivated by the Romans . Today , its hillsides are covered by terraced vineyards where `` some of the best Rieslings grow '' , and numerous ruined castles dominate the hilltops above wine villages and towns that line the riverbanks . Traben-Trarbach with its art nouveau architecture and Bernkastel-Kues with its traditional market square are two of the many popular tourist attractions on the Moselle river .   Name   The name Moselle is derived from the Celtic name form , Moseal , via the Latin Mosella , a diminutive form of Mosa , the Latin description of the Meuse , which used to flow parallel to the Moselle . So the Mosella was the `` Little Meuse '' .   The Moselle is first recorded by Tacitus in Book 13 of his Annals and in Book 4 of his Histories .   The Roman poet , Decimius Magnus Ausonius , made it a literary theme as early as the 4th century . In his poem dated A.D. 371 , called Mosella , which was published in 483 hexameters , this poet of the Late Antiquity and teacher at the Trier Imperial Court ( Kaiserhof ) described a journey from Bingen over the Hunsrück hills to the Moselle and then following its course to Trier on the road named after him , the Via Ausonius . Ausonius describes flourishing and rich landscapes along the river and in the valley of the Moselle , thanks to the policies of their Roman rulers .   The river subsequently gave its name to two French republican départements : Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle .   Geography   The source of the Moselle is at 715 metres above sea level on the Col de Bussang on the western slopes of the Ballon d'Alsace in the Vosges . After 544 kilometres it discharges into the Rhine at the Deutsches Eck in Koblenz at a height of 59 metres above NHN . The length of the river in France is 314 kilometres , for 39 kilometres it forms the border between Germany and Luxembourg , and 208 kilometres are solely within Germany .   The Moselle flows through the Lorraine region , west of the Vosges . Further downstream , in Germany , the Moselle valley forms the division between the Eifel and Hunsrück mountain regions .   The average flow rate of the Moselle at its mouth is 328 m³/s , Hydrologischer Atlas der Schweiz 2002 , Tab . 5.4 Natürliche Abflüsse 1961-1980 ( natural discharges ) ( [ http : //www.hydrologie.unibe.ch/hades/hades/tafel_54.html see map ] ) making it the second largest tributary of the Rhine by volume after the Aare ( 560 m³/s ) and bigger than the Main and Neckar .   River sections   The section of the Moselle from the Franco-German-Luxembourg tripoint to its confluence with the Saar near Konz shortly before Trier is in Germany known ( geographically incorrectly ) as the Upper Moselle . The section from Trier to Pünderich is the Middle Moselle , the section between Pünderich and its mouth in Koblenz as the Lower Moselle or Terraced Moselle ( Terrassenmosel ) . Characteristic of the Middle and Lower Moselle are its wide meanders cut deeply into the highlands of the Rhenish Massif , the most striking of which is the Cochemer Krampen between Bremm and Cochem . Also typical are its vineyard terraces .   From the tripoint the Moselle marks the entire Saarland-Luxembourg .   Catchment   The catchment area of the Moselle is 28,286 km² in area . The French part covers 15,360 km² , about 54 percent of the entire catchment . The German state of Rhineland-Palatinate has 6,980 km² , the Saarland 2,569 km² , Luxembourg 2,521 km² , Wallonia ( Belgium ) 767 km² and North Rhine-Westphalia , 88 km² .

( often referred to as Warner Bros. Pictures , Warner Bros. or just simply WB ) is an American entertainment company . As one of the major film studios , it is a division of Time Warner , with its headquarters in Burbank , California . Warner Bros. has several subsidiary companies , including Warner Bros. Pictures , Turner Entertainment Co. , Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment , Warner Bros. Television , Warner Bros . Animation , Warner Home Video , New Line Cinema , Castle Rock Entertainment , and DC Entertainment . Warner Bros. owns half of The CW Television Network .   History   Founding   The company 's name originates from the four founding Warner brothers ( born Wonskolaser or Wonsal before Anglicization ) : Harry , Albert , Sam , and Jack Warner . They emigrated as small children with their parents to Canada from Krasnosielc which was located in the part of Congress Poland that had been subjugated to the Russian Empire following the eighteenth-century Partitions of Poland near present-day Ostrołęka .   Jack , the youngest , was born in London , Ontario . The three elder brothers began in the movie theater business , having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of Pennsylvania and Ohio . In the beginning , Sam and Albert Warner invested $ 150 to present Life of an American Fireman and The Great Train Robbery . They opened their first theater , the Cascade , in New Castle , Pennsylvania , in 1903 .   When the original building was in danger of being demolished , the modern Warner Bros. called the current building owners , and arranged to save it . The owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance .   In 1904 , the Warners founded the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement & Supply Company , to distribute films . In 1912 , Harry Warner hired an auditor named Paul Ashley Chase . By the time of World War I they had begun producing films . In 1918 they opened the first Warner Bros. studio on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood . Sam and Jack produced the pictures , while Harry and Albert , along with their auditor and now controller Chase , handled finance and distribution in New York City . During World War I their first nationally syndicated film , My Four Years in Germany , based on a popular book by former ambassador James W. Gerard , was released . On April 4 , 1923 , with help from money loaned to Harry by his banker Motley Flint , they formally incorporated as Warner Brothers Pictures , Incorporated . ( As late as the 1960s , Warner Bros. claimed 1905 as its founding date . )   The first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to Avery Hopwood 's 1919 Broadway play , The Gold Diggers , from theatrical impresario David Belasco . However , Rin Tin Tin , a dog brought from France after World War I by an American soldier , established their reputation . Rin Tin Tin debuted in the feature Where the North Begins . The movie was so successful that Jack signed the dog to star in more films for $ 1,000 per week . Rin Tin Tin became the studio 's top star . Jack nicknamed him `` The Mortgage Lifter '' and the success boosted Darryl F. Zanuck 's career . Zanuck eventually became a top producer and between 1928 and 1933 served as Jack 's right-hand man and executive producer , with responsibilities including day-to-day film production . More success came after Ernst Lubitsch was hired as head director ; Harry Rapf left the studio to join Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.Thomas46 , 47 Lubitsch 's film The Marriage Circle was the studio 's most successful film of 1924 , and was on The New York Times best list for that year .   Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and Lubitsch , Warner 's remained a lesser studio . Sam and Jack decided to offer Broadway actor John Barrymore the lead role in Beau Brummel . The film was so successful that Harry signed Barrymore to a long-term contract ; like The Marriage Circle , Beau Brummell was named one of the ten best films of the year by the Times . By the end of 1924 , Warner Bros. was arguably Hollywood 's most successful independent studio , where it competed with `` The Big Three '' Studios ( First National , Paramount Pictures , and MGM ) .

Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government , Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside . State citizenship and residency are flexible , and no government approval is required to move between states , except for persons covered by certain types of court orders ( e.g. , paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody ) .   States range in population from just under 600,000 ( Wyoming ) to over 38 million ( California ) , and in area from ( Rhode Island ) to ( Alaska ) . Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names .   States are divided into counties or county-equivalents , which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign . County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state . State governments are allocated power by the people ( of each respective state ) through their individual constitutions . All are grounded in republican principles , and each provides for a government , consisting of three branches : executive , legislative , and judicial .   States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution ; among them ratifying constitutional amendments . Historically , the tasks of local law enforcement , public education , public health , regulating intrastate commerce , and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities , although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well . Over time , the U.S. Constitution has been amended , and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed . The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation , with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did . There is a continuing debate over states ' rights , which concerns the extent and nature of the states ' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals .   States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress , a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives . Each state is represented by two Senators , and at least one Representative , while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census . Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College , the body that elects the President of the United States , equal to the total of Representatives and Senators from that state .   The Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union . Since the establishment of the United States in 1776 , the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50 . Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted , both in 1959 .   The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede ( withdraw from ) from the Union . Shortly after the Civil War , the U.S. Supreme Court , in Texas v. White , held that a state can not unilaterally do so .   States of the United States   The 50 U.S. states ( in alphabetical order ) , along with state flag and date each joined the union :   Governments   As each state is itself a sovereign entity , it reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way ( within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution ) deemed appropriate by its people . As a result , while the governments of the various states share many similar features , they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance . No two state governments are identical .   Constitutions   The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution . Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart . The Constitution of Alabama , for example , contains 310,296 words — more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution . In practice , each state has adopted a three-branch system of government , modeled after the federal government , and consisting of three branches ( although the three-branch structure is not required ) : executive , legislative , and judicial .   Executive   In each state , the chief executive is called the"], [133, "Blasphemy is the act of insulting or showing contempt or lack of reverence to a deity , to religious or holy persons or sacred things , or toward something considered sacred or inviolable .

One of the world 's best-selling artists of all time , Adams in his more than thirty five-year career has sold 100 million records and singles worldwide . Adams rose to fame in North America with his 1983 album Cuts Like a Knife and turned into a global star with his 1984 album Reckless which produced some of his best known songs including `` Run to You '' and `` Summer of '69 '' . In 1991 , he released `` ( Everything I Do ) I Do It for You '' , one of the best-selling singles of all time . Adams also spawned the U.S . Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles `` Heaven '' , `` All for Love '' and `` Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman ? `` .   For his contributions to music , Adams has garnered many awards and nominations , including 20 Juno Awards among 56 nominations , 15 Grammy Award nominations including a win for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television in 1992 . He has also won MTV , ASCAP , American Music awards , three Ivor Novello Awards for song composition and has been nominated five times for Golden Globe Awards and three times for Academy Awards for his songwriting for films .   Adams was awarded the Order of Canada and the Order of British Columbia for contributions to popular music and philanthropic work via his own foundation , which helps improve education for people around the world .   Adams was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March 2011 and Canada 's Walk of Fame , Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame in 1998. , and in April 2006 he was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at Canada 's Juno Awards . In 2008 , Adams was ranked 38th on the list of All-Time top artists in the Billboard Hot 100 50th Anniversary Charts . On 13 January 2010 , he received the Allan Waters Humanitarian Award for his part in numerous charitable concerts and campaigns during his career , and on 1 May 2010 was given the Governor General 's Performing Arts Award for his 30 years of contributions to the arts .   Life and career   Early life   Adams was born in Kingston , Ontario , Canada , to British parents , Elizabeth Jane ( née Watson ) and Captain Conrad J. Adams , who immigrated to Canada from Plymouth , England in the 1950s . Adams ' father , a Sandhurst officer in the British Army , joined the Canadian Army and later spent time as a United Nations peacekeeping observer for Canada , which led to him becoming a Canadian foreign service diplomat . Adams travelled with his parents to diplomatic postings in Portugal ( where he attended the American International School of Lisbon ) and Vienna , Austria , during the 1960s , and to Israel during the early 1970s . Adams has a brother , Bruce .   Early career   By 17 , Adams had started working in the Vancouver studio scene , working as a background vocalist for the CBC and backing local artists and with Motown keyboardist Robbie King , whom Adams attributes as having given him his first salaried session . Prior to that at age 15-16 he fronted various pub bands like Sweeney Todd that released `` If Wishes Were Horses '' and was often seen sitting in with other cover bands . He and his guitarist Keith Scott met during those club years and still work together today .   In 1978 , at 18 , Adams met Jim Vallance through a mutual friend in a Vancouver music store . Vallance was the former drummer and principal songwriter for Vancouver-based rock band Prism and had recently quit that band to focus on a career as a studio musician and songwriter . They agreed to meet at Vallance 's home studio a few days later , which proved to be the beginning of a partnership which still exists in 2016 . Later in 1978 , Adams signed to A & M records for one dollar . Some of the first demos written in 1978 have surfaced over the years , most notably `` I 'm Ready '' ( recorded for both the album Cuts Like a Knife and later his release for MTV Unplugged ) and `` Remember , '' which was recorded on his first album . Both songs were covered by other artists even before his first album"], [135, "Dr. Finlay is a fictional character , the hero of a series of stories by Scottish author A. J. Cronin .   History   The stories were used as the basis for the long-running BBC television programme Dr. Finlay 's Casebook , screened from 1962 to 1971 , and radio series of the same name ( 1970–78 ) . Based on Cronin 's novella entitled Country Doctor , the storylines centred on Dr. Finlay 's general medical practice in the fictional Scottish town of Tannochbrae during the late 1920s . The main characters were Dr. Finlay , a junior partner in the practice , played by Bill Simpson , Dr. Cameron , the craggy senior partner , played by Andrew Cruickshank , and Janet , their unflappable housekeeper and receptionist at Arden House , played by Barbara Mullen . Dr. Finlay returned to television with the ITV series , Doctor Finlay , continuing the stories into the late 1940s , which featured David Rintoul as Dr. Finlay , Ian Bannen as Dr. Cameron , and Annette Crosbie as Janet . It later aired in the U.S. on PBS ' Masterpiece Theatre .   Character   In the books , Dr Finlay worked alone . He was charming and became well-acquainted with his patients over many years .

The European , or metropolitan , area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . France spans 643801 km2 and has a total population of 66.7 million . It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . The area was annexed in 51 BC by Rome , which held Gaul until 486 , when the Germanic Franks conquered the region and formed the Kingdom of France .   France emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , with its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337 to 1453 ) strengthening state-building and political centralization . During the Renaissance , French culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established , which by the 20th century would be the second largest in the world . The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants ( Huguenots ) . France became Europe 's dominant cultural , political , and military power under Louis XIV . In the late 18th century , the French Revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy , established one of modern history 's earliest republics , and saw the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , which expresses the nation 's ideals to this day .   In the 19th century Napoleon took power and established the First French Empire , whose subsequent Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of continental Europe . Following the collapse of the Empire , France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the French Third Republic in 1870 . France was a major participant in the First World War , from which it emerged victorious , and was one of the Allied Powers in the Second World War , but came under occupation by the Axis Powers in 1940 . Following liberation in 1944 , a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War . The Fifth Republic , led by Charles de Gaulle , was formed in 1958 and remains to this day . Algeria and the colonies in Indochina became independent in the 1950s after long , bloody wars . Nearly all the other colonies became independent in the 1960s with minimal controversy and typically retained close economic and military connections with France .   France has long been a global center of art , science , and philosophy . It hosts Europe 's third-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites ( after Italy and Spain ) and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually , the most of any country in the world . France is a developed country with the world 's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest by purchasing power parity . In terms of aggregate household wealth , it ranks fourth in the world . France performs well in international rankings of education , health care , life expectancy , and human development . France remains a great power in the world , being a founding member of the United Nations , where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council , and a founding and leading member state of the European Union ( EU ) . It is also a member of the Group of 7 , North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , and La Francophonie .   Etymology   Originally applied to the whole Frankish Empire , the name `` France '' comes from the Latin ' , or `` country of the Franks '' . Modern France is still named today Francia in Italian and Spanish , Frankreich in German and Frankrijk in Dutch , all of which have the same historical meaning .   There are various theories as to the origin of the name Frank . Following the precedents of Edward Gibbon and Jacob Grimm , the name of the Franks has been linked with the word frank ( free ) in English . It has been suggested that the meaning of `` free '' was adopted because , after the conquest of Gaul , only Franks were free of taxation ."], [137, "The terms ' ( AD or A.D. ) and before Christ ( BC or B.C . ) are used to label or number years in the Julian and Gregorian calendars . The term ' is Medieval Latin , which means in the year of the Lord but is often translated as in the year of our Lord . It is occasionally set out more fully as ' ( or Jesu ) ' ( `` in the year of Our Lord Jesus Christ '' ) .  Dionysius Exiguus of Scythia Minor introduced the AD system in AD 525 , counting the years since the birth of Christ .   This calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth , with AD counting years from the start of this epoch , and BC denoting years before the start of the era . There is no year zero in this scheme , so the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1 BC . This dating system was devised in 525 , but was not widely used until after 800 .   The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today . For decades , it has been the unofficial global standard , adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication , transportation , and commercial integration , and recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations .   Traditionally , English followed Latin usage by placing the `` AD '' abbreviation before the year number . However , BC is placed after the year number ( for example : AD , but 68 BC ) , which also preserves syntactic order . The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium , as in `` fourth century AD '' or `` second millennium AD '' ( although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions ) . Because BC is the English abbreviation for Before Christ , it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means After Death , i.e. , after the death of Jesus . However , this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would not be included in either of the BC and the AD time scales .   Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current , or Common Era ( abbreviated as CE or C.E . ) , with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common , Christian , or Current Era ( BCE or B.C.E . ) . Astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity , but use the same numbers for AD years .   History   The Anno Domini dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus to enumerate the years in his Easter table . His system was to replace the Diocletian era that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians . The last year of the old table , Diocletian 247 , was immediately followed by the first year of his table , AD 532 . When he devised his table , Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year—he himself stated that the `` present year '' was `` the consulship of Probus Junior '' , which was 525 years `` since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ '' . Thus Dionysius implied that Jesus ' Incarnation occurred 525 years earlier , without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred . `` However , nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system , whether consulate , Olympiad , year of the world , or regnal year of Augustus ; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date . ''   Blackburn & Holford-Strevens briefly present arguments for 2 BC , 1 BC , or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the Nativity or Incarnation . Among the sources of confusion are :  * In modern times , Incarnation is synonymous with the conception , but some ancient writers , such as Bede , considered Incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity  * The civil , or consular year began on 1 January but the Diocletian year began on 29 August ( 30 August in the year before a Julian leap year ) .  * There were inaccuracies in the list of consuls  * There were confused summations of emperors ' regnal years"], [138, "A drag queen is a person , usually male , who dresses in drag and often acts with exaggerated femininity and in feminine gender roles . Often they will exaggerate certain characteristics such as make-up and eyelashes for comic , dramatic , or satirical effect . While drag is very much associated with gay men and gay culture , there are drag artists of all sexualities and genders . There are many kinds of drag artists and they vary greatly in dedication , from professionals who have starred in films to people who just try it once , or those who simply prefer clothing and makeup that is usually worn by the opposite sex in their culture . Drag queens can vary widely by class and culture . Other drag performers include drag kings , women who perform in male roles and attire , faux queens , who are women who dress in an exaggerated style to emulate drag queens , and faux kings , who are men who dress to impersonate drag kings .   There are many reasons people do drag including self-expression , comfort , transvestic fetishism , and spiritual reasons , as well as the higher-profile performing and entertaining . Drag can be a creative outlet , a means of self-exploration , and a way to make cultural statements . While the general public may be most familiar with the `` high drag '' of professional performance artists , drag is also part of regular life and street culture for many gender-nonconforming or gender-variant people , who may or may not consider what they do , `` drag . '' Drag queen activities among stage and street performers may include lip-synching performances , live singing , dancing , participating in events such as gay pride parades , drag pageants , or at venues such as cabarets and discotheques . Some drag artists also engage in mix-and-mingle or hosting work in night clubs , such as drag bingo , and at private parties and events . Famous drag queens include Divine , Dame Edna Everage , Lily Savage , Lady Bunny , RuPaul , Bianca Del Rio , Raven ( drag queen ) , Raja Gemini , Jinkx Monsoon , Sharon Needles , Willam , Violet Chachki , Alyssa Edwards , Shangela Laquifa Wadley , Manila Luzon , Courtney Act , Pearl Liaison , Jackie Beat , Adore Delano , Tyra Sanchez , Trixie Mattel , Katya Zamolodchikova , Naomi Smalls , Kim Chi , Bob the Drag Queen , Thorgy Thor , Acid Betty , Conchita Wurst .   Terminology   Drag queen   The etymology of the term `` drag queen '' is disputed . The term drag queen occurred in Polari , a subset of English slang that was popular in some gay communities in the early part of the 20th century . Its first recorded use to refer to actors dressed in women 's clothing is from 1870 .   A folk etymology is that drag is an acronym of `` Dressed Resembling A Girl '' in description of male theatrical transvestism .   Queen may refer to the trait of affected royalty found in the personalities of many who do drag ( whether this is their normal personality or a character created for the stage ) . It is also related to the Old English word `` quean '' or cwene , which originally simply meant `` woman '' , then was later used as a label both for promiscuous women and gay men ( see Oxford English Dictionary definition number 3 for `` queen '' ) .  The OE word apprears derived from  Middle Dutch quene ( `` old woman '' ) , ultimately from  Proto-Germanic * kwenǭ ( `` woman '' ) , from Proto-Indo-European * gʷḗn ( `` woman '' ) .   Drag as a term referring to women 's clothing worn by men has less clear origins . According to one theory , it was used in reference to transvestites at least as early as the 18th century , owing to the tendency of their skirts to drag on the ground . Another possibility is that it derives from the Romani word for skirt , which appears in a number of Romani dialects of Northern Europe with forms like daraka and jendraka .   Female impersonator   Another term for a drag queen , female impersonator , is still used—though it is sometimes regarded as inaccurate , because not all contemporary drag performers are attempting to pass as women . Female impersonation has been and continues to be illegal in some places , which inspired the drag queen José Sarria to hand out labels to"], [139, "No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American neo-Western thriller film directed , written , and edited by Joel and Ethan Coen , based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name . Starring Tommy Lee Jones , Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin , it tells the story of a Texas welder and Vietnam veteran to whom chance and greed deliver a fate that is neither wanted nor denied ; a cat-and-mouse drama set in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas . Themes of fate , conscience , and circumstance are explored ; ones that the Coen brothers have previously explored in Blood Simple and Fargo .   The film premiered in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on May 19 . It won four awards at the 80th Academy Awards – Best Picture , Best Director , Best Supporting Actor ( Bardem ) and Best Adapted Screenplay , allowing the Coen brothers to join four previous directors honored three times for a single film . In addition , the film won three British Academy Film Awards ( BAFTA ) including Best Director , and two Golden Globes . The American Film Institute listed it as an AFI Movie of the Year , and the National Board of Review selected the film as the best of 2007 .   More critics included No Country for Old Men on their 2007 top ten lists than any other film , and many regard it as the Coen brothers ' masterpiece , as well as one of the best films of the 2000s . The Guardians John Patterson said `` the Coens ' technical abilities , and their feel for a landscape-based Western classicism reminiscent of Anthony Mann and Sam Peckinpah , are matched by few living directors '' , and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that it is `` a new career peak for the Coen brothers '' and `` as entertaining as hell '' .   Plot   Terrell County , Texas in June 1980 is desolate , expansive country , and Ed Tom Bell ( Tommy Lee Jones ) laments the increasing violence in a region where he , like his father and grandfather before him , has risen to the office of sheriff . In a neighboring county , Anton Chigurh ( Javier Bardem ) , a hitman , strangles a sheriff 's deputy to escape custody and steals a car by using a captive bolt pistol to kill the driver .

Moss has rented a second room adjacent to the Mexicans ' room with access to the same vent in which the money is hidden . He retrieves the briefcase just before Chigurh opens the vent and finds it empty .   While staying at a hotel in Eagle Pass , Moss discovers the tracking device , but Chigurh has already found him . Their firefight spills onto the streets and both are wounded . Moss flees to Mexico where he collapses and is helped to a hospital .

It is one of the communities , regions and language areas of Belgium . The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming , while the corresponding adjective is Flemish . The official capital of Flanders is Brussels , although Brussels itself has an independent regional government , and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life .   Historically , the name referred to the County of Flanders ( Flandria ) , which around AD 1000 stretched from the Strait of Dover to the Scheldt estuary . The only parts of historical Flanders situated within modern-day Flanders are the provinces West Flanders and East Flanders . Nevertheless , during the 19th and 20th centuries it became increasingly commonplace to use the term `` Flanders '' to refer to the entire Dutch-speaking part of Belgium , stretching all the way to the River Maas . In accordance with late 20th century Belgian state reforms the area was made into two political entities : the `` Flemish Community '' ( ) and the `` Flemish Region '' ( ) . These entities were merged , although geographically the Flemish Community , which has a broader cultural mandate , covers Brussels , whereas the Flemish Region does not .   Flanders has figured prominently in European history . During the late Middle Ages , cities such as Ghent , Bruges , Antwerp and Brussels made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe , weaving the wool of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export . As a consequence , a very sophisticated culture developed , with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture , rivaling those of northern Italy . Belgium was one of the centres of the 19th century industrial revolution but Flanders was at first overtaken by French-speaking Wallonia . In the second half of the 20th century , however , Flanders ' economy modernised rapidly , and today Flanders is significantly more wealthy than its southern counterpart .   Geographically , Flanders is generally flat , and has a small section of coast on the North Sea . Much of Flanders is agriculturally fertile and densely populated , with a population density of almost 500 people per square kilometer ( 1,200 per square mile ) . It borders France to the west , the Netherlands to the north and east , and Wallonia to the south . The Brussels Capital Region is an enclave within the Flemish Region . Flanders has exclaves of its own : Voeren in the east is between Wallonia and the Netherlands and Baarle-Hertog in the north consists of 22 exclaves surrounded by the Netherlands .   Terminology   In Belgium   The term `` Flanders '' has several main meanings :  * The `` Flemish community '' or `` Flemish nation '' , i.e . the social , cultural and linguistic , scientific and educational , economical and political community of the Flemings . It comprises 6.5 million Belgians ( 60 % ) who consider Dutch to be their mother tongue .  * The political subdivisions of Belgium : the Flemish Region ( competent in mainly economic matters ) and the Flemish Community ( competent in mainly cultural matters ) . The first does not comprise Brussels ( which forms a Region on itself ) , whereas the latter does .  * The political institutions that govern both subdivisions : the operative body `` Flemish Government '' and the legislative organ `` Flemish Parliament '' .  * The two westernmost provinces of the Flemish Region , West Flanders and East Flanders , forming the central portion of the historic County of Flanders .   In Belgium and neighbouring countries   * A feudal territory that existed from the 8th century ( Flandria ) until its absorption by the French First Republic . Until the 1600s , this county also extended over parts of France and the Netherlands .  * One of the regions conquered by the French in Flanders , namely French Flanders in the Nord department . French Flanders can be divided into two smaller regions : Lilloise Flanders and Maritime Flanders . The first region was predominantly French-speaking already in the 1600s , the latter became so in the 20th century . The city of Lille identifies itself as `` Flemish '' , and this is reflected , for instance , in the name of its local railway station TGV Lille Flandres .  * The region conquered by the Dutch Republic in Flanders , now part of the Dutch province of"], [141, "The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred at 00:58:53 UTC on 26 December with the epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra , Indonesia . The shock had a moment magnitude of 9.1–9.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX ( Violent ) . The undersea megathrust earthquake was caused when the Indian Plate was subducted by the Burma Plate and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean , killing 230,000 people in 14 countries , and inundating coastal communities with waves up to 30 m high . It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history . Indonesia was the hardest-hit country , followed by Sri Lanka , India , and Thailand .   It is the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph and had the longest duration of faulting ever observed , between 8.3 and 10 minutes . It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1 cm and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska . Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia . The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response . In all , the worldwide community donated more than US $ 14 billion ( 2004 ) in humanitarian aid . The event is known by the scientific community as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake . The resulting tsunami was given various names , including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , South Asian tsunami , Indonesian tsunami , the Christmas tsunami and the Boxing Day tsunami .   Earthquake characteristics   The earthquake was initially documented as moment magnitude 8.8 . In February 2005 scientists revised the estimate of the magnitude to 9.0 . Although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has accepted these new numbers , the United States Geological Survey has so far not changed its estimate of 9.1 . The most recent studies in 2006 have obtained a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3 . Dr. Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology believes that Mw 9.2 is a good representative value for the size of this great earthquake .   The hypocentre of the main earthquake was approximately 160 km off the western coast of northern Sumatra , in the Indian Ocean just north of Simeulue island at a depth of 30 km below mean sea level ( initially reported as 10 km ) . The northern section of the Sunda megathrust ruptured over a length of 1300 km . The earthquake ( followed by the tsunami ) was felt simultaneously in Bangladesh , India , Malaysia , Myanmar , Thailand , Singapore and the Maldives . Splay faults , or secondary `` pop up faults '' , caused long , narrow parts of the sea floor to pop up in seconds . This quickly elevated the height and increased the speed of waves , causing the complete destruction of the nearby Indonesian town of Lhoknga .   Indonesia lies between the Pacific Ring of Fire along the north-eastern islands adjacent to New Guinea , and the Alpide belt that runs along the south and west from Sumatra , Java , Bali , Flores to Timor .   Great earthquakes such as the Sumatra-Andaman event , which are invariably associated with megathrust events in subduction zones , have seismic moments that can account for a significant fraction of the global earthquake moment across century-scale time periods . Of all the seismic moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005 , roughly one-eighth was due to the Sumatra-Andaman event . This quake , together with the Good Friday earthquake ( Alaska , 1964 ) and the Great Chilean earthquake ( 1960 ) , account for almost half of the total moment . The much smaller but still catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake is included in the diagram for perspective . Mw denotes the magnitude of an earthquake on the moment magnitude scale .   Since 1900 the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake ( magnitude 9.5 ) and the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Prince William Sound ( 9.2 ) . The only other recorded earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater were off Kamchatka , Russia , on 4 November 1952 ( magnitude 9.0 ) and Tōhoku , Japan ( magnitude 9.0 ) in March 2011 . Each of these megathrust earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean . However , the death toll from these was significantly lower , primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas and the much greater distances to more populated coasts and also due to the superior infrastructure and warning systems in MEDCs ( More Economically"], [142, "At the Battle of Omdurman ( 2 September 1898 ) , an army commanded by the British General Sir Herbert Kitchener defeated the army of Abdullah al-Taashi , the successor to the self-proclaimed Mahdi , Muhammad Ahmad . Kitchener was seeking revenge for the death of General Gordon in 1884 . It was a demonstration of the superiority of a highly disciplined army equipped with modern rifles , machine guns and artillery over a force twice their size armed with older weapons , and marked the success of British efforts to re-conquer the Sudan . However , it was not until the 1899 Battle of Umm Diwaykarat that the final Mahdist forces were defeated .   Omdurman is today a suburb of Khartoum in central Sudan , with a population of some 1.5 million . The village of Omdurman was chosen in 1884 as the base of operations by the Mahdi , Muhammad Ahmad . After his death in 1885 , following the successful siege of Khartoum , his successor ( Khalifa ) Abdullah retained it as his capital .   Battle account   The battle took place at Kerreri , 11 km north of Omdurman . Kitchener commanded a force of 8,000 British regulars and a mixed force of 17,000 Sudanese and Egyptian troops . He arrayed his force in an arc around the village of Egeiga , close to the bank of the Nile , where a twelve gunboat flotilla waited in support , facing a wide , flat plain with hills rising to the left and right . The British and Egyptian cavalry were placed on either flank .   Abdullah 's followers , known as Ansar and sometimes referred to as Dervishes , numbered around 50,000 , including some 3,000 cavalry . They were split into five groups—a force of 8,000 under Osman Azrak was arrayed directly opposite the British , in a shallow arc along a mile ( 1.6 km ) of a low ridge leading onto the plain , and the other Mahdist forces were initially concealed from Kitchener 's force . Abdullah al-Taashi and 17,000 men were concealed behind the Surgham Hills to the west and rear of Osman Azrak 's force , with 20,000 more positioned to the north-west , close to the front behind the Kerreri hills , commanded by Ali-Wad-Helu and Sheikh ed-Din . A final force of around 8,000 was gathered on the slope on the right flank of Azrak 's force .   The battle began in the early morning , at around 6:00 a.m. After the clashes of the previous day , the 8,000 men under Osman Azrak advanced straight at the waiting British , quickly followed by about 8,000 of those waiting to the northwest , a mixed force of rifle and spear-men . The 52 quick firing guns of the British artillery opened fire at around 2750 m , inflicting severe casualties on the Mahdist forces before they even came within range of the Maxim guns and volley fire . The frontal attack ended quickly , with around 4,000 Mahdist casualties ; none of the attackers got closer than 50 m to the British trenches . A flanking move from the Ansar right was also checked , and there were bloody clashes on the opposite flank that scattered the Mahdist forces there .   Kitchener was anxious to occupy Omdurman before the remaining Mahdist forces could withdraw there . He advanced his army on the city , arranging them in separate columns for the attack . The British light cavalry regiment , the 21st Lancers , was sent ahead to clear the plain to Omdurman . They had a tough time of it . The 400-strong regiment attacked what they thought were only a few hundred dervishes , but in fact there were 2,500 infantry hidden behind them in a depression . After a fierce clash , the Lancers drove them back ( resulting in three Victoria Crosses being awarded to Lancers who helped rescue wounded comrades ) . One of the participants of this fight was Lieutenant Winston Churchill . On a larger scale , the British advance allowed the Khalifa to re-organize his forces . He still had over 30,000 men in the field and directed his main reserve to attack from the west while ordering the forces to the northwest to attack simultaneously over the Kerreri Hills .   Kitchener 's force wheeled left in echelon to advance up Surgham ridge and then southwards . To protect the rear , a brigade of 3,000 mainly Sudanese , commanded by Hector MacDonald , was reinforced with Maxims and artillery and followed the main force at around 1350 m. Curiously , the supplies and wounded around Egeiga"], [143, "This article is for the volcanic arc . For the namesake mountain range see Cascade Range .   The Cascade Volcanoes ( also known as the Cascade Volcanic Arc or the Cascade Arc ) are a number of volcanoes in a volcanic arc in western North America , extending from southwestern British Columbia through Washington and Oregon to Northern California , a distance of well over 700 mi . The arc has formed due to subduction along the Cascadia subduction zone . Although taking its name from the Cascade Range , this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one , and the Cascade Volcanoes extend north into the Coast Mountains , past the Fraser River which is the northward limit of the Cascade Range proper .   Some of the major cities along the length of the arc include Portland , Seattle , and Vancouver , and the population in the region exceeds 10,000,000 people . All could be potentially affected by volcanic activity and great subduction-zone earthquakes along the arc . Because the population of the Pacific Northwest is rapidly increasing , the Cascade volcanoes are some of the most dangerous , due to their eruptive history and potential for future eruptions , and because they are underlain by weak , hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks that are susceptible to failure . Consequently , Mount Rainier is one of the Decade Volcanoes identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth 's Interior ( IAVCEI ) as being worthy of particular study , due to the danger it poses to Seattle and Tacoma . Many large , long-runout landslides originating on Cascade volcanoes have inundated valleys tens of kilometers from their sources , and some of the inundated areas now support large populations .   The Cascade Volcanoes are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean . The Cascade Volcanoes have erupted several times in recorded history . Two most recent were Lassen Peak in 1914 to 1921 and a major eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 . It is also the site of Canada 's most recent major eruption about 2,350 years ago at the Mount Meager volcanic complex .   Geology   The Cascade Arc includes nearly 20 major volcanoes , among a total of over 4,000 separate volcanic vents including numerous stratovolcanoes , shield volcanoes , lava domes , and cinder cones , along with a few isolated examples of rarer volcanic forms such as tuyas . Volcanism in the arc began about 37 million years ago ; however , most of the present-day Cascade volcanoes are less than 2,000,000 years old , and the highest peaks are less than 100,000 years old . Twelve volcanoes in the arc are over 10000 ft in elevation , and the two highest , Mount Rainier and Mount Shasta , exceed 14000 ft. By volume , the two largest Cascade volcanoes are the broad shields of Medicine Lake Volcano and Newberry Volcano , which are about 145 cumi and 108 cumi respectively . Mount Garibaldi and Glacier Peak are the only two Cascade volcanoes that are made exclusively of dacite .   Over the last 37 million years , the Cascade Arc has been erupting a chain of volcanoes along the Pacific Northwest . Several of the volcanoes in the arc are frequently active . The volcanoes of the Cascade Arc share some general characteristics , but each has its own unique geological traits and history . Lassen Peak in California , which last erupted in 1917 , is the southernmost historically active volcano in the arc , while Mount Meager in British Columbia , which erupted about 2,350 years ago , is generally considered the northernmost member of the arc . A few isolated volcanic centers northwest of Mount Meager such as the Silverthrone Caldera , which is a circular 20 km wide , deeply dissected caldera complex , may also be the product of Cascadia subduction because the igneous rocks andesite , basaltic andesite , dacite and rhyolite can also be found at these volcanoes as they are elsewhere along the subduction zone . At issue are the current estimates of plate configuration and rate of subduction , but based on the chemistry of these volcanoes , they are also subduction related and therefore part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc . The Cascade Volcanic Arc appears to be segmented ; the central portion of the arc is the most active and the northern end least active .   Lavas representing the earliest stage in the development of the Cascade Volcanic Arc mostly crop out south of the North Cascades proper , where"], [144, "Hrunting was a sword given to Beowulf by Unferth in the ancient Old English epic poem Beowulf . Beowulf used it in battle against Grendel 's Mother .   Beowulf is described receiving the sword in lines 1455-1458 :   `` And another item lent by Unferth  at that moment of need was of no small importance :  the brehon handed him a hilted weapon ,  a rare and ancient sword named Hrunting .  The iron blade with its ill-boding patterns  had been tempered in blood . It had never failed  the hand of anyone who hefted it in battle ,  anyone who had fought and faced the worst  in the gap of danger . This was not the first time  it had been called to perform heroic feats .   However , although the sword possessed great power and was claimed to have never failed anyone who used it , when Beowulf descended to the bottom of the lake to fight Grendel 's mother , the sword proved ineffective . As the `` fabulous powers of that heirloom failed , '' Beowulf was forced to discard it .   Hrunting 's significance   Swords have great significance in the war-centred Anglo-Saxon culture from which Beowulf arises . Therefore , emphasis is strongly placed on the exchange of weapons of war . Weapons such as swords circulated through Anglo-Saxon society as inheritance through family , birthed through the monsters , found under magic rocks , and as rewards between lords and their subjects . Occasionally such exchange was also seen between warriors . One example of a weapon as a gift is seen in the exchange of Hrunting . As Unferth passes his sword to Beowulf , he admits the loss of his glory , and his submission to this greater warrior . However , when Hrunting fails Beowulf in his battle against Grendel 's mother , it possibly reflects its previous owner , Unferth , who failed to defeat the hated Grendel . In addition , Beowulf ’ s defeat of Grendel prompts the Danish king Hrothgar to bestow upon him many gifts consisting of weapons ; this further emphasizes the importance of weaponry to such a society . Beowulf then passes on his rewards to his king Hygelac , thereby establishing his obligation to his king . Hrunting ’ s various meanings demonstrate that weapons of war can carry not only positive , but also negative , significance .   Symbolism of Hrunting   Unferth ’ s very act of giving Hrunting to Beowulf and the sword ’ s unexpected failure in the battle against Grendel ’ s mother bear much symbolism in the poem . Given that Unferth shows his dislike for Beowulf early in the story , Unferth ’ s choice to award Beowulf with Hrunting , which means “ thrusting , ” can be interpreted as a sign of peace and acceptance . In this light , the giving of the sword seems to be an indication of Unferth ’ s recognition of Beowulf as a capable and powerful warrior . On the other hand , the poem portrays Unferth as a sly and treacherous man . Furthermore , scholars even propose that Hrunting is “ the very sword with which [ Unferth ] slew his own kin. ” Ettlinger , Ellen ( 1943 ) . Beowulf , Unferth and Hrunting : An Interpretation in Man , Vol . 43 , ( Jan. – Feb. , 1943 ) , pp.11-17 . Date Accessed : March 30 , 2009. p. 10 It is possible then that Unferth 's motive in giving away his sword upon being confronted with the problem of Grendel 's mother could very well be to avoid going into battle . The passing of Hrunting from Unferth 's hand to Beowulf is therefore a reflection of Unferth 's treachery as he abandons his role as a warrior of Heorot . At first glance , Unferth 's sudden act of generosity towards Beowulf appears to have been done for noble reasons . However , what is known about Unferth and the sword 's inefficacy in battle strongly suggest that Unferth 's intentions are cowardly rather than noble - something reinforced by the similarly equivocal role played by the sword 's `` hafted '' counterpart in Grettis Saga .   Hrunting 's failure   The reason behind Hrunting 's failing against Grendel 's Mother has been a point of much scholarly debate . J.L . Rosier , in A Design for Treachery : The Unferth Intrigue , puts forth the contention that Unferth deliberately gave Beowulf a sword that he knew would fail , possibly for the"], [145, "The neck , nicor , nixie or nokken ( ; , nekker ; ; ; ; ) are shapeshifting water spirits in Germanic mythology and folklore who usually appeared in forms of other creatures .   Under a variety of names , they were common to the stories of all Germanic peoples , although they are perhaps best known from Scandinavian folklore . The related English knucker was generally depicted as a wyrm or dragon , although more recent versions depict the spirits in other forms . Their sex , bynames , and various transformations vary geographically . The German Nix and his Scandinavian counterparts were males . The German Nixe was a female river mermaid .   Names and etymology   The names are held to derive from Common Germanic * nikwus or * nikwis ( i ) , derived from PIE * neigw ( `` to wash '' ) . They are related to Sanskrit nḗnēkti , Greek νίζω nízō and νίπτω níptō , and Irish nigh ( all meaning to wash or be washed ) . The form neck appears in English and Swedish ( näck or nek , meaning `` nude '' ) . The Swedish form is derived from Old Swedish neker , which corresponds to Old Icelandic nykr ( gen. nykrs ) , and nykk in Norwegian Nynorsk . In Finnish , the word is näkki . In Old Danish , the form was nikke and in modern Danish and Norwegian Bokmål it is nøkk . The Icelandic nykur is a horselike creature . In Middle Low German , it was called necker and in Middle Dutch nicker ( c.f . also Nickel or Nikkel plus Kobolt ) . The Old High German form nihhus also meant `` crocodile '' , while the Old English nicor could mean both a `` water monster '' like those encountered by Beowulf , and a `` hippopotamus '' . The Norwegian Fossegrim and Swedish Strömkarlen are related figures sometimes seen as by-names for the same creature . The Scandinavian version can transform himself into a horse-like kelpie , and is called a Bäckahästen ( the `` brook horse '' ) , whilst the Welsh version is called the Ceffyl Dŵr ( the `` water horse '' ) .   England   In the English county of Sussex , there are said to dwell `` water-wyrms '' called knuckers . The Word knucker is derived from the Old English nicor . English folklore contains many creatures with similarities to the Nix or Näck . These Necks include Jenny Greenteeth , the Shellycoat , Peg Powler , the Bäckahästen-like Brag , and the Grindylow .   Scandinavia   Näck , Nøkk   The Scandinavian näcken , näkki , nøkk were male water spirits who played enchanted songs on the violin , luring women and children to drown in lakes or streams . However , not all of these spirits were necessarily malevolent ; in fact , many stories exist that indicate at the very least that nøkker were entirely harmless to their audience and attracted not only women and children , but men as well with their sweet songs . Stories also exist where in the Fossegrim agreed to live with a human who had fallen in love with him , but many of these stories ended with the nøkk returning to his home , usually a nearby waterfall or brook . ( Compare the legend of Llyn y Fan Fach in Wales . ) Nøkker are said to grow despondent if they do not have free , regular contact with a water source .   The Norwegian Fossegrim or Grim , Swedish strömkarl , is a related figure who , if properly approached , will teach a musician to play so adeptly `` that the trees dance and waterfalls stop at his music . ''   It is difficult to describe the actual appearance of the nix , as one of his central attributes was thought to be shapeshifting . Perhaps he did not have any true shape . He could show himself as a man playing the violin in brooks and waterfalls ( though often imagined as fair and naked today , in actual folklore he was more frequently wearing more or less elegant clothing ) but also could appear to be treasure or various floating objects or as an animal—most commonly in the form of a `` brook horse '' ( see below ) . The modern Scandinavian names are derived from an Old Norse nykr , meaning `` river horse . '' Thus , likely the brook horse preceded the personification of the nix as the `` man in the rapids '' . Fossegrim and"], [146, "Australia ( , , ) , officially the Commonwealth of Australia , is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent , the island of Tasmania , and numerous smaller islands . It is the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . Neighbouring countries include Papua New Guinea , Indonesia and East Timor to the north ; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east ; and New Zealand to the south-east .   For about 50,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century , Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians ,  who spoke languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups . After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades ; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies were established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Since federation , Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories . The population of 24 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast .   Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world , with the world 's 12th-largest economy . In 2014 Australia had the world 's fifth-highest per capita income . Australia 's military expenditure is the world 's 13th-largest . With the second-highest human development index globally , Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance , such as quality of life , health , education , economic freedom , and the protection of civil liberties and political rights . Australia is a member of the United Nations , G20 , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , World Trade Organization , Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , and the Pacific Islands Forum .   Name   The name Australia ( pronounced in Australian English ) is derived from the Latin Terra Australis ( `` southern land '' ) a name used for putative lands in the southern hemisphere since ancient times . The earliest recorded use of the word Australia in English was in 1625 in `` A note of Australia del Espíritu Santo , written by Sir Richard Hakluyt '' , published by Samuel Purchas in Hakluytus Posthumus , a corruption of the original Spanish name `` Austrialia del Espíritu Santo '' ( Southern Land of the Holy Spirit ) for an island in Vanuatu . The Dutch adjectival form Australische was used in a Dutch book in Batavia ( Jakarta ) in 1638 , to refer to the newly discovered lands to the south .  The first time that the name Australia appears to have been officially used was in a despatch to Lord Bathurst of 4 April 1817 in which Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledges the receipt of Matthew Flinders ' charts of Australia . On 12 December 1817 , Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted . In 1824 , the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia .   History   Prehistory   Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago , possibly with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea-crossings from what is now Southeast Asia . These first inhabitants may have been ancestors of modern Indigenous Australians . At the time of European settlement in the late 18th century , most Indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers , with a complex oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime . The Torres Strait Islanders , ethnically Melanesian , were originally horticulturists and hunter-gatherers . The northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically by fishermen from Maritime Southeast Asia .   European arrival   The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland , and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent , are attributed to the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon . He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606 , and made landfall on 26 February at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York.Davison , Hirst and Macintyre , p. 233 . The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent `` New Holland '' during the 17th"], [147, "Finding Nemo is a 2003 American computer-animated comedy-drama adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures . Written and directed by Andrew Stanton with co-direction by Lee Unkrich , the film stars the voices of Albert Brooks , Ellen DeGeneres , Alexander Gould , and Willem Dafoe . It tells the story of the overprotective clownfish named Marlin who , along with a regal blue tang named Dory , searches for his abducted son Nemo all the way to Sydney Harbour . Along the way , Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself .   Finding Nemo was released on May 30 , 2003 , and has received universal critical acclaim . The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature , and was nominated in three more categories , including Best Original Screenplay . Finding Nemo became the highest-grossing animated film at the time and was the second highest-grossing film of 2003 , earning a total of $ 867 million worldwide by the end of its initial theatrical run .   The film is the best-selling DVD title of all time , with over 40 million copies sold , and was the highest-grossing G-rated film of all time before Pixar 's own Toy Story 3 overtook it . The film was re-released in 3D in 2012 . In 2008 , the American Film Institute named it the 10th greatest animated film ever made as part of their 10 Top 10 lists . A sequel , Finding Dory , was released on June 17 , 2016 .   Plot   Two ocellaris clownfish , Marlin and his wife Coral , admire their new home in the Great Barrier Reef and their clutch of eggs when a barracuda attacks , knocking Marlin unconscious . He wakes up to find out that Coral and all but one of the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda . Marlin names this last egg Nemo , a name that Coral liked .   Nemo develops a smaller right fin as a result of damage to his egg during the attack , which limits his swimming ability . Worried about Nemo 's safety , Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip . Nemo sneaks away from the reef and is captured by scuba divers . As the boat departs , a diver accidentally knocks his diving mask overboard . While attempting to save Nemo , Marlin meets Dory , a good-hearted and optimistic regal blue tang with short-term memory loss . Marlin and Dory meet three sharks – Bruce , Anchor and Chum – who claim to be vegetarians . Marlin discovers the diver 's mask and notices an address written on it . When he argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed , the blood scent causes Bruce to enter an uncontrollable feeding frenzy . The pair escape from Bruce but the mask falls into a trench in the deep sea .   During a hazardous struggle with an anglerfish in the trench , Dory sees the diving mask and reads the address located at 42 Wallaby Way , Sydney , NSW . The pair swims on , receiving directions to Sydney from a school of moonfish . Marlin and Dory encounter a bloom of jellyfish that nearly kills them . Marlin loses consciousness and wakes up on a sea turtle named Crush , who takes Marlin and Dory on the East Australian Current . Marlin tells the details of his long journey with a group of sea turtles , and his story is spread across the ocean . He also sees how Crush gets along well with his son Squirt .   Meanwhile , Nemo is placed in a fish tank in the office of a naive dentist named Phillip Sherman in Sydney Harbour . He meets aquarium fish called the Tank Gang , led by a moorish idol named Gill , who has a broken fin . The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to Sherman 's niece , Darla , who has killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag . Gill then reveals his plan to escape , jamming the tank 's filter , forcing the dentist to remove the fish to clean it . The fish would be placed in plastic bags , and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor . After an attempt at the escape goes wrong , a australian pelican , Nigel , brings news of Marlin 's adventure . Inspired by his father 's determination , Nemo successfully jams the filter , but the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape"], [148, "Waterford ( ; ) Discover Waterford , by Eamon McEneaney ( 2001 ) . ( ISBN 0-86278-656-8 ) is a city in Ireland . It is in the South-East of Ireland and is part of the province of Munster . The city is situated at the head of Waterford Harbour . It is the oldest i 23 July 2013. and the fifth most populous city within the Republic of Ireland . It is the eighth most populous city on the island of Ireland . Waterford City and County Council is the local government authority for the city . Waterford is known for Waterford Crystal , a legacy of the city 's former glass making industry .   According to the 2011 Irish Census , there are 65,928 in the Waterford Metropolitan District , however it does not include its suburbs in County Kilkenny and County Wexford . There are over 80,000 within a 15 km radius of the city centre .   Geography and local government   With a population of 46,732 , Waterford is the fifth most populous city in the State and the 32nd most populous area of local government .   Following the Local Government Reform Act 2014 , Waterford City and County Council is the local government authority for the city . The authority came into operation on 1 June 2014 . Prior to this the city had its own local council , Waterford City Council . The new Council is the result of a merger of Waterford City Council and Waterford County Council . The Council has 32 representatives ( councillors ) who are elected from five electoral areas . The city itself forms three of the electoral areas – which when combined form the Metropolitan District of Waterford – and returns a total of 18 councillors to Waterford City and County Council . Residents in these areas are restricted to voting for candidates located in their ward for local elections . The office of the Mayor of Waterford was established in 1377 . A mayor is then elected by the councillors from the two electoral areas of the Metropolitan District of Waterford every year , and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual may serve . Mary O'Halloran who was mayor during 2007–2008 was the first woman to hold the post . The current mayor is John Cummins .   For the purposes of elections to Dáil Éireann , the city is part of the Waterford constituency , which includes the county of Waterford except for those parts of the county near Clonmel that lie in Tipperary South . The constituency elects four deputies to Dáil Éireann . There are no such ward restrictions for these elections and voters are entitled to vote for any candidate throughout the city and county .   History   Viking raiders first established a settlement near Waterford in 853 . It and all the other longphorts were vacated in 902 , the Vikings having been driven out by the native Irish . The Vikings re-established themselves in Ireland at Waterford in 914 , led at first by Ottir Iarla ( Jarl Ottar ) until 917 , and after that by Ragnall ua Ímair and the Uí Ímair dynasty , and built what would be Ireland 's first city . Among the most prominent rulers of Waterford was Ivar of Waterford .   In 1167 , Diarmait Mac Murchada , the deposed King of Leinster , failed in an attempt to take Waterford . He returned in 1170 with Cambro-Norman mercenaries under Richard de Clare , 2nd Earl of Pembroke ( known as Strongbow ) ; together they besieged and took the city after a desperate defence . In furtherance of the Norman invasion of Ireland , King Henry II of England landed at Waterford in 1171 . Waterford and then Dublin were declared royal cities , with Dublin also declared capital of Ireland .

It is a tribute to Leander Starr Jameson . The poem is written in the form of paternal advice to the poet 's son , John . As poetry , `` If— '' is a literary example of Victorian-era stoicism .   Publication   The initial publication of the poem `` If— '' was in the `` Brother Square Toes '' chapter of the book Rewards and Fairies ( 1910 ) , a collection of Kipling 's poetry and short-story fiction . In the posthumously published autobiography Something of Myself ( 1937 ) , Kipling said that his poetic inspiration for the poem was the military actions of Leander Starr Jameson , leader of the failed Jameson Raid ( December 1895 – January 1896 ) against the Transvaal Republic to overthrow the Boer Government of Paul Kruger some 15 years prior to its publication . The failure of that mercenary coup d ’ état aggravated the political tensions between Great Britain and the Boers , which led to the Second Boer War ( 1899–1902 ) .   Text   If   If you can keep your head when all about you  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you ,  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you ,  But make allowance for their doubting too ;  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting ,  Or being lied about , don ’ t deal in lies ,  Or being hated , don ’ t give way to hating ,  And yet don ’ t look too good , nor talk too wise :   If you can dream—and not make dreams your master ;  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim ;  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  And treat those two impostors just the same ;  If you can bear to hear the truth you 've spoken  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools ,  Or watch the things you gave your life to , broken ,  And stoop and build ’ em up with worn-out tools :   If you can make one heap of all your winnings  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss ,  And lose , and start again at your beginnings  And never breathe a word about your loss ;  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  To serve your turn long after they are gone ,  And so hold on when there is nothing in you  Except the Will which says to them : “ Hold on ! ”   If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue ,  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch ,  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you ,  If all men count with you , but none too much ;  If you can fill the unforgiving minute  With sixty seconds ’ worth of distance run ,  Yours is the Earth and everything that ’ s in it ,  And—which is more—you ’ ll be a Man , my son .   Reception   As an evocation of Victorian-era stoicism—the “ stiff upper lip ” self-discipline , which popular culture rendered into a British national virtue and character trait , `` If— '' remains a cultural touchstone . The British cultural-artefact status of the poem is evidenced by the parodies of the poem , and by its popularity among Britons .   In India , a framed copy of the poem was affixed to the wall before the study desk in the cabins of the officer cadets at the National Defence Academy , at Pune and Indian Naval Academy , at Ezhimala . In Britain , the third and fourth lines of the second stanza of the poem : “ If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster / and treat those two impostors just the same ” are written on the wall of the players ’ entrance to the Centre Court at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club , where the Wimbledon Championships are held .

He made his film debut with a leading role in the 1985 film The Legend of Billie Jean . He played a monk 's apprentice alongside Sean Connery in The Name of the Rose before gaining wider recognition for his breakthrough role in the cult film Heathers .   In the 1990s , Slater starred in many big budget films , including Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves , Interview with the Vampire : The Vampire Chronicles , FernGully : The Last Rainforest , Broken Arrow , and Hard Rain . He was also featured in the cult film True Romance . Since 2000 , Slater has combined work in the film business with television , including appearances in The West Wing and Alias and starring in Breaking In and Mind Games . He currently stars as the title character on the USA Network series Mr . Robot , for which he won his first Golden Globe at the 73rd Golden Globe Awards .   Slater was married to Ryan Haddon between 2000 and 2005 , and they had two children together . Slater has had widely publicized brushes with the law , including being sentenced to three months in jail for assault in 1997 .   Early life   Slater was born in New York City , to Michael Hawkins ( né Thomas Knight Slater ) , an actor who is also known as Michael Gainsborough , and Mary Jo Slater ( née Lawton ) , an acting agent turned casting executive and producer . Slater has a maternal half-brother , Ryan Slater , who is also an actor . His great-uncle was radio personality Bill Slater . Though he played her character 's younger brother in the movie The Legend of Billie Jean , he is not related to Helen Slater . He attended the Dalton School , the Professional Children 's School and the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts .   Career   Early career   Slater 's first television role was on the ABC soap opera One Life to Live when he was 8 years old . Following a run on Ryan 's Hope , he made his Broadway debut as the lisping Winthrop Paroo opposite Dick Van Dyke in the 1980 revival of The Music Man . Additional Broadway credits include Copperfield , Merlin , Macbeth , Side Man , and The Glass Menagerie . In addition he has performed in London 's West End in One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest and Swimming With Sharks .   Slater made his big screen debut in 1985 's The Legend of Billie Jean playing Billie Jean ’ s brother Binx . Though expected to be a big hit , the film fell short at the box office , despite gaining a cult following . His career improved with his role in The Name of the Rose ( 1986 ) alongside Sean Connery . Slater played Connery 's apprentice monk while they investigated a series of murders at a Benedictine abbey . Slater followed this by playing Junior Tucker in Francis Ford Coppola 's Tucker : The Man and His Dream ( 1988 ) , Gleaming the Cube ( 1989 ) and Beyond the Stars ( 1989 ) .   Slater 's career rose to new heights when he played the dark character J.D . in the 1989 film Heathers alongside Winona Ryder . Heathers was billed as the teen film of the late 1980s . Slater beat out many other actors such as Brad Pitt for the part and his performance drew comparison with a young Jack Nicholson . After Heathers and a small role in Stanley Kubrick 's Full Metal Jacket ( 1987 ) , Slater had offers to play more troubled youths , including as a rebellious teen in Pump Up the Volume ( 1990 ) and a wild gunman in Young Guns II ( 1990 ) , in which Slater acted alongside Emilio Estevez and Kiefer Sutherland .   Box office success   In 1991 , Slater was cast as Will Scarlett in the Hollywood big budget production of Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves alongside Kevin Costner , Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman . The film was a commercial success , taking US $ 390 million worldwide , and Slater became one of the major A-list stars of the 1990s . With Slater being a big Star Trek fan , he accepted a minor role in Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country , shortly after playing Charlie Luciano in the crime drama Mobsters .

It is used for Test cricket , One Day International cricket , Twenty20 cricket and Australian rules football , as well as some rugby league football and rugby union matches . It is the home ground for the New South Wales Blues cricket team , the Sydney Sixers of the Big Bash League and the Sydney Swans Australian Football League club . It is owned and operated by the SCG Trust that also manages the Sydney Football Stadium located next door . Until the 44,000 seat Football Stadium was opened in 1988 , the Sydney Cricket Ground was the major rugby league venue in Sydney .   History   In 1811 , the Governor of New South Wales , Lachlan Macquarie , established the second Sydney Common , about one-and-a-half miles wide and extending south from South Head Rd ( now Oxford St ) to where Randwick Racecourse is today . Part sandhills , part swamp and situated on the south-eastern fringe of the city , it was used as a rubbish dump in the 1850s and not regarded as an ideal place for sport . In 1851 , part of the Sydney Common south of Victoria Barracks was granted to the British Army for use as a garden and cricket ground for the soldiers . Its first user was the 11th North Devonshire Regiment which flattened and graded the southern part of the rifle range adjacent to the Barracks .   In the next couple of years , the teams from Victoria Barracks combined themselves into a more permanent organisation and called themselves the Garrison Club . The ground therefore became known as the Garrison Ground when it was first opened in February 1854 .   Up until that time Hyde Park had been the main sporting and racing ground in the colony but when it was dedicated as public gardens in 1856 city cricketers and footballers had to find somewhere else to play .   In the late 1860s another part of the Sydney Common , the area west of the Garrison Ground to the then Dowling Street , was opened for public recreation . It was named Moore Park after the Mayor of Sydney , Charles Moore , who planted a number of Moreton Bay Fig trees which exist to this day . As well as the location of Sydney 's first zoo , Moore Park was a regular venue for games between Sydney rugby clubs Sydney University and the Wallaroos . Sydney at the time was a small , dense city and best navigated on foot and Moore Park was on the outskirts . It was not liked so much by cricketers because it was too far from the city .   When the commander of the Sydney garrison , Lieutenant-Colonel John Richardson , aligned his soldiers to the East Sydney Cricket Club , the Garrison Ground became known as the Civil and Military Ground . In 1870 British troops left Victoria barracks and the future of the Civil and Military Ground became uncertain . However , with the closure of the Albert Ground in the 1870s , the NSW Cricket Association ( NSWCA ) began regular use of the Civil and Military Ground .   In 1875 the NSW Government began to upgrade the ground . Despite efforts by Victoria Barracks and then the Carlingford , Redfern , Fitzroy and Albert cricket clubs to take control , the then president of the NSWCA , Richard Driver ( after whom Driver Avenue outside the ground is named ) , persuaded the government to let the NSWCA look after the ground 's administration . In 1876 , the ground was dedicated by Governor Sir Hercules Robinson .   The NSWCA had influential supporters . Driver himself was a prominent MP and solicitor for the City of Sydney Council . The Minister for Lands , Thomas Garrett , was also supportive ; his son was about to break into the colonial side . It is hardly surprising therefore that within a couple of years of the NSWCA taking control of the ground , the governor , Sir Hercules Robinson , appointed Driver himself , William W. Stephen and Phillip Sheridan ( after whom a grandstand was named ) , the first trustees . Two trustees were appointed by the government and one by the NSWCA . The close relationship between the Trust and the NSWCA is evidenced by the fact that they pooled funds for the next six years . The military 's link with the ground was finally severed when John Richardson and the Sydney garrison went to fight in the Sudan ."], [152, "Croquet is a sport that involves hitting plastic or wooden balls with a mallet through hoops ( often called `` wickets '' in the United States ) embedded in a grass playing court .   History   The oldest document to bear the word croquet with a description of the modern game is the set of rules registered by Isaac Spratt in November 1856 with the Stationers ' Company in London . This record is now in the Public Record Office . In 1868 , the first croquet all-comers ' meet was held at Moreton-in-Marsh , Gloucestershire and in the same year the All England Croquet Club was formed at Wimbledon , London .   Regardless when and by what route it reached England and the British colonies in its recognizable form , croquet is , like golf , pall-mall , trucco , and kolven , among the later forms of ground billiards , which as a class have been popular in Western Europe back to at least the Late Middle Ages , with roots in classical antiquity , including sometimes the use of arches and pegs along with and balls and mallets or other striking sticks ( some more akin to modern field hockey sticks ) . By the 12th century , a team ball game called ' or ' , akin to a chaotic version of hockey or football ( depending on whether sticks were used ) , was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes ; it was attested in Cornwall as early as 1283 .   In the book Queen of Games : The History of Croquet , Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet , which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas .   The first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to Britain from France during the 1630–1685 reign of Charles II of England , and was played under the name of ' ( among other spellings , today usually pall-mall ) , derived ultimately from Latin words for ' '' ball and mallet ' ( the latter also found in the name of the earlier French game , ' ) . This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica , dated 1877 . In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England , Joseph Strutt , in 1611 , described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time : `` Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box [ wood ] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron , which he that can do at the fewest blows , or at the number agreed upon , wins . It is to be observed , that there are two of these arches , that is one at either end of the alley . The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second , and the walk in Saint James 's Park , now called the Mall , received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall , where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime . ''   While the name pall-mall and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere ( France and Italy ) , the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century . Some other early modern sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance ( as in golf ) , however an image in Strutt 's 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game ( balls on ground , hoop , bats and peg ) being played over a , garden-sized distance . The image 's caption describes the game as `` a curious ancient pastime '' , confirming that croquet games were not new in early nineteenth century England .   In Samuel Johnson 's 1755 dictionary , his definition of `` pall-mall '' clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet : `` A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring '' . However , there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game .   The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from Ireland during the 1850s , perhaps after being brought there from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches . Regular contact between Ireland and France had continued since the Norman invasion of Ireland in"], [153, "Salem is the capital of the U.S. state of Oregon , and the county seat of Marion County . It is located in the center of the Willamette Valley alongside the Willamette River , which runs north through the city . The river forms the boundary between Marion and Polk counties , and the city neighborhood of West Salem is in Polk County . Salem was founded in 1842 , became the capital of the Oregon Territory in 1851 , and was incorporated in 1857 .   Salem had a population of 154,637 at the 2010 census , making it the third largest city in the state after Portland and Eugene . Salem is less than an hour driving distance away from Portland . Salem is the principal city of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area , a metropolitan area that covers Marion and Polk counties and had a combined population of 390,738 at the 2010 census . A 2013 estimate placed the metropolitan population at 400,408 , the state 's second largest .   The city is home to Willamette University , Corban University , and Chemeketa Community College . The State of Oregon is the largest public employer in the city , and Salem Health is the largest private employer . Transportation includes public transit from Salem-Keizer Transit , Amtrak service , and non-commercial air travel at McNary Field . Major roads include Interstate 5 , Oregon Route 99E , and Oregon Route 22 , which connects West Salem across the Willamette River via the Marion Street and Center Street bridges .   History   Origin of name   The Native Americans who inhabited the central Willamette Valley at first European contact , the Kalapuya , called the area Chim-i-ki-ti , which means `` meeting or resting place '' in the Central Kalapuya language ( Santiam ) . When the Methodist Mission moved to the area , they called the new establishment Chemeketa ; although it was more widely known as the Mill , because of its situation on Mill Creek . When the Oregon Institute was established , the community became known as the Institute .   When the Institute was dissolved , the trustees decided to lay out a townsite on the Institute lands . Some possible sources for the name `` Salem '' include William H. Willson , who in 1850 and 1851 filed the plats for the main part of the city , and suggested adopting an Anglicized version of the Biblical word `` Shalom '' , meaning peace . The Reverend David Leslie , President of the town 's Trustees , also wanted a Biblical name , and suggested using the last five letters of `` Jerusalem '' . Or , the town may be named after Salem , Massachusetts , where Leslie was educated . There were many names suggested , and even after the change to Salem , some people , such as Asahel Bush ( editor of the Oregon Statesman ) , believed the name should be changed back to Chemeketa .

Native Americans   It is estimated that the Willamette Valley area has been inhabited for over 10,000 years . The Kalapuya peoples would gather on the plateau east and south of the current downtown area in the winter and establish camps . They fished and harvested in the streams and fields of the area . One staple of life was the camas root , and periodically the Kalapuya would set fires that would clear and fertilize the meadows where it grew . In the early 1850s , the Kalapuya , along with the other native peoples west of the Cascade Mountains , were removed by the U.S. government through a combination of treaties and force . Most Kalapuya people were moved to the Grande Ronde Reservation somewhat to the west of Salem , with smaller numbers ending up at Siletz Reservation and other Oregon and Washington reservations .   Europeans   The first people of European descent arrived in the area as early as 1812 ; they were animal trappers and food gatherers for the fur trading companies in Astoria , Oregon .   The first permanent American settlement in the area was the Jason Lee Methodist mission ( 1840 ) located in the area north of Salem known as Wheatland .

Clocks , watches , clockwork , sundials , hourglasses , clepsydras , timers , time recorders , marine chronometers and atomic clocks are all examples of instruments used to measure time . In current usage , horology refers mainly to the study of mechanical time-keeping devices , while chronometry more broadly includes electronic devices that have largely supplanted mechanical clocks for the best accuracy and precision in time-keeping .   People interested in horology are called horologists . That term is used both by people who deal professionally with timekeeping apparatus ( watchmakers , clockmakers ) , as well as aficionados and scholars of horology . Horology and horologists have numerous organizations , both professional associations and more scholarly societies .   Museums and libraries   There are many horology museums and several specialized libraries devoted to the subject . One example is the Royal Greenwich Observatory , which is also the source of the Prime Meridian ( longitude 0° 0 ' 0 '' ) , and the home of the first marine timekeepers accurate enough to determine longitude ( made by John Harrison ) . Other horological museums in the London area include the Clockmakers ' Museum , which re-opened at the Science Museum in October 2015 , and the horological collections at the British Museum , the Science Museum ( London ) and at the Wallace Collection .   One of the more comprehensive museums dedicated to horology is the Musée international d'horlogerie in La Chaux-de-Fonds ( Switzerland ) . The Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle is smaller but located nearby . One of the better horological museums in Germany is the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum in Furtwangen im Schwarzwald , in the Black Forest .

Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ( APL ) and the Southwest Research Institute ( SwRI ) , with a team led by S. Alan Stern , the spacecraft was launched with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system , and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects ( KBOs ) .   On January 19 , 2006 , New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about . After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL , New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter , making its closest approach on February 28 , 2007 , at a distance of . The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons speed ; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons scientific capabilities , returning data about the planet 's atmosphere , moons , and magnetosphere .   Most of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve on-board systems , except for brief annual checkouts . On December 6 , 2014 , New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter , and instrument check-out began . On January 15 , 2015 , the New Horizons spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto .   On July 14 , 2015 , at 11:49 UTC , it flew 12500 km above the surface of Pluto , making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet . Having completed its flyby of Pluto , New Horizons has maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object , expected to take place on January 1 , 2019 , when it is 43.4 AU from the Sun .   History   Stamatios `` Tom '' Krimigis , head of the Applied Physics Laboratory 's space division , one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition , formed the New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000 . Appointed as the project 's principal investigator , Stern was described by Krimigis as `` the personification of the Pluto mission '' . New Horizons was based largely on Stern 's work since Pluto 350 and involved most of the team from Pluto Kuiper Express . The New Horizons proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA . It was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study , in June 2001 . The other finalist , POSSE ( Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer ) , was a separate , but similar Pluto mission concept by the University of Colorado Boulder , led by principal investigator Larry W. Esposito , and supported by the JPL , Lockheed Martin and the University of California . However , the APL , in addition to being supported by Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University , were at an advantage ; they had recently developed NEAR Shoemaker for NASA , which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier in the year , and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare .   In November 2001 , New Horizons was officially selected for funding as part of the New Frontiers program . However , the new NASA Administrator appointed by the Bush Administration , Sean O'Keefe , was not supportive of New Horizons , and effectively cancelled it by not including it in NASA 's budget for 2003 . NASA 's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate Ed Weiler prompted Stern to lobby for the funding of New Horizons in hopes of the mission appearing in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey ; a prioritized `` wish list '' , compiled by the United States National Research Council , that reflects the opinions of the scientific community . After an intense campaign to gain support for New Horizons , the Planetary Science Decadal Survey of 2003-2013 was published in the summer of 2002 . New Horizons topped the list of projects considered the highest priority among the scientific community in the medium-size category ; ahead of missions to the Moon , and even Jupiter . Weiler stated that it was a result that `` [ his ] administration was not going to fight '' . Funding for the mission was finally secured following the publication of the report , and Stern 's team were finally able to start building the spacecraft and its instruments , with a planned launch in January 2006 and arrival at Pluto in"], [156, "Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death . It typically causes more than one of the following : an itchy rash , throat or tongue swelling , shortness of breath , vomiting , lightheadedness , and low blood pressure . These symptoms typically come on over minutes to hours .   Common causes include insect bites and stings , foods , and medications . Other causes include latex exposure and exercise . Additionally cases may occur without an obvious reason . The mechanism involves the release of mediators from certain types of white blood cells triggered by either immunologic or non-immunologic mechanisms . Diagnosis is based on the presenting symptoms and signs after exposure to a potential allergen .   The primary treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine injection into a muscle , intravenous fluids , and positioning the person flat . Additional doses of epinephrine may be required . Other measures , such as antihistamines and steroids , are complementary . Carrying an epinephrine autoinjector and identification regarding the condition is recommended in people with a history of anaphylaxis .   Worldwide , 0.05–2 % of the population is estimated to experience anaphylaxis at some point in life . Rates appear to be increasing . It occurs most often in young people and females . Of people who go to a hospital with anaphylaxis in the United States about 0.3 % die . The term comes from the , and the .   Signs and symptoms   Anaphylaxis typically presents many different symptoms over minutes or hours with an average onset of 5 to 30 minutes if exposure is intravenous and 2 hours if from eating food . The most common areas affected include : skin ( 80–90 % ) , respiratory ( 70 % ) , gastrointestinal ( 30–45 % ) , heart and vasculature ( 10–45 % ) , and central nervous system ( 10–15 % ) with usually two or more being involved .   Skin   Symptoms typically include generalized hives , itchiness , flushing , or swelling ( angioedema ) of the afflicted tissues . Those with angioedema may describe a burning sensation of the skin rather than itchiness . Swelling of the tongue or throat occurs in up to about 20 % of cases . Other features may include a runny nose and swelling of the conjunctiva . The skin may also be blue tinged because of lack of oxygen .   Respiratory   Respiratory symptoms and signs that may be present include shortness of breath , wheezes , or stridor . The wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the bronchial muscles while stridor is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling . Hoarseness , pain with swallowing , or a cough may also occur .   Cardiovascular   Coronary artery spasm may occur with subsequent myocardial infarction , dysrhythmia , or cardiac arrest . Those with underlying coronary disease are at greater risk of cardiac effects from anaphylaxis . The coronary spasm is related to the presence of histamine-releasing cells in the heart . While a fast heart rate caused by low blood pressure is more common , a Bezold–Jarisch reflex has been described in 10 % of cases where a slow heart rate is associated with low blood pressure . A drop in blood pressure or shock ( either distributive or cardiogenic ) may cause the feeling of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness . Rarely very low blood pressure may be the only sign of anaphylaxis .   Other   Gastrointestinal symptoms may include crampy abdominal pain , diarrhea , and vomiting . There may be confusion , a loss of bladder control or pelvic pain similar to that of uterine cramps . Dilation of blood vessels around the brain may cause headaches . A feeling of anxiety or of `` impending doom '' has also been described .   Causes   Anaphylaxis can occur in response to almost any foreign substance . Common triggers include venom from insect bites or stings , foods , and medication . Foods are the most common trigger in children and young adults while medications and insect bites and stings are more common in older adults .

Sculpted by Danish-American Gutzon Borglum and his son , Lincoln Borglum , Mount Rushmore features 60 ft sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents : George Washington ( 1732–1799 ) , Thomas Jefferson ( 1743–1826 ) , Theodore Roosevelt ( 1858–1919 ) , and Abraham Lincoln ( 1809–1865 ) .

Retrieved March 13 , 2006 .   South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region . Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles site because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups . They settled on the Mount Rushmore location , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure . Robinson wanted it to feature western heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud , and Buffalo Bill Cody , but Borglum decided the sculpture should have a more national focus and chose the four presidents whose likenesses would be carved into the mountain . After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of `` Mount Rushmore 's great political patron '' , U.S . Senator Peter Norbeck , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 . Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over construction . Although the initial concept called for each president to be depicted from head to waist , lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 .   Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States , and has appeared in works of fiction , and has been discussed or depicted in other popular works . It attracts over two million people annually .   History   Originally known to the Lakota Sioux as `` The Six Grandfathers '' , the mountain was renamed after Charles E. Rushmore , a prominent New York lawyer , during an expedition in 1885 . At first , the project of carving Rushmore was undertaken to increase tourism in the Black Hills region of South Dakota . After long negotiations involving a Congressional delegation and President Calvin Coolidge , the project received Congressional approval . The carving started in 1927 , and ended in 1941 with no fatalities .   As Six Grandfathers , the mountain was part of the route that Lakota leader Black Elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at Harney Peak . Following a series of military campaigns from 1876 to 1878 , the United States asserted control over the area , a claim that is still disputed on the basis of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie ( see section `` Controversy '' below ) . Among American settlers , the peak was known variously as Cougar Mountain , Sugarloaf Mountain , Slaughterhouse Mountain , and Keystone Cliffs . It was named Mount Rushmore during a prospecting expedition by Charles Rushmore , David Swanzey ( husband of Carrie Ingalls ) , and Bill Challis.Keystone Area Historical Society [ http : //www.keystonechamber.com/kahs/characters.html Keystone Characters ] . Retrieved October 3 , 2006 .   Historian Doane Robinson conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote tourism in South Dakota . In 1924 , Robinson persuaded sculptor Gutzon Borglum to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure the carving could be accomplished . Borglum had been involved in sculpting the Confederate Memorial Carving , a massive bas-relief memorial to Confederate leaders on Stone Mountain in Georgia , but was in disagreement with the officials there .   The original plan was to perform the carvings in granite pillars known as the Needles . However , Borglum realized that the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting . He chose Mount Rushmore , a grander location , partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun . Borglum said upon seeing Mount Rushmore , `` America will march along that skyline . '' Congress authorized the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission on March 3 , 1925 .

Originally established in 1945 as a cell within the Muslim Brotherhood under Abdel Moneim Abdel Raouf , which included Gamal Abdel Nasser , Hussein Hamouda , Khaled Mohieddin , Kamal el-Din Hussein , Salah Naṣr , Abdel Hakim Amer , and Sa ’ ad Tawfiq , it operated as a clandestine movement of junior officers during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War . Muhammad Naguib joined the Free Officers in 1949 , after the war , and became their official leader during the turmoil leading up the revolution because of the hero status he had earned during the war , and his influence in the army .   Background   Economic challenges that emerged following the First World War , namely the Great Depression , affected national economies around the globe , including those of Egypt and Sudan . During this time , the Great Powers in the Arab World and Middle East began removing institutions for economic development after some positive advancement became evident . This encouraged many political groups to organize against the politicians who dominated the parliamentary politics of the time . Workers had become accustomed to development efforts which were meant to stabilize the economies of the region . These state-led initiatives set the standard for what the people expected of their government , including the regulation of imports , industrial investment , commodity distribution , production supervision .   Formation   Politicians and government bodies were forced to respond to the demands of groups who were directly affected by the initiative changes and withdrawals . Some of these groups included military officers . While the first military coups began in Syria in the late 1940s , it was the Free Officers coup in Egypt and the revolution of 1952 that would have the greatest impact , and encourage later movements . The members were not of the wealthy elite , but rather the middle class , young workers , government officials and junior officers . The movement , which began and spread throughout the 1940s , came to fruition with the leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser . Nasser , who commanded the loyalty and respect of the other members , formed a coordinating committee ( 1949 ) , of which he was acclaimed head ( 1950 ) . Coming from a modest background , he signified the group 's majority : the hard working middle class . The Free Officers consisted of urban dwellers and educated militants with a lower middle class upbringing . Nasser was a war hero who rose quickly in military rank to colonel . He , like many others , dedicated his time and energy to reverse the corruption seen on the part of the government throughout the 1948 Palestine war by restoring a democracy . He saw the problem of domestic passive reaction to imperialism as much a problem as imperialism itself . They strengthened a `` new '' middle class . Due to this dedication toward change , the Free Officers referred to their group and its entirety as simply a `` movement . '' Later however , it would become a revolution .   The Free Officers Committee enlisted General Muhammad Naguib as a public figurehead in preparation for the successful coup of 23 July 1952 . The men who had constituted themselves as the Committee of the Free Officers Movement and led the 1952 Revolution were Lieutenant Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser ( 1917–70 ) , Major Abdel Hakim Amer ( 1919–67 ) , Lieutenant Colonel Anwar El-Sadat ( 1918–81 ) , Major Salah Salem ( 1920–62 ) , Major Kamal el-Din Hussein ( 1921–99 ) , Wing Commander Gamal Salem ( 1918–2001 ) , Squadron Leader Hassan Ibrahim ( 1917–90 ) , Major Khalid Mohieddin ( 1922– ) , and Wing Commander Abdel Latif Boghdadi ( 1917–99 ) ; Major Hussein el-Shafei ( 1918–2005 ) and Lieutenant Colonel Zakaria Mohieddin ( 1918–2012 ) joined the committee later .   The continued agitation within Egypt as a result of British control led to a series of revolts where British military outposts were attacked . From 1950–52 , workers in the Suez Canal Zone went on strike but were blockaded by British tanks . The government in Cairo warned nationalists not to interfere in public spaces that are associated with imperialism . Contrarily , attacks were made against the British and the Egyptian elites who worked with them . At this point , Egyptian nationalist groups were divided and unorganised . The military was the only area that still held some sort of organised mission , which"], [159, "Capital : Critique of Political Economy ( , ; 1867–1883 ) by Karl Marx is a foundational theoretical text in communist philosophy , economics and politics . Marx aimed to reveal the economic patterns underpinning the capitalist mode of production , in contrast to classical political economists such as Adam Smith , David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill .   Themes   In Capital : Critique of Political Economy ( 1867 ) , Karl Marx proposes that the motivating force of capitalism is in the exploitation of labour , whose unpaid work is the ultimate source of surplus value and then profit both of which concepts have a specific meaning for Marx . The employer is able to claim the right to profits because he or she owns the productive capital assets ( means of production ) , which are legally protected by the capitalist state through property rights ( the historical section shows how this right was acquired in the first place chiefly through plunder and conquest and the activity of the merchant and 'middle-man ' ) . In producing capital ( money ) as well as commodities ( goods and services ) , the workers continually reproduce the economic conditions by which they labour . Capital proposes an explanation of the `` laws of motion '' of the capitalist economic system , from its origins throughout its future , by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital , the growth of wage labour , the transformation of the workplace , the concentration of capital , commercial competition , the banking system , the decline of the profit rate , land-rents , et cetera .   The critique of the political economy of capitalism proposes that :  * The commodity is the basic `` cell-form '' ( trade unit ) of a capitalist society , but capitalism is distinguished from other forms of production based on commodities in that here labour power becomes a commodity like any other . Moreover , because commerce , as a human activity , implied no morality beyond that required to buy and sell goods and services , the growth of the market system made discrete entities of the economic , the moral , and the legal spheres of human activity in society ; hence , subjective moral value is separate from objective economic value . Subsequently , political economy — the just distribution of wealth and `` political arithmetick '' about taxes — became three discrete fields of human activity : Economics , Law , and Ethics , politics and economics divorced .  * `` The economic formation of society [ is ] a process of natural history '' , thus it is possible for a political economist to objectively study the scientific laws of capitalism , given that its expansion of the market system of commerce had objectified human economic relations ; the use of money ( cash nexus ) voided religious and political illusions about its economic value , and replaced them with commodity fetishism , the belief that an object ( commodity ) has inherent economic value . Because societal economic formation is a historical process , no one person could control or direct it , thereby creating a global complex of social connections among capitalists ; thus , the economic formation ( individual commerce ) of a society precedes the human administration of an economy ( organised commerce ) .  * The structural contradictions of a capitalist economy , the gegensätzliche Bewegung , describe the contradictory movement originating from the two-fold character of labour , and so the class struggle between labour and capital , the wage labourer and the owner of the means of production . These capitalist economic contradictions operate `` behind the backs '' of the capitalists and the workers , as a result of their activities , and yet remain beyond their immediate perceptions as men and women and as social classes .  * The economic crises ( recession , depression , etc . ) that are rooted in the contradictory character of the economic value of the commodity ( cell-unit ) of a capitalist society , are the conditions that propitiate proletarian revolution ; which the Communist Manifesto ( 1848 ) collectively identified as a weapon , forged by the capitalists , which the working class `` turned against the bourgeoisie , itself '' .  * In a capitalist economy , technological improvement and its consequent increased production augment the amount of material wealth ( use value ) in society , whilst simultaneously diminishing the economic value of the same wealth , thereby diminishing the rate of profit — a paradox characteristic of economic crisis in a capitalist economy ; `` poverty in the midst"], [160, "A camel is an even-toed ungulate within the genus Camelus , bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as `` humps '' on its back . The two surviving species of camel are the dromedary , or one-humped camel ( C. dromedarius ) , which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa ; and the Bactrian , or two-humped camel ( C. bactrianus ) , which inhabits Central Asia . Both species have been domesticated ; they provide milk , meat , hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches , and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads .   The term camel is derived via Latin and Greek ( camelus and κάμηλος kamēlos respectively ) from Hebrew or Phoenician gāmāl .   `` Camel '' is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like mammals in the family Camelidae : the two true camels and the four New World camelids : the llama , alpaca , guanaco , and vicuña of South America .   Biology   The average life expectancy of a camel is 40 to 50 years . A full-grown adult camel stands at the shoulder and at the hump . Camels can run at up to 65 km/h in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to 40 km/h . Bactrian camels weigh 300 to and dromedaries 300 to .   The male dromedary camel has in its throat an organ called a dulla , a large , inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in rut to assert dominance and attract females . It resembles a long , swollen , pink tongue hanging out of the side of its mouth . Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground , with the male mounting from behind . The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session . Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position .   Ecological and behavioral adaptations   Camels do not directly store water in their humps as was once commonly believed . The humps are actually reservoirs of fatty tissue : concentrating body fat in their humps minimizes the insulating effect fat would have if distributed over the rest of their bodies , helping camels survive in hot climates . When this tissue is metabolized , it yields more than one gram of water for every gram of fat processed . This fat metabolization , while releasing energy , causes water to evaporate from the lungs during respiration ( as oxygen is required for the metabolic process ) : overall , there is a net decrease in water .   Camels have a series of physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand long periods of time without any external source of water . Unlike other mammals , their red blood cells are oval rather than circular in shape . This facilitates the flow of red blood cells during dehydration and makes them better at withstanding high osmotic variation without rupturing when drinking large amounts of water : a 600 kg camel can drink 200 L of water in three minutes .   Camels are able to withstand changes in body temperature and water consumption that would kill most other animals . Their temperature ranges from 34 °C at dawn and steadily increases to 40 °C by sunset , before they cool off at night again . Maintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for animals ; to assist this , camels have a rete mirabile , a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain . Camels rarely sweat , even when ambient temperatures reach 49 °C . Any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat ; the heat of vaporization therefore comes from body heat rather than ambient heat . Camels can withstand losing 25 % of their body weight to sweating , whereas most other mammals can withstand only about 12–14 % dehydration before cardiac failure results from circulatory disturbance .   When the camel exhales , water vapor becomes trapped in their nostrils and is reabsorbed into the body as a means to conserve water . Camels eating green herbage can ingest sufficient moisture in milder conditions to maintain their bodies ' hydrated state without the need for drinking .   The camels ' thick coats insulate them from the intense heat radiated from desert sand ; a shorn camel must sweat 50 % more to avoid overheating . During the summer the coat becomes lighter in"], [161, "Manitoba is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada . It is one of the three prairie provinces ( with Alberta and Saskatchewan ) and Canada 's fifth-most populous province with its estimated population of about 1.3 million people . Manitoba covers 649950 km2 with a widely varied landscape . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south .   Aboriginal peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived in the area when it was part of Rupert 's Land and owned by the Hudson 's Bay Company . In 1867 , negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the rebellion led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 , officially creating the province of Manitoba .   Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is Canada 's eighth-largest Census Metropolitan Area . Winnipeg is the seat of government , home to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and the Provincial Court . Four of the province 's five universities and all four of its professional sports teams are in Winnipeg .  Other cities in the province are Brandon , Portage la Prairie , Steinbach , Thompson , Winkler , Selkirk , Dauphin , Morden , and Flin Flon .   Etymology   The name Manitoba is believed to be derived from the Cree , Ojibwe or Assiniboine languages . The name derives from Cree manitou-wapow or Ojibwa manidoobaa , both meaning `` straits of Manitou , the Great Spirit '' , a place referring to what are now called The Narrows in the centre of Lake Manitoba . It may also be from the Assiniboine for `` Lake of the Prairie '' .   The lake was known to French explorers as Lac des Prairies . Thomas Spence chose the name to refer to a new republic he proposed for the area south of the lake . Métis leader Louis Riel also chose the name , and it was accepted in Ottawa under the Manitoba Act of 1870 .   Geography   Manitoba is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . It adjoins Hudson Bay to the northeast , and is the only prairie province to have a saltwater coastline . The Port of Churchill is the only arctic deep-water port in Canada and the shortest shipping route between North America and Asia . Lake Winnipeg is the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world . Hudson Bay is the second-largest bay in the world . Manitoba is at the heart of the giant Hudson Bay watershed , once known as Rupert 's Land . It was a vital area of the Hudson 's Bay Company , with many rivers and lakes that provided excellent opportunities for the lucrative fur trade .   Hydrography and terrain   The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and contains over 110,000 lakes , covering approximately 15.6 percent or 101593 km2 of its surface area . Manitoba 's major lakes are Lake Manitoba , Lake Winnipegosis , and Lake Winnipeg , the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world . Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on the east side of Lake Winnipeg are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site .   Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin , with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay . This basin 's rivers reach far west to the mountains , far south into the United States , and east into Ontario . Major watercourses include the Red , Assiniboine , Nelson , Winnipeg , Hayes , Whiteshell and Churchill rivers . Most of Manitoba 's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz . This region , particularly the Red River Valley , is flat and fertile ; there are hilly and rocky areas throughout the province left by receding glaciers .   Baldy Mountain is the province 's highest point at 832 m above sea level ,"], [162, "The Soham murders occurred in Soham , Cambridgeshire , England , on 4 August 2002 . The victims were two 10-year-old girls , Holly Marie Wells and Jessica Aimee Chapman . Their bodies were found near RAF Lakenheath , Suffolk , on 17 August 2002 , by a local farm worker .   Ian Kevin Huntley , a caretaker at local secondary school Soham Village College , was convicted on 17 December 2003 of the girls ' murder and sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment , with the High Court later setting a minimum term of 40 years .   His girlfriend , Maxine Ann Carr , was the girls ' teaching assistant at St Andrew 's Primary School . Carr had provided Huntley with a false alibi and received a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for perverting the course of justice .   Murders   On Sunday , 4 August 2002 , Wells and Chapman had attended a barbecue at Wells ' home in Redhouse Gardens , Soham . At around 6:15 pm , they went out to buy some sweets . On their way back they walked past the home of Ian Huntley , a secondary school caretaker , in College Close . Huntley saw the girls and asked them to come into his house . He said that his girlfriend , Maxine Carr , their teaching assistant at St Andrew 's Primary School , was in the house too . She had in fact gone to visit family in Grimsby , Lincolnshire . Shortly after the girls entered his house , Huntley murdered them .   Huntley 's motive for killing Wells and Chapman may never be known , but minutes before seeing them he had reportedly slammed the telephone down on Carr following a furious argument ; Huntley had allegedly suspected Carr of cheating on him . The police suspected that Huntley killed the girls in a fit of jealous rage . Huntley 's mother also said that she suspected this . The police found no evidence of premeditation .   Investigation   After the girls were reported missing , the police released photographs – taken only hours before their disappearance – of them wearing Manchester United replica football shirts and a physical description of each of them , describing them as `` white , about 4 ft 6 in tall and slim '' .   Meanwhile , over the next two weeks , Huntley appeared in several television interviews on Sky News and the BBC 's regional news programme Look East , speaking of the shock in the local community . One reporter suggested to Huntley that he may have been the last person to speak to the girls before they disappeared , to which Huntley replied : `` Yeah , that 's what it seems like . '' Huntley said their disappearance was `` absolutely '' a mystery and , during the second week of the search , he told television crews that `` while there 's no news there 's still that glimmer of hope , and that 's basically what we 're all hanging on to . ''   In the early days of the investigation , a woman living in the nearby village of Little Thetford claimed to have seen two girls whose appearance and clothing matched those of Wells and Chapman walking past her home on the morning after they were reported missing . Police also seized a white van from a caravan park in Wentworth , some 10 miles from Soham , on 7 August .   Police received information from a local taxi driver that the driver of a green car ( either a Peugeot 405 or Vauxhall Vectra ) was seen struggling with two children and driving `` erratically '' south of Soham and onto the Studlands Park housing estate in Newmarket on the evening the girls went missing . This sighting was made public on 13 August . That evening , a dog walker alerted police to two mounds of earth at Warren Hill , just outside Newmarket . The suggestion was that these might be the graves of the two missing girls . However , an overnight examination revealed that the mounds of earth were badger setts , and no trace of either girl was found .   Around the same time , police in Staffordshire claimed that the disappearance of the girls was linked to an abduction in the county the previous year , where a six-year-old girl had survived an attack by an abductor who was still at large and whose green Ford Mondeo was identified as having numberplates which had been stolen in Peterborough .

Rosario Dawson , Woody Harrelson , and Barry Pepper also star . The film was released in theaters in the United States and Canada on December 19 , 2008 , by Columbia Pictures . Despite receiving negative reviews , it was a box office success , grossing US $ 168,168,201 worldwide .   Plot   Tim Thomas ( Will Smith ) , while carelessly sending a text message while driving , veers across the center line into oncoming traffic and causes a multi-car crash in which seven people die : six strangers and his fiancée , Sarah Jenson ( Robinne Lee ) .   Two years later , in a bid for atonement , Tim sets out to save the lives of seven good people by donating his own vital organs , a process that will be completed after his planned suicide . A year after the crash , having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer , Tim donates a lung lobe to his brother Ben ( Michael Ealy ) , an IRS field agent . Tim then steals his brother 's federal IRS identification badge and credentials , puts his picture over Tim 's , identifies himself by his brother 's name , and uses Ben 's privileges to check out the financial backgrounds of further potential candidates for his donations . In each case he `` interviews '' them first to determine if they are good people .   In one case , the director of a hospice nursing home facility , who had an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant , seeks a six-month extension on his back taxes . Tim , now going by his brother 's name , is unsure of the man 's ethics , because he claims to be insolvent , yet drives a new BMW . To resolve the issue , `` Ben '' passionately asks a resident patient , an elderly bedridden woman , to tell him whether he is a `` good man '' , only to discover that the man is punishing the woman for refusing to take a new medication by not allowing the nurses to bathe her .   Six months later , `` Ben '' donates part of his liver to a Child Protective Services social worker named Holly ( Judyann Elder ) . He then finds George ( Bill Smitrovich ) , a junior hockey coach and donates a kidney to him . He then donates bone marrow to a young boy named Nicholas ( Quintin Kelley ) , opting to have no anesthesia during the procedure , an evident consequence of his desire for atonement . In each case he does not tell the people what his intentions are for his donations , despite being repeatedly asked .   Two weeks before he dies , he contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone `` in the system '' who needs and deserves help but is too proud to ask for it . Holly suggests Connie Tepos ( Elpidia Carrillo ) , who lives with her two kids and an abusive boyfriend , but ca n't afford to leave . When `` Ben '' arrives to `` interview '' her under the guise of dealing with the IRS , Connie is embarrassed and humiliated that he knows what 's been going on . She defends her boyfriend , is offended by `` Ben '' 's suggestion that she should leave with her kids , and kicks him out of her house . In the meantime , `` Ben '' moves out of his house and into a local motel , taking with him his pet box jellyfish—decidedly the most venomous creature on earth , with its sting causing death in three to five minutes . That night , after being beaten by her boyfriend again , Connie contacts `` Ben '' . He meets her , tells her not to be weak , and gives her the keys and directions to his beach house . She takes her two children and they move into the house . Then she reads a letter from `` Ben '' which includes the deed to the house , again giving no explanation , and asking for her to ( 1 ) respect his wishes , ( 2 ) not try to contact him , ( 3 ) not tell anyone how she got the house , and ( 4 ) `` live life abundantly '' .   `` Ben '' 's sixth candidate is Ezra Turner ( Woody Harrelson"], [164, "A planet is an astronomical object orbiting a star or stellar remnant that  * is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity ,  * is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion , and  * has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.This definition is drawn from two separate IAU declarations ; a formal definition agreed by the IAU in 2006 , and an informal working definition established by the IAU in 2001/2003 for objects outside of the Solar System . The official 2006 definition applies only to the Solar System , whereas the 2003 definition applies to planets around other stars . The extrasolar planet issue was deemed too complex to resolve at the 2006 IAU conference .  The term planet is ancient , with ties to history , astrology , science , mythology , and religion . Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye . These were regarded by many early cultures as divine , or as emissaries of deities . As scientific knowledge advanced , human perception of the planets changed , incorporating a number of disparate objects . In 2006 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System . This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit . Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain `` planets '' under the modern definition , some celestial bodies , such as Ceres , Pallas , Juno and Vesta ( each an object in the solar asteroid belt ) , and Pluto ( the first trans-Neptunian object discovered ) , that were once considered planets by the scientific community , are no longer viewed as such .   The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions . Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times , it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations , performed by Galileo Galilei . By careful analysis of the observation data , Johannes Kepler found the planets ' orbits were not circular but elliptical . As observational tools improved , astronomers saw that , like Earth , the planets rotated around tilted axes , and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons . Since the dawn of the Space Age , close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism , hurricanes , tectonics , and even hydrology .   Planets are generally divided into two main types : large low-density giant planets , and smaller rocky terrestrials . Under IAU definitions , there are eight planets in the Solar System . In order of increasing distance from the Sun , they are the four terrestrials , Mercury , Venus , Earth , and Mars , then the four giant planets , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune . Six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites .   More than two thousand planets around other stars ( `` extrasolar planets '' or `` exoplanets '' ) have been discovered in the Milky Way . As of , known extrasolar planets in planetary systems ( including multiple planetary systems ) , ranging in size from just above the size of the Moon to gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter have been discovered , out of which more than 100 planets are the same size as Earth , nine of which are at the same relative distance from their star as Earth from the Sun , i.e . in the habitable zone . On December 20 , 2011 , the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets , Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f , orbiting a Sun-like star , Kepler-20 . A 2012 study , analyzing gravitational microlensing data , estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way .  Around one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone .   History   The word `` planet '' derives from the Ancient Greek ἀστήρ πλανήτης astēr planētēs , or πλάνης ἀστήρ plánēs astēr , which means `` wandering star , '' and originally referred to those objects in the night sky that moved relative to one another , as opposed to the `` fixed stars '' , which maintained a constant relative position in the sky .

The tournament is the modern version of one of the oldest tennis championships in the world , the U.S. National Championship , for which men 's singles was first contested in 1881 . Since 1987 , the US Open has been chronologically the fourth and final tennis major comprising the Grand Slam each year ; the other three , in chronological order , are the Australian Open , the French Open and Wimbledon .   The US Open is held annually , starting on the last Monday in August , and lasting for two weeks into September , with the middle weekend coinciding with the Labor Day holiday . The main tournament consists of five event championships : men 's and women 's singles , men 's and women 's doubles , and mixed doubles , with additional tournaments for senior , junior , and wheelchair players . Since 1978 , the tournament has been played on acrylic hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park , Queens , New York City . The US Open is owned and organized by the United States Tennis Association ( USTA ) , a not-for-profit organization . Net proceeds from ticket sales , sponsorships , and television deals are used to promote the development of tennis in the United States .   The US Open is the only Grand Slam that employs tiebreakers in every set of a match . For the other three Grand Slam events , if a match goes to the last set ( the third for women , fifth for men ) and there is a 6–6 tie , the match continues until one player wins by two games ( i.e . 8-6 , 9-7 , 10-8 , etc . ) , while in all four Grand Slam events , the sets played before the last set always employ tiebreakers should a set reach 6-6 .   History   Newport Casino   The tournament was first held in August 1881 on the grass courts at the Newport Casino , Newport , Rhode Island and in that first year only clubs that were members of the United States National Lawn Tennis Association ( USNLTA ) were permitted to enter . The first edition was won by Richard Sears , who went on to win seven consecutive singles titles . From 1884 through 1911 , the tournament used a challenge system whereby the defending champion automatically qualified for the next year 's final in which he would play the winner of the all-comers tournament . In 1915 the national championship was relocated from Newport , Rhode Island to the West Side Tennis Club at Forest Hills , New York ; as early as 1911 an effort was made by a group of tennis players , headed by Karl Behr from New York , to relocate the tournament to New York .   West Side Tennis Club   In early 1915 the issue resurfaced when a group of about 100 tennis players signed a petition in favor of the move , arguing that most tennis clubs , players and fans were located in the New York area and that it would therefore be beneficial for the development of the sport to host the national championship there . This view was opposed by another group of players which included eight former national singles champions . The contentious issue was brought to a vote at the annual USNLTA meeting on February 5 , 1915 and with 128 votes in favor and 119 against it was decided to relocate .   From 1921 through 1923 , the tournament was played at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia . It returned to Forest Hills in 1924 following the completion of the newly constructed 14,000 seat concrete Forest Hills Stadium . Though regarded unofficially by many as a major championship beforehand , the tournament was officially designated as one of the major tournaments by the ILTF commencing in 1924 .   In the first few years of the United States National Championship only men competed and the tournament was known as the US National Singles Championships for Men . Six years after the men 's nationals were first held , the first official U.S. Women 's National Singles Championship was held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in 1887 , won by 17-year-old Philadelphian Ellen Hansell , accompanied by the U.S. Women 's National Doubles Championship ( not held for the next two years ) and U.S. Mixed Doubles Championship ( not held in 1899 ) . The women 's tournament used a challenge system from 1888 through 1918 ,"], [166, "In psychoanalysis , the Oedipus complex ( or , less commonly , Oedipal complex ) is a child 's desire , that the mind keeps in the unconscious via dynamic repression , to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex ( i.e . males attracted to their mothers , and females attracted to their fathers ) .   The Oedipus complex occurs in the third — phallic stage ( ages 3–6 ) — of the five psychosexual development stages : ( i ) the oral , ( ii ) the anal , ( iii ) the phallic , ( iv ) the latent , and ( v ) the genital — in which the source of libidinal pleasure is in a different erogenous zone of the infant 's body . The Oedipal complex originally refers to the sexual desire of a son for his mother and does not have to be reciprocated .   Sigmund Freud , who coined the term `` Oedipus complex '' , believed that the Oedipus complex is a desire for the parent in both males and females ; he deprecated the term `` Electra complex '' , which was introduced by Carl Gustav Jung in regard to the Oedipus complex manifested in young girls . Freud further proposed that boys and girls experience the complex differently : boys in a form of castration anxiety , girls in a form of penis envy ; and that unsuccessful resolution of the complex might lead to neurosis , pedophilia , and homosexuality . A child 's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the complex .   Men and women who are fixated in the Oedipal and Electra stages of their psychosexual development might be considered `` mother-fixated '' and `` father-fixated . '' In adult life , this can lead to a choice of a sexual partner who resembles one 's parent .   Background   Oedipus refers to a 5th-century BC Greek mythological character Oedipus , who unwittingly kills his father , Laius , and marries his mother , Jocasta . A play based on the myth , Oedipus Rex , was written by Sophocles , ca . 429 BC .   Modern productions of Sophocles ' play were staged in Paris and Vienna in the 19th century and were phenomenally successful in the 1880s and 1890s . The Austrian psychiatrist , Sigmund Freud ( 1856–1939 ) , attended . In his book The Interpretation of Dreams first published in 1899 , he proposed that an Oedipal desire is a universal , psychological phenomenon innate ( phylogenetic ) to human beings , and the cause of much unconscious guilt . He based this on his analysis of his feelings attending the play , his anecdotal observations of neurotic or normal children , and on the fact that Oedipus Rex was effective on both ancient and modern audiences . ( He also claimed the play Hamlet “ has its roots in the same soil as Oedipus Rex , ” and that the differences between the two plays are revealing . “ In [ Oedipus Rex ] the child ’ s wishful fantasy that underlies it is brought into the open and realized as it would be in a dream . In Hamlet it remains repressed ; and — just as in the case of a neurosis — we only learn of its existence from its inhibiting consequences . ” )   However , in The Interpretation of Dreams , Freud makes it clear that the “ primordial urges and fears ” that are his concern and the basis of the Oedipal complex are inherent in the myths the play by Sophocles is based on , not primarily in the play itself , which Freud refers to as a “ further modification of the legend ” that originates in a “ misconceived secondary revision of the material , which has sought to exploit it for theological purposes . ”   Freud described the character Oedipus :   A six-stage chronology of Sigmund Freud 's theoretic evolution of the Oedipus complex is :   * Stage 1 . 1897–1909 . After his father 's death in 1896 , and having seen the play Oedipus Rex , by Sophocles , Freud begins using the term `` Oedipus '' . As Freud wrote in a 1897 letter , `` I found in myself a constant love for my mother , and jealousy of my father . I now consider this to be a universal event in early childhood . ''  * Stage 2 . 1909–1914 .

Henman played a serve-and-volley style of tennis . He was the first male player from the United Kingdom since Roger Taylor in the 1970s to reach the semi-finals of the Wimbledon Men 's Singles Championship . Henman never reached the finals of any Grand Slam but reached six Grand Slam semifinals and won 15 career ATP titles ( 11 in singles and four in doubles ) , including the Paris Masters in 2003 . Also , he scored 40 wins and 14 losses with the Great Britain Davis Cup team .   He was ranked British number 1 in 1996 and again from 1999 to 2005 , from which point he was succeeded by Andy Murray . He reached a career high ranking of World No . 4 during three different periods between July 2002 and October 2004 . He is one of Britain 's most successful open era male tennis players , winning $ 11,635,542 prize money .   Henman started playing tennis before the age of three , and began systematic training in the Slater Squad at eleven . After suffering a serious injury which affected him for the better part of two years , he began touring internationally as a junior and achieved some successes . He rose quickly up the ATP rankings , and by 1996 had reached the quarter-finals of the Wimbledon Championships . Throughout his career , Henman was a noted grass specialist , only becoming truly comfortable on clay and hard court before the end of his career , when in 2004 he reached the semi-finals in both the French and US Open . The year 2005 began a decline for Henman , and from that year onwards he never managed to pass through the third round in a Grand Slam tournament . Henman retired from professional tennis in late 2007 , but he remains active in the ATP Champions Tour ( a tour for former professional tennis players ) .   Early life   Henman was born in Oxford , Oxfordshire , as the youngest boy in a family of three boys . Henman 's father Tony , a solicitor , was accomplished at various sports , including tennis , hockey and squash . His mother Jane , a dress designer , played Junior Wimbledon and introduced Tim and his elder brothers Michael and Richard to tennis as soon as they could walk on the family 's grass tennis court . His great grandfather played at Wimbledon . His maternal grandfather , Henry Billington , played at Wimbledon between 1948 and 1951 , and he represented Britain in the Davis Cup in 1948 , 1950 and 1951 . In 1901 his maternal great-grandmother , Ellen Stanwell-Brown , was reputedly the first woman to serve overarm at Wimbledon . His maternal grandmother , Susan Billington , appeared regularly at Wimbledon in the 1950s , playing mixed doubles on Centre Court with her husband Henry , reaching the third round of the ladies ' doubles in 1951 , 1955 and 1956 .   Henman grew up in Weston-on-the-Green , Oxfordshire , a village between Oxford and Bicester with a population of around 500 . At home , the family owned a grass tennis court in their back garden . Henman began playing tennis before the age of three with a shortened squash racket . At this stage , he was already teaching himself how to serve and volley . At an early stage in his life , Henman decided if he did not succeed in tennis , he would become a golf player instead .   Henman attended the Longbridge School for boys between the ages of five and seven , and was enrolled in the private Dragon School in Oxford from seven to 11 . He excelled in all sports but was always best at tennis . But Henman was small for his age , a factor which would bode against him in the future . In 1985 , he was appointed the school 's captain of tennis and led the school 's tennis team to win 21 out of 27 matches . He remains to this day the only pupil who has won both the school 's junior and senior tennis tournaments in the same year . From the age of eight until his introduction to the Slater Squad , Henman received coaching from the David Lloyd Tennis Centre , where he was given personal lessons by former professional player Onny Parun from New Zealand . In retrospect , Parun stated that Henman 's greatest strength `` had always been his head .

The term `` Impressionism '' is derived from the title of his painting Impression , soleil levant ( Impression , Sunrise ) , which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris .   Monet 's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons . From 1883 Monet lived in Giverny , where he purchased a house and property , and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works . In 1899 he began painting the water lilies , first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature , and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life .   Monet and Impressionism   First `` Impressionist '' exhibition   From the late 1860s , Monet and other like-minded artists met with rejection from the conservative Académie des Beaux-Arts , which held its annual exhibition at the Salon de Paris . During the latter part of 1873 , Monet , Pierre-Auguste Renoir , Camille Pissarro , and Alfred Sisley organized the Société anonyme des artistes peintres , sculpteurs et graveurs ( Anonymous Society of Painters , Sculptors , and Engravers ) to exhibit their artworks independently . At their first exhibition , held in April 1874 , Monet exhibited the work that was to give the group its lasting name .   Impression , Sunrise was painted in 1872 , depicting a Le Havre port landscape . From the painting 's title the art critic Louis Leroy , in his review , `` L'Exposition des Impressionnistes , '' which appeared in Le Charivari , coined the term `` Impressionism '' . It was intended as disparagement but the Impressionists appropriated the term for themselves .   Biography   Birth and childhood   Claude Monet was born on 14 November 1840 on the fifth floor of 45 rue Laffitte , in the 9th arrondissement of Paris . He was the second son of Claude Adolphe Monet and Louise Justine Aubrée Monet , both of them second-generation Parisians . On 20 May 1841 , he was baptized in the local parish church , Notre-Dame-de-Lorette , as Oscar-Claude , but his parents called him simply Oscar . ( He signed his juvenilia `` O. Monet '' . ) Despite being baptized Catholic , Monet later became an atheist .   In 1845 , his family moved to Le Havre in Normandy . His father wanted him to go into the family grocery business , but Monet wanted to become an artist . His mother was a singer .   On 1 April 1851 , Monet entered Le Havre secondary school of the arts . Locals knew him well for his charcoal caricatures , which he would sell for ten to twenty francs . Monet also undertook his first drawing lessons from Jacques-François Ochard , a former student of Jacques-Louis David . On the beaches of Normandy around 1856 he met fellow artist Eugène Boudin , who became his mentor and taught him to use oil paints . Boudin taught Monet `` en plein air '' ( outdoor ) techniques for painting . [ http : //www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_165.html Biography for Claude Monet ] Guggenheim Collection .

At the age of sixteen , he left school and went to live with his widowed , childless aunt , Marie-Jeanne Lecadre .   Paris and Algeria   When Monet traveled to Paris to visit the Louvre , he witnessed painters copying from the old masters . Having brought his paints and other tools with him , he would instead go and sit by a window and paint what he saw . Monet was in Paris for several years and met other young painters , including Édouard Manet and others who would become friends and fellow Impressionists .   After drawing a low ballot number in March 1861 , Monet was drafted into the First Regiment of African Light Cavalry ( Chasseurs d'Afrique )"], [169, "The Argentine Navy or Navy of the Argentine Republic or Armada of the Argentine Republic ( — ARA , also Armada Argentina ) is the navy of Argentina . It is one of the three branches of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic , together with the Army and the Air Force . Each ship of the Argentine Navy is designated with the prefix `` ARA '' before its name .   The Argentine Navy day is celebrated on May 17 , anniversary of the victory achieved in 1814 in the Battle of Montevideo over the Spanish fleet during the war of Independence .   History   19th century   The Argentine Navy was created in the aftermath of the May Revolution of May 25 , 1810 , which started the war for independence from Spain . The navy was first created to support Manuel Belgrano in the Paraguay campaign , but it was sunk by ships from Montevideo , and did not take part in that conflict . Renewed conflicts with Montevideo led to the creation of a second fleet , which participated in the capture of the city . As Buenos Aires had little maritime history , most men in the navy were from other nations , such as the Irish-born admiral William Brown , who directed the operation . As the cost of maintaining a navy was too high , most of the Argentine naval forces were composed of privateers .   Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata .   In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself . At the close of the century , the force included :   * 5 armoured cruisers  * 4 coastal defence ironclads  * 3 second-class , high-speed , British-built cruisers  * 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats  * 4 destroyers and  * 22 torpedo boats .   The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships : , , and , each at over 6,000 tons . Three older ironclads , , , and dated from the 1880s and early 1890s .   The navy 's ships were built primarily in Italy , Britain , France , and Spain and were operated by over 600 officers and 7760 seamen . These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery .   20th century   Argentina remained neutral in both world wars . In 1940 , Argentina 's navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world ( after the European powers , Japan , and the United States ) and the largest in Latin America . A ten-year building programme costing $ 60 million had produced a force of 14,500 sailors and over a thousand officers . The fleet included two First World War-era ( but modernized ) American-built s , three modern cruisers , a dozen British-built destroyers , and three submarines in addition to minelayers , minesweepers , coastal defence ships , and gunboats . A naval air force was also in operation .   In the postwar period , Naval Aviation and Marine Corps units were put under direct Navy command . With Brazil , Argentina is one of two South American countries to have operated two aircraft carriers : the and .   The Argentine Navy has been traditionally heavily involved in fishery inspection helping the Coast Guard : most notably in 1966 a destroyer fired on and holed a Soviet trawler that had refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata , in the 1970s there were four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships and continued in recent years .   The Navy also took part in all military coups through the 20th century . During the last dictatorship , Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War of the late 1970s in which thousands of people were kidnapped , tortured and killed by the forces of the Military Junta . The Naval Mechanics School , known as ESMA , was a notorious centre for torture . Among their more well-known victims were the Swedish teenager Dagmar Hagelin and French nuns , Alice Domon and Léonie Duquet ( In October 2007 the Argentine Navy formally handed possession of the school to human rights groups to turn into a memorial museum ) . During this regime , the Navy was also the main supporter of a military solution for the country 's two longest standing disputes : the Beagle Conflict with Chile and the Falkland Islands ( ) with the United Kingdom .

The series is set primarily in the West Wing of the White House , where the Oval Office and offices of presidential senior staff are located , during the fictitious Democratic administration of Josiah Bartlet ( played by Martin Sheen ) .   The West Wing was produced by Warner Bros. Television . For the first four seasons , there were three executive producers : Aaron Sorkin ( lead writer of almost all of the first four seasons ) ; Thomas Schlamme ( primary director ) ; and John Wells .

When"], [171, "Communist propaganda in the Soviet Union was extensively based on the Marxism-Leninism ideology to promote the Communist Party line . In societies with pervasive censorship , the propaganda was omnipresent and very efficient . It penetrated even social and natural sciences giving rise to various pseudo-scientific theories like Lysenkoism , whereas fields of real knowledge , as genetics , cybernetics , and comparative linguistics were condemned and forbidden as `` bourgeois pseudoscience '' . With `` truths repressed , falsehoods in every field were incessantly rubbed in print , at endless meetings , in school , in mass demonstrations , on the radio '' .   The main Soviet censorship body , Glavlit , was employed not only to eliminate any undesirable printed materials , but also `` to ensure that the correct ideological spin was put on every published item '' . Telling anything against the `` Party line '' was punished by imprisonment or through punitive psychiatry . `` Today a man only talks freely to his wife – at night , with the blankets pulled over his head '' , said writer Isaac Babel privately to a trusted friend .   Theory of Propaganda   According to historian Peter Kenez , `` the Russian socialists have contributed nothing to the theoretical discussion of the techniques of mass persuasion . ... The Bolsheviks never looked for and did not find devilishly clever methods to influence people 's minds , to brainwash them . '' This lack of interest , says Kenez , `` followed from their notion of propaganda . They thought of propaganda as part of education . ''   Media   Schools and youth organizations   An important goal of Communist propaganda was to create a new man . Schools and the Communist youth organizations , like Soviet pioneers and Komsomol , served to remove children from the `` petit-bourgeois '' family and indoctrinate the next generation into the collective way of life . The idea that the upbringing of children was the concern of their parents was explicitly rejected .   One schooling theorist stated :  We must make the young into a generation of Communists . Children , like soft wax , are very malleable and they should be moulded into good Communists ... We must rescue children from the harmful influence of the family ... We must nationalize them . From the earliest days of their little lives , they must find themselves under the beneficent influence of Communist schools ... To oblige the mother to give her child to the Soviet state – that is our task . `` .   Those born after the Revolution were explicitly told that they were to build a utopia of brotherhood and justice , and to not be like their parents , but completely Red .  `` Lenin 's corners '' , `` political shrines for the display of propaganda about the god-like founder of the Soviet state '' have been established in all schools . Schools conducted marches , songs and pledges of allegiance to Soviet leadership . One of purposes was to instill in children the idea that they are involved in the World revolution , which is more important than any family ties . Pavlik Morozov , who betrayed his father to the secret police NKVD , was promoted as a great positive example .   Teachers in economic and social sciences were particularly responsible for inculcating `` unshakable '' Marxist-Leninist views .   All teachers were prone to follow , strictly , the plan for educating children approved by top for reasons of safety , which could cause serious problems dealing with social events that , having just happened , were not included in the plan . Children of `` socially alien '' elements were often the target of abuse or expelled , in the name of class struggle . Early in the regime , many teachers were drawn into Communist plans for schooling because of a passion for literacy and numeracy , which the Communists were attempting to spread .   Young Pioneers , the youth group , was an important factor in the indoctrination of children . They were taught to be truthful and uncompromising and to fight the enemies of socialism . By the 1930s , this indoctrination completely dominated the Young Pioneers .   Radio   Radio was put to good use , especially to reach the illiterate ; radio receivers were put in communal locations , where the peasants would have to come to hear news , such as changes to rationing , and received propaganda broadcasts with it ; some of these locations were also used for posters .

The city lies on the Sunzha River . According to the 2010 Census , it had a population of 271,573 ; up from 210,720 recorded in the 2002 Census , but still only about two-thirds of 399,688 recorded in the 1989 Census .   Names   In Russian , `` Grozny '' means `` fearsome '' , `` awesome '' , or `` redoubtable '' , the same word as in Ivan Grozny or Ivan the Terrible . While the official name in Chechen is the same , informally the city is known as `` '' , which literally means `` the city ( ) on the Sunzha River ( ) '' .   In 1996 , during the First Chechen War , the Chechen separatists renamed the city Dzokhar-Ghala ( ) , or Dzhokhar/Djohar for short , after Dzhokhar Dudayev , the first President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria . In December 2005 , the Chechen parliament voted to rename the city `` Akhmadkala '' ( after Akhmad Kadyrov ) —a proposition which was rejected by his son Ramzan Kadyrov , the prime minister and later President of the republic .   History   Russian fort   The fortress of Groznaya ( ; lit . fearsome ) was founded in 1818 as a Russian military outpost on the Sunzha River by general Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov . As the fort was being built the workers were fired upon by the Chechens . The Russians solved the problem by placing a cannon at a carefully chosen point outside the walls . When night fell and the Chechens came out of their hiding places to drag the gun away all the other guns opened up with grapeshot . When the Chechens recovered their senses and began to carry away the bodies the guns fired again . When it was over 200 dead were counted . Thus did the 'terrible ' fort receive its baptism of fire . It was a prominent defense center during the Caucasian War . After the annexation of the region by the Russian Empire , the military use of the old fortress was obsolete and in December 1869 it was renamed Grozny and granted town status .

А. , `` Записки краеведа '' , Чечено-Ингушское книжное издательство , Грозный,1984 ] As most of the residents there were Terek Cossacks , the town grew slowly until the development of oil reserves in the early 20th century . This encouraged the rapid development of industry and petrochemical production . In addition to the oil drilled in the city itself , the city became a geographical center of Russia 's network of oil fields , and in 1893 became part of the Transcaucasia — Russia Proper railway . The result was the population almost doubled from 15,600 in 1897 to 30,400 in 1913 .   Soviet regional capital   One day after the October Revolution , on November 8 , 1917 , the Bolsheviks headed by N. Anisimov seized Grozny . As the Russian Civil War escalated , the Proletariat formed the 12th Red Army , and the garrison held out against numerous attacks by Terek Cossacks from August 11 to November 12 , 1918 . However , with the arrival of Denikin 's armies , the Bolsheviks were forced to withdraw and Grozny was captured on February 4 , 1919 by the White Army . Underground operations were carried out , but only the arrival of the Caucasus front of the Red Army in 1920 allowed the city to permanently end up with the Russian SFSR on March 17 . Simultaneously it became part of the Soviet Mountain Republic , which was formed on January 20 , 1921 , and was the capital of the Chechen National Okrug inside it .   On November 30 , 1922 , the mountain republic was dissolved , and the national okrug became the Chechen Autonomous Oblast ( Chechen AO ) with Grozny as the administrative center . At this time most of the population was still Russian , but of Cossack descent . As Cossacks were viewed as a potential threat to the Soviet nation , Moscow actively encouraged the migration of Chechens into the city from the mountains . In 1934 the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Oblast was formed , becoming the Chechen-Ingush ASSR in 1936 .   In 1944 , the entire population of Chechens and Ingush was deported after rebelling against Soviet rule . Large amounts of people who were not deemed fit for transport were 'liquidated ' on spot , [ http : //www.history.neu.edu/fac/burds/Burds-FifthColumnists.pdf `` The Soviet War against"], [174, "Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill , ( 30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965 ) was a British statesman who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955 . Churchill was also an officer in the British Army , a non-academic historian , a writer ( as Winston S. Churchill ) , and an artist . He won the Nobel Prize in Literature , and was the first person to be made an honorary citizen of the United States .   Churchill was born into the family of the Dukes of Marlborough , a branch of the Spencer family . His father , Lord Randolph Churchill , was a charismatic politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer ; his mother , Jennie Jerome , was an American socialite . As a young army officer , he saw action in British India , the Anglo–Sudan War , and the Second Boer War . He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote books about his campaigns .   At the forefront of politics for fifty years , he held many political and cabinet positions . Before the First World War , he served as President of the Board of Trade , Home Secretary , and First Lord of the Admiralty as part of Asquith 's Liberal government . During the war , he continued as First Lord of the Admiralty until the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign caused his departure from government . He then briefly resumed active army service on the Western Front as commander of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers . He returned to government under Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions , Secretary of State for War , Secretary of State for Air , then Secretary of State for the Colonies . After two years out of Parliament , he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Baldwin 's Conservative government of 1924–1929 , controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity , a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy .   Out of office and politically `` in the wilderness '' during the 1930s because of his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII , Churchill took the lead in warning about Nazi Germany and in campaigning for rearmament . At the outbreak of the Second World War , he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty . Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940 , Churchill became Prime Minister . His speeches and radio broadcasts helped inspire British resistance , especially during the difficult days of 1940–41 when the British Commonwealth and Empire stood almost alone in its active opposition to Adolf Hitler . He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured .   After the Conservative Party lost the 1945 election , he became Leader of the Opposition to the Labour Government . He publicly warned of an `` Iron Curtain '' of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity . After winning the 1951 election , Churchill again became Prime Minister . His second term was preoccupied by foreign affairs , including the Malayan Emergency , Mau Mau Uprising , Korean War , and a UK-backed coup d'état in Iran . Domestically his government laid great emphasis on house-building . Churchill suffered a serious stroke in 1953 and retired as Prime Minister in 1955 , although he remained a Member of Parliament until 1964 . Upon his death aged ninety in 1965 , Elizabeth II granted him the honour of a state funeral , which saw one of the largest assemblies of world statesmen in history . Named the Greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll , Churchill is widely regarded as being among the most influential people in British history , consistently ranking well in opinion polls of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom .   Family and early life   Born into the aristocratic family of the Dukes of Marlborough , a branch of the noble Spencer family , Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill , like his father , used the surname `` Churchill '' in public life . His ancestor George Spencer had changed his surname to Spencer-Churchill in 1817 when he became Duke of Marlborough , to highlight his descent from John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough . Churchill 's father , Lord Randolph Churchill , the third son of John Spencer-Churchill , 7th Duke of Marlborough , was a politician ; and his mother , Lady Randolph Churchill ( Jennie Jerome ) was the daughter of American millionaire"], [175, "Star Trek is an American science fiction entertainment franchise created by Gene Roddenberry and owned by CBS and Paramount Pictures.For a more detailed history of the ownership of the franchise , see the corporate ownership section . The television series Star Trek : The Original Series , Star Trek : The Animated Series , See the Canon issues section of the The Animated Series page for more details . Star Trek : The Next Generation , Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Star Trek : Voyager , Star Trek : Enterprise , Star Trek : Discovery as well as the Star Trek film franchise make up the franchise 's canon .   The first series , now referred to as The Original Series , debuted in 1966 and ran for three seasons on NBC . It followed the galactic adventures of James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship Enterprise , an exploration vessel of a 23rd-century interstellar `` United Federation of Planets '' . In creating the first Star Trek , Roddenberry was inspired by Westerns such as Wagon Train , the Horatio Hornblower novels and Gulliver 's Travels . In fact , the original series was originally described as Wagon Train to the Stars . These adventures continued in the short-lived Star Trek : The Animated Series and six feature films . Four spin-off television series were eventually produced : Star Trek : The Next Generation followed the crew of a new starship Enterprise set a century after the original series ; Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Star Trek : Voyager , set contemporaneously with The Next Generation ; and Star Trek : Enterprise , set before the original series , in the early days of human interstellar travel . Four additional The Next Generation feature films were produced . In 2009 , the film franchise underwent a `` reboot '' set in an alternate timeline , the `` Kelvin Timeline '' , titled simply Star Trek . This film featured a new cast portraying younger versions of the crew from the original show . A sequel to that film , Star Trek Into Darkness , premiered on May 16 , 2013 . A thirteenth film feature and sequel , Star Trek Beyond , was released in July 2016 , to coincide with the franchise 's 50th anniversary . A new Star Trek TV series , titled Star Trek : Discovery , will premiere in January 2017 on the digital platform CBS All Access .   Star Trek has been a cult phenomenon for decades . Fans of the franchise are called Trekkies or Trekkers . The franchise spans a wide range of spin-offs including games , figurines , novels , toys , and comics . Star Trek had a themed attraction in Las Vegas that opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008 . At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world . The series has its own full-fledged constructed language , Klingon . Several parodies have been made of Star Trek . In addition , viewers have produced several fan productions .   Star Trek is noted for its influence on the world outside of science fiction . It has been cited as an inspiration for several technological inventions , including the cell phone and tablet computers . The franchise is also noted for its progressive civil rights stances . The Original Series included one of television 's first multiracial casts . Star Trek references can be found throughout popular culture from movies such as the submarine thriller Crimson Tide to the animated series South Park .   Conception and setting   As early as 1964 , Gene Roddenberry drafted a proposal for the science-fiction series that would become Star Trek . Although he publicly marketed it as a Western in outer space—a so-called `` Wagon Train to the Stars '' ( like the popular Western TV series ) —he privately told friends that he was modeling it on Jonathan Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels , intending each episode to act on two levels : as a suspenseful adventure story and as a morality tale .   Most Star Trek stories depict the adventures of humansMembers of the human species are occasionally called `` Terrans '' in Star Trek , although usage has been inconsistent . and aliens who serve in Starfleet , the space-borne humanitarian and peacekeeping armada of the United Federation of Planets . The protagonists have altruistic values , and must apply these ideals to difficult dilemmas .   Many of the conflicts and political dimensions of Star Trek represent allegories of contemporary cultural realities .

The sequel , Yes , Prime Minister , ran from 1986 to 1988 . In total there were 39 episodes , of which all but two lasted half an hour . Several episodes were adapted for BBC Radio , and a stage play was produced in 2010 , the latter leading to a new television series on UKTV Gold in 2013 .   Set principally in the private office of a British Cabinet minister in the fictional Department of Administrative Affairs in Whitehall , Yes Minister follows the ministerial career of the Rt Hon Jim Hacker MP , played by Paul Eddington . His various struggles to formulate and enact legislation or effect departmental changes are opposed by the British Civil Service , in particular his Permanent Secretary , Sir Humphrey Appleby , played by Sir Nigel Hawthorne . His Principal Private Secretary Bernard Woolley , played by Derek Fowlds , is usually caught between the two . The sequel , Yes , Prime Minister , continued with the same cast and followed the events of the premiership of Jim Hacker after his unexpected elevation to Number 10 upon the resignation of the previous Prime Minister .   The series received a number of awards , including several BAFTAs and in 2004 was voted sixth in the Britain 's Best Sitcom poll . It was the favourite television programme of the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Margaret Thatcher .   Situation   The series opens in the wake of a general election in which the incumbent government has been defeated by the opposition party , to which Jim Hacker MP belongs . His party affiliation is never stated , and his party emblem is clearly neither Conservative nor Labour . The Prime Minister offers Hacker the position of Minister of Administrative Affairs , which he accepts . Hacker goes to his department and meets his Permanent Secretary , Sir Humphrey Appleby , and his Principal Private Secretary , Bernard Woolley . While Appleby is outwardly deferential towards the new minister , he is prepared to defend the status quo at all costs . Woolley is sympathetic towards Hacker but as Appleby reminds him , his civil servant superiors will have much to say about the course of his future career , while ministers do not usually stay long in one department . Many of the episodes revolve around proposals backed by Hacker but frustrated by Appleby , and others revolve around proposals promoted by the latter but rejected by Hacker , which Appleby attempts by all means necessary to persuade Hacker to accept . They do occasionally join forces in order to achieve a common goal , such as preventing the closure of their department or dealing with a diplomatic incident .   As the series revolves around the inner workings of central government , most of the scenes take place in private locations , such as offices and exclusive members ' clubs . Lynn says that `` there was not a single scene set in the House of Commons because government does not take place in the House of Commons . Some politics and much theatre takes place there . Government happens in private . As in all public performances , the real work is done in rehearsal , behind closed doors . Then the public and the House are shown what the government wishes them to see . '' However , the episode `` The Compassionate Society '' does feature an audio recording of Yesterday in Parliament in which Hacker speaks in the House of Commons , and other episodes include scenes in the Foreign Secretary 's House of Commons office ( `` The Writing on the Wall '' ) and a Committee room ( `` A Question of Loyalty '' ) . At the time of the making of the series , television cameras were not allowed in the House of Commons and had only recently been introduced into the House of Lords , so it was not unusual to a British audience to have no scenes from there .   Character contrast   The different ideals and self-interested motives of the characters are frequently contrasted . Whilst Hacker occasionally approaches an issue from a sense of idealism and a desire to be seen to improve things , he ultimately sees his re-election and elevation to higher office as the key measures of his success . Accordingly , he must appear to the voters to be effective and responsive to the public will ."], [177, "The British threepence ( 3d ) coin , usually simply known as a threepence or threepenny bit , was a unit of currency equaling one eightieth of a pound sterling , or three pence sterling . It was used in the United Kingdom , and earlier in Great Britain and England . Similar denominations were later used throughout the British Empire , notably in Australia , New Zealand , and South Africa .   The sum of three pence was pronounced variously , or , reflecting different pronunciations in the various regions and nations of the United Kingdom . Likewise , the coin was often referred to in conversation as a , or bit .   Before Decimal Day in 1971 there were two hundred and forty pence in one pound sterling . Twelve pence made a shilling , and twenty shillings made a pound . Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence , e.g . forty-two pence would be three shillings and six pence ( 3/6 ) , pronounced `` three and six '' . Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence , e.g . eight pence would be 8d .   Early threepences   The three pence coin – expressed in writing as `` 3d '' – first appeared in England during the fine silver coinage of King Edward VI ( 1547–53 ) , when it formed part of a set of new denominations . Although it was an easy denomination to work with in the context of the old sterling coinage system , being a quarter of a shilling , initially it was not popular with the public who preferred the groat ( four pence ) . Hence the coin was not minted in the following two reigns .   Edward VI threepences were struck at the London and York mints . The obverse shows a front-facing bust of the king , with a rose to the left and the value numeral III to the right , surrounded by the legend . The reverse shows a long cross over the royal shield , surrounded by the legend ( London mint ) ( I have made God my helper ) , or ( York mint ) ( City of York ) .   Queen Elizabeth I ( 1558–1603 ) produced threepences during her third coinage ( 1561–1577 ) . Most 1561 issues are 21 mm in diameter , while later ones are 19 mm in diameter . These coins are identifiable from other denominations by the rose behind the queen 's head on the obverse , and the date on the reverse . The obverse shows a left-facing crowned bust of the queen with a rose behind her , surrounded by the legend , while the reverse shows shield over a long cross , dated 1561 , surrounded by the legend . Dates used for the smaller coins were 1561–77 . Threepences of the fourth coinage ( 1578–1582 ) are identical except for having a slightly lower silver content . There was also a fairly rare milled coinage threepence , produced between 1561 and 1564 with similar designs and inscriptions to the hammered coinage threepences .   The threepence denomination fell out of use again during the reign of King James I , while during King Charles I 's reign ( 1625–49 ) it was not produced at the London Tower mint , but was produced ( sometimes in some quantity ) at various provincial mints . The denomination is identified by the numeral III appearing behind the king 's head .   Threepences reintroduced   By far the most common Charles I threepences were produced at the Aberystwyth mint between 1638 and 1642 . They feature a left-facing crowned bust of the king with plumes in front of his face and the numeral III behind him , with the legend ( or a combination of M ( A ) B F ( R ) ET H ( I ) ( B ) depending on the engraver ) , with the reverse showing the royal arms on a large oval shield with plumes above the shield , and the legend – I reign under the auspices of Christ . Plumes were the identifying symbol of the Aberystwyth mint , but the Bristol and Oxford mints often used dies from the Aberystwyth mint so plumes often appear on their output too . Milled coins were produced at the York mint between 1638 and 1649 , which look similar to the Aberystwyth product but without the plumes – the obverse features a left-facing crowned bust of the king with the numeral III behind him , with the legend"], [178, "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was established on 1 January 1801 under the terms of the Acts of Union 1800 , by which the separate kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland were united . In 1922 , about five-sixths of Ireland seceded to form the Irish Free State . Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom , and the state was consequently renamed the `` United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland '' .   The period began with the newly formed United Kingdom defeating the French Empire in 1814 in the Napoleonic Wars . The British Empire thereby became the foremost world power for the next century . Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century . In Ireland , this was focused along the eastern seaboard and north of the island , leading to deepening of economic and social disparities . A devastating famine , exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century , led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland , and increased calls for Irish land reform and the devolution of executive power . During and after World War I , the rise of Irish nationalism and physical force republicanism eventually culminated in the Irish War of Independence , and in 1922 the partition of Ireland between the newly founded Irish Free State and the northeast , which opted to remain part of the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland . To reflect the change in the state 's boundaries , the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 amended the name of the UK Parliament to the `` Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland '' .   1801 to 1837   Union of Great Britain and Ireland   The Kingdom of Ireland was a settler state ; the monarch was the incumbent monarch of England and later of Great Britain . The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland headed the government on behalf of the monarch . He was assisted by the Chief Secretary of Ireland . Both were responsible to the government in London rather than to the Parliament of Ireland . Before the Constitution of 1782 , the Irish parliament was also severely fettered , and decisions in Irish courts could be overturned on appeal to the British House of Lords in London .   Ireland gained a degree of independence in the 1780s thanks to Henry Grattan . During this time the effects of the Penal Laws on the majority Roman Catholic population ( and the dissenter minority ) were reduced , and some property-owning Catholics were granted the franchise in 1794 ; however , they were still excluded from becoming members of the Irish House of Commons . This brief period of limited independence came to an end following the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , which occurred during the British war with revolutionary France . The British government 's fear of an independent Ireland siding against them with the French resulted in the decision to unite the two countries . This was brought about by legislation in the parliaments of both kingdoms and came into effect on 1 January 1801 . The Irish had been led to believe by the British that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated for with Catholic Emancipation , i.e . by the removal of civil disabilities placed upon Roman Catholics in both Great Britain and Ireland . However , King George III was bitterly opposed to any such Emancipation and succeeded in defeating his government 's attempts to introduce it .   Napoleonic Wars   During the War of the Second Coalition ( 1799–1801 ) , Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch overseas possessions , the Netherlands having become a satellite state of France in 1796 , but tropical diseases claimed the lives of over 40,000 troops . When the Treaty of Amiens ended the war , Britain agreed to return most of the territories it had seized . The peace settlement was in effect only a ceasefire , and Napoleon continued to provoke the British by attempting a trade embargo on the country and by occupying the city of Hanover , capital of the Electorate , a German-speaking duchy which was in a personal union with the United Kingdom . In May 1803 , war was declared again . Napoleon 's plans to invade Britain failed , chiefly due to the inferiority of his navy , and in 1805 Lord Nelson 's Royal Navy fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at Trafalgar , which was the last significant naval action of the Napoleonic Wars .   In 1806 , Napoleon issued the series of"], [179, "Venice ( ; ) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region . It is situated across a group of 117 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by bridges . These are located in the marshy Venetian Lagoon which stretches along the shoreline , between the mouths of the Po and the Piave Rivers . Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings , their architecture , and artwork . The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site .   In 2009 , 270,098 people resided in Venice 's comune ( the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia ; of whom around 60,000 live in the historic city of Venice ( Centro storico ) ; 176,000 in Terraferma ( the mainland ) , mostly in the large frazioni ( roughly equivalent to `` parishes '' or `` wards '' in other countries ) of Mestre and Marghera ; and 31,000 on other islands in the lagoon ) . Together with Padua and Treviso , the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area ( PATREVE ) , with a total population of 2,600,000 . PATREVE is only a statistical metropolitan area without any degree of autonomy .   The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC . The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice . Venice has been known as the `` La Dominante '' , `` Serenissima '' , `` Queen of the Adriatic '' , `` City of Water '' , `` City of Masks '' , `` City of Bridges '' , `` The Floating City '' , and `` City of Canals '' .   The Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance , and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto , as well as a very important center of commerce ( especially silk , grain , and spice ) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century . This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history . It is also known for its several important artistic movements , especially the Renaissance period . After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna , the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire , until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 , following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence . Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music , and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi .   Etymology   The name of the city , deriving from Latin forms Venetia and Venetiae , is most likely taken from `` Venetia et Histria '' , the Roman name of Regio X of Roman Italy , but applied to the coastal part of the region that remained under Roman Empire outside of Gothic , Lombard , and Frankish control . The name Venetia , however , derives from the Roman name for the people known as the Veneti , and called by the Greeks Eneti ( Ἐνετοί ) . The meaning of the word is uncertain , although there are other Indo-European tribes with similar-sounding names , such as the Celtic Veneti , Baltic Veneti , and the Slavic Wends . Linguists suggest that the name is based on an Indo-European root * wen ( `` love '' ) , so that * wenetoi would mean `` beloved '' , `` lovable '' , or `` friendly '' . A connection with the Latin word venetus , meaning the color 'sea-blue ' , is also possible .  Supposed connections of Venetia with the Latin verb venire ( to come ) , such as Marin Sanudo 's veni etiam ( `` Yet , I have come ! `` ) , the supposed cry of the first refugees to the Venetian lagoon from the mainland , or even with venia ( `` forgiveness '' ) are fanciful . The alternative obsolete form is Vinegia ; ( Venetian : Venèxia ; ; ) .   History   Origins   Although no surviving historical records deal directly with the founding of Venice , tradition and the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original population of Venice consisted of refugees from Roman cities near Venice such as Padua , Aquileia , Treviso , Altino and Concordia ( modern Portogruaro ) and from the undefended countryside , who were fleeing successive waves"], [180, "The Chakri Dynasty ( ; , , [ http : //www.forvo.com/word/ราชวงศ์จักรี/ # th Pronunciation ] ) is the current ruling royal house of the Kingdom of Thailand , while the Head of the house is the King of Thailand . The dynasty has ruled Thailand since the founding of the Rattanakosin Era and the city of Bangkok in 1782 following the end of King Taksin of Thonburi 's reign , when the capital of Siam shifted to Bangkok . The royal house was founded by King Rama I , an Ayutthayan military leader of Sino-Mon descent .   Prior to the founding of the dynasty , King Rama I held for years the title Chakri , the title of the civil chancellor ( สมุหนายก ) . In founding the dynasty , King Rama I himself chose `` Chakri '' as the name for the dynasty . The emblem of the dynasty is composed of the discus ( Chakra ) and the trident ( Trisula ) , the celestial weapons of god Vishnu and Shiva , whom the Thai sovereign is seen as an incarnation .   The current head of the house has been King Bhumibol Adulyadej since 1946 , while his heir apparent is Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn . The house 's current dynastic seat is the Grand Palace in Bangkok .   Royal Family of Thailand   The present royal family of Thailand is descended from Prince Mahidol Adulyadej of Songkla ( 1891–1929 ) and Srinagarindra ( later Princess Mother ) ( 1900–95 ) forming the House of Mahidol ( ราชสกุลมหิดล ) ( a cadet branch of the dynasty ) . The Prince was a son of King Chulalongkorn and his wife Queen Savang Vadhana . The Prince was also the half-brother of both King Vajiravudh and King Prajadhipok .

He is often called England 's national poet , and the `` Bard of Avon '' . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 38 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright .   Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna , and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 , at age 49 , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive , which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , sexuality , and religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others .   Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613 . His early plays were primarily comedies and histories , and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres . He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608 , including Hamlet , Othello , King Lear , and Macbeth , considered some of the finest works in the English language . In his last phase , he wrote tragicomedies , also known as romances , and collaborated with other playwrights .   Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime . In 1623 , however , John Heminges and Henry Condell , two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare , published a more definitive text known as the First Folio , a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare 's . It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson , in which Shakespeare is hailed , presciently , as `` not of an age , but for all time '' .The Norton Anthology of English Literature : Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century , Volume B , 2012 , pg . 1168   In the 20th and 21st centuries , his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance . His plays remain highly popular , and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world .   Life   Early life   William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare , an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield , and Mary Arden , the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer . He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564 . His actual date of birth remains unknown , but is traditionally observed on 23 April , Saint George 's Day . This date , which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar 's mistake , has proved appealing to biographers , because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 . He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son .   Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered in 1553 , about a quarter-mile ( 400 m ) from his home . Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era , but grammar school curricula were largely similar : the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors .   At the age of 18 , Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway . The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582 . The next day , two of Hathaway 's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage . The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste , since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of"], [182, "Harold Edward Holt , ( ; 5 August 1908 - 17 December 1967 ) , was an Australian politician and the 17th Prime Minister of Australia . He was born in Stanmore , New South Wales and won a scholarship to study law at the University of Melbourne . Holt went into business as a solicitor , during which time he joined the United Australia Party ( UAP ) . In 1935 , aged just 27 , he was elected for Fawkner . Holt spent 32 years in Parliament , including many years as a senior Cabinet Minister , but was Prime Minister for only 22 months before he disappeared in December 1967 while swimming at Cheviot Beach near Portsea , Victoria , and was presumed drowned .   As Minister for Immigration ( 1949–1956 ) , Holt was responsible for the relaxation of the White Australia policy and as Treasurer under Menzies , he initiated major fiscal reforms including the establishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia , and launched and guided the process to convert Australia to decimal currency . As Prime Minister , he oversaw landmark changes including the decision not to devalue the Australian dollar in line with the British pound , and the 1967 constitutional referendum in which an overwhelming majority of Australians voted in favour of giving the Commonwealth power to legislate specifically for indigenous Australians . He controversially expanded Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War , with the slogan `` All the way with LBJ '' .   Early life   Born in Stanmore , New South Wales on 5 August 1908 , Holt was the elder son of Thomas and Olive ( née Williams ) . He and his brother Cliff ( Clifford Thomas Holt , born 1910 ) , spent their early life in Sydney , attending three different schools . In 1918 , Thomas Holt divorced Olive and went to work with the Hugh D. McIntosh , manager of the Tivoli theatre circuit . He later became the Tivoli-J C Williamson representative in London and New York . Meanwhile , he enrolled his sons as boarders at Wesley College in Melbourne .   In 1924 , when Holt was sixteen , his mother died and he did not attend her funeral . A formative event was his singing performance at his school 's annual Speech Night in December 1926 . None of his family were present , and he never forgot the loneliness he felt that night .   Holt won a scholarship to Queen 's College at the University of Melbourne and began his law degree in 1927 . He excelled in many areas of university life – he won College 'Blues ' for cricket and Australian rules football , as well as the College Oratory and Essay Prize . A member of the Melbourne Inter-University Debating team and the United Australia Organization ' A ' Grade debating team , he was president of both the Sports and Social Club and the Law Students ' Society .   Holt graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1930 . He was admitted to the Victorian Bar in November 1932 and served his articles with the Melbourne firm of Fink , Best & Miller , but the Great Depression meant that he was unable to find work as a barrister . His father , based in London at the time , wanted him to further his studies in England , but the worsening economy also made this impossible . Instead , in 1933 , Holt went into sole practice as a solicitor . He later entered into a partnership , which became the firm of Holt , Graham & Newman , which Holt remained with until 1963 .   While at university , Holt had met Zara Kate Dickins . In 1934 they were contemplating marriage , but , after a quarrel , they split up . Zara travelled overseas , meeting Captain James Fell , a British Army officer stationed in India , whom she married in March 1935 . Her first son Nicholas was born in 1937 , followed by twin boys Sam and Andrew , born in 1939 . Author Tom Frame has suggested that Holt was the father of the twins . Zara and Fell subsequently divorced , and she married Holt in 1946 . Although they remained married until Holt 's death in 1967 , Zara later commented that Holt had had a number of extramarital affairs .   Meanwhile , Thomas Holt married Lola Thring , the daughter of his business partner F. W. Thring , in 1936 . He died in 1945 .

Seventy-seven were published serially in The Independent Journal and The New York Packet between October 1787 and August 1788 . A compilation of these and eight others , called The Federalist ; or , The New Constitution , was published in two volumes in 1788 by J. and A. McLean . The collection 's original title was The Federalist ; the title The Federalist Papers did not emerge until the 20th century .   Though the authors of The Federalist Papers foremost wished to influence the vote in favor of ratifying the Constitution , in Federalist No . 1 they explicitly set that debate in broader political terms :  It has been frequently remarked , that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country , by their conduct and example , to decide the important question , whether societies of men are really capable or not , of establishing good government from reflection and choice , or whether they are forever destined to depend , for their political constitutions , on accident and force .   Highlights abound in the essays of The Federalist . Federalist No . 10 , in which Madison discusses the means of preventing rule by majority faction and advocates a large , commercial republic , is generally regarded as the most important of the 85 articles from a philosophical perspective ; it is complemented by Federalist No . 14 , in which Madison takes the measure of the United States , declares it appropriate for an extended republic , and concludes with a memorable defense of the constitutional and political creativity of the Federal Convention . In Federalist No . 84 , Hamilton makes the case that there is no need to amend the Constitution by adding a Bill of Rights , insisting that the various provisions in the proposed Constitution protecting liberty amount to a `` bill of rights '' . Federalist No . 78 , also written by Hamilton , lays the groundwork for the doctrine of judicial review by federal courts of federal legislation or executive acts . Federalist No . 70 presents Hamilton 's case for a one-man chief executive . In Federalist No . 39 , Madison presents the clearest exposition of what has come to be called `` Federalism '' . In Federalist No . 51 , Madison distills arguments for checks and balances in an essay often quoted for its justification of government as `` the greatest of all reflections on human nature . ''   According to historian Richard B. Morris , they are an `` incomparable exposition of the Constitution , a classic in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any later American writer . ''   History   Origins   The Federal Convention sent the proposed Constitution to the Confederation Congress , which in turn submitted it to the states for ratification at the end of September 1787 . On September 27 , 1787 , `` Cato '' first appeared in the New York press criticising the proposition ; `` Brutus '' followed on October 18 , 1787 . These and other articles and public letters critical of the new Constitution would eventually become known as the `` Anti-Federalist Papers '' . In response , Hamilton decided to launch a measured defense and extensive explanation of the proposed Constitution to the people of the state of New York . He wrote in Federalist No . 1 that the series would `` endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance , that may seem to have any claim to your attention . ''   Hamilton recruited collaborators for the project . He enlisted John Jay , who after four strong essays ( Federalist Nos . 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) , fell ill and contributed only one more essay , Federalist No . 64 , to the series . He also distilled his case into a pamphlet in the spring of 1788 , [ http : //www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/exhibitions/constitution/address/address.html An Address to the People of the State of New-York ] ; Hamilton cited it approvingly in Federalist No . 85 . James Madison , present in New York as a Virginia delegate to the Confederation Congress , was recruited by Hamilton and Jay , and became Hamilton 's major collaborator . Gouverneur Morris and William Duer were also apparently considered ; Morris turned down"], [184, "Madeira Airport ( ) , informally Funchal Airport ( ) , is an international airport in the municipality/civil parish of Santa Cruz , in the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira . The airport is located east-northeast of the regional capital Funchal after which it is sometimes informally named . On 2016 , it was announced that the airport will be renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo Airport ( ) in honour of Madeira native football player Cristiano Ronaldo .   The airport was once infamous for its short runway which , surrounded by high mountains and the ocean , made it a tricky landing for even the most experienced of pilots . Its innovative solution allowed Funchal to receive the Outstanding Structure Award in 2004 by the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering , which aims at recognizing the most remarkable , innovative , creative or otherwise stimulating structure completed within the last few years . Nevertheless , it is still considered one of the most peculiarly perilous airports in the world .   History   Madeira Airport was officially opened on 18 July 1964 , with two 1600 m runways . The first flight ever to land was a TAP Air Portugal Lockheed Constellation with 80 passengers on board .   In 1972 , the popularity of visiting the island of Madeira increased , so the runway had to be extended to allow modern and larger aircraft to land . Considered the Kai Tak of Europe because of its singular approach to runway 05 , the decision was made to extend the existing runway , instead of building a new one . In the meantime , a brand new terminal was built at the airport in 1973 , handling 500,000 passengers .   Between 1982 and 1986 , Madeira 's runway was successfully extended by 200 m to a total of 1800 m , and also four gates were opened . The original runway was only 1600 m long , but was extended by 200 m 8 years after the TAP Portugal Flight 425 crash of 1977 .   In 2000 , the runway was again extended this time to 2781 m almost doubling the size of the original runway . As landfill was not a realistic option , the extension was built on a platform , partly over the ocean , supported by 180 columns , each about 70 m tall . The extension of Madeira Airport was conducted by the Brazilian construction company Andrade Gutierrez , and is recognized worldwide as one of the most difficult to achieve due to the type of terrain and orography .   The new runway and terminal were inaugurated on 6 October 2002 , and to mark the occasion , an Air-Atlantic Iceland Boeing 747-267B , registration TF-ABA , landed at the airport . Although this was a rare event , some TAP Portugal flights make scheduled stops at Madeira with wide bodied A330-200 aircraft on the Lisbon-Caracas-Lisbon route .   In 2004 , Dr. Manabu Ito , President of the International Association of Bridge and Structural Engineering ( IABSE ) , presented the IABSE Outstanding Structure Award in Shanghai : the enlargement of the new runway at Funchal Airport won the 2004 Outstanding Structure Award ( considered the Oscars of worldwide structural engineering ) by the IABSE .   The History Channel program Most Extreme Airports ranked it as the 9th most dangerous airport in the world , and the third most dangerous in Europe after Gibraltar International Airport and Courchevel Altiport .   On 23 July 2016 , it was announced that the airport will be renamed after famous footballer , Cristiano Ronaldo .   Terminal   The airport has a single terminal which opened in 1973 . The terminal has 40 check-in desks , 16 boarding gates and 7 baggage belts . There are no air-bridges so passengers either walk the short distance to the terminal or are taken by shuttle bus . The terminal itself is mostly underground .   Airlines and destinations   Busiest routes   Accidents and incidents   * On 5 March 1973 , an Aviaco Sud Caravelle 10R ( Registration EC-BID ) crashed into the sea during the landing approach , losing the aircraft and three crew .   * On 19 November 1977 , TAP Portugal Flight TP425 , a Boeing 727-200 ( Registration CS-TBR ) was traveling from Brussels to Madeira via Lisbon . After a go-around , the aircraft attempted to land in poor weather conditions . It landed long on runway 24 ( now runway 23 ) and plunged over a steep bank . It then struck a stone bridge and the right wing"], [185, "Apollo ( Attic , Ionic , and Homeric Greek : , Apollōn ( ) ; Doric : , Apellōn ; Arcadocypriot : , Apeilōn ; Aeolic : , Aploun ; ) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology . The ideal of the kouros ( a beardless , athletic youth ) , Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music , truth and prophecy , healing , the sun and light , plague , poetry , and more . Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto , and has a twin sister , the chaste huntress Artemis . Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu .   As the patron of Delphi ( Pythian Apollo ) , Apollo was an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle . Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo , whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius , yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague . Amongst the god 's custodial charges , Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists , and as the patron defender of herds and flocks . As the leader of the Muses ( Apollon Musegetes ) and director of their choir , Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry . Hermes created the lyre for him , and the instrument became a common attribute of Apollo . Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans .   In Hellenistic times , especially during the 3rd century BCE , as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios , Titan god of the sun , and his sister Artemis similarly equated with Selene , Titan goddess of the moon . In Latin texts , on the other hand , Joseph Fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with Sol among the Augustan poets of the 1st century , not even in the conjurations of Aeneas and Latinus in Aeneid XII ( 161–215 ) . Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE .   Etymology   The name of Apollo itself—though not Paean , a possible name of a precursor god to or epithet of him—is generally considered to be absent from the Linear B ( Mycenean Greek ) texts although it is possible that the name is in fact attested in the lacunose form ] pe-rjo- [ ( Linear B : ] - [ ) on the KN E 842 tablet .   The etymology of the name is uncertain . The spelling ( in Classical Attic ) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era , but the Doric form Apellon ( ) , is more archaic , derived from an earlier . It probably is a cognate to the Doric month Apellaios ( ) , and the offerings apellaia ( ) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai ( ) .  According to some scholars the words are derived from the Doric word apella ( ) , which originally meant `` wall , '' `` fence for animals '' and later `` assembly within the limits of the square . `` The word usually appears in plural : Hesychius : ( apellai ) , ( `` folds '' ) , ( `` assemblies '' ) , ( `` elections '' ) : Nilsson , Vol . I , p. 556 Apella ( ) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta , corresponding to the ecclesia ( ) . R. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form * Apalyun .   Several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors . Thus , the Greeks most often associated Apollo 's name with the Greek verb ( apollymi ) , `` to destroy '' . Plato in Cratylus connects the name with ( apolysis ) , `` redemption '' , with ( apolousis ) , `` purification '' , and with ( [ h ] aploun ) , `` simple '' , in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name , , and finally with ( aeiballon ) , `` ever-shooting '' . Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric ( apella ) , which means `` assembly '' , so that Apollo would be the god of political life , and he also gives the explanation ( sekos ) , `` fold '' , in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds"], [186, "Punchestown Racecourse is located in the parish of Eadestown , between the R410 and R411 regional roads near Naas , County Kildare , in Ireland . It is known as the home of Irish Jumps Racing and plays host to the annual Punchestown Irish National Hunt Festival . The racecourse itself is right handed with an undulating hurdle and steeplechase track . The hurdle course is one mile six furlongs in distance while the chase course is 2 miles . Punchestown Racecourse also has the only cross country banks course in Ireland .   As well as horse racing , Punchestown hosts several music events , including the annual Oxegen festival , while AC/DC , Bon Jovi and Eminem are among the artists to have played sold out concerts on the racecourse . In 1982 U2 played to over 16,000 people supported by Phil Lynott , Rory Gallagher and Simple Minds . this was part of Hot Press fifth Anniversary .   Dick O'Sullivan has been General Manager since 2003 .   Punchestown Festival   The Punchestown Festival is the major horse racing festival of the Irish National Hunt Season and is usually held annually in April . The Punchestown Festival is held over five days , between Tuesday and Saturday inclusive . It is seen by many as the Irish version of the Cheltenham Festival and is run in a very similar format .   The major races at the Festival are the Champion Chase , Ryanair Novice Chase , Champion Hurdle , World Series Hurdle , Herald Champion Novice Hurdle , Tattersalls Ireland Champion Novice Hurdle , Growise Champion Novice Chase , Champion Four Year Old Hurdle , Champion INH Flat Race and the Punchestown Gold Cup .

It is also called Japanese horseradish , although horseradish is a different plant ( which is generally used as a substitute for wasabi , due to the scarcity of the wasabi plant ) . Its stem is used as a condiment and has an extremely strong pungency more akin to hot mustard than the capsaicin in a chili pepper , producing vapours that stimulate the nasal passages more than the tongue . The plant grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan . The two main cultivars in the marketplace are E. japonicum 'Daruma ' and 'Mazuma ' , but there are many others .  The origin of wasabi cuisine has been clarified from the oldest historical records ; it takes its rise in Nara prefecture .   Uses   Wasabi is generally sold either as a stem , which must be very finely grated before use , as dried powder in large quantities , or as a ready-to-use paste in tubes similar to travel toothpaste tubes . Because it grows mostly submerged , it is a common misconception to refer to the part used for wasabi as a root or sometimes even a rhizome : it is in fact the stem of the plant , with the characteristic leaf scar where old leaves fell off or were collected .   In some high-end restaurants , the paste is prepared when the customer orders , and is made using a grater to grate the stem ; once the paste is prepared , it loses flavour in 15 minutes if left uncovered . In sushi preparation , sushi chefs usually put the wasabi between the fish and the rice because covering wasabi until served preserves its flavor .   Fresh wasabi leaves can be eaten , having the spicy flavor of wasabi stems .   Legumes ( peanuts , soybeans , or peas ) may be roasted or fried , then coated with wasabi powder mixed with sugar , salt , or oil and eaten as a crunchy snack .   Surrogates   Wasabi is difficult to cultivate , and that makes it quite expensive . Outside Japan , it is rare to find real wasabi plants . Due to its high cost , a common substitute is a mixture of horseradish , mustard , starch and green food coloring or spinach powder . Often packages are labeled as wasabi while the ingredients do not actually include wasabi plant . Wasabi and horseradish are similar in taste and pungency due to similar isothiocyanate levels . The primary difference between the two is color with Wasabi being naturally green . In Japan , horseradish is referred to as . In the United States , true wasabi is generally found only at specialty grocers and high-end restaurants .   Chemistry   The chemical in wasabi that provides for its initial pungency is the volatile allyl isothiocyanate , which is produced by hydrolysis of natural thioglucosides ( conjugates of the sugar glucose , and sulfur-containing organic compounds ) ; the hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by myrosinase and occurs when the enzyme is released on cell rupture caused by maceration – e.g. , grating – of the plant . The same compound is responsible for the pungency of horseradish and mustard .   The unique flavor of wasabi is a result of complex chemical mixtures from the broken cells of the plant , including those resulting from the hydrolysis of thioglucosides into glucose and methylthioalkyl isothiocyanates :   * 6-methylthiohexyl isothiocyanate  * 7-methylthioheptyl isothiocyanate  * 8-methylthiooctyl isothiocyanate   Research has shown that such isothiocyanates inhibit microbe growth , perhaps with implications for preserving food against spoilage and suppressing oral bacterial growth .   Because the burning sensations of wasabi are not oil-based , they are short-lived compared to the effects of chili peppers , and are washed away with more food or liquid . The sensation is felt primarily in the nasal passage and can be quite painful depending on the amount consumed . Inhaling or sniffing wasabi vapor has an effect like smelling salts , a property exploited by researchers attempting to create a smoke alarm for the deaf . One deaf subject participating in a test of the prototype awoke within 10 seconds of wasabi vapor sprayed into his sleeping chamber . The 2011 Ig Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the researchers for determining the ideal density of airborne wasabi to wake people in the event of an emergency .

He is considered by many as the creator of the modern skyscraper , was an influential architect and critic of the Chicago School , was a mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright , and an inspiration to the Chicago group of architects who have come to be known as the Prairie School . Along with Henry Hobson Richardson and Frank Lloyd Wright , Sullivan is one of `` the recognized trinity of American architecture '' . `` Form follows function '' is attributed to him although he credited the origin of the concept to an ancient Roman architect . In 1944 , he was the second architect in history to posthumously receive the AIA Gold Medal .   Early life and career   Louis Henry Sullivan was born to a Swiss-born mother , Andrienne List , and an Irish-born father , Patrick Sullivan , both of whom had immigrated to the United States in the late 1840s . Learning that he could both be graduated from high school a year early and pass up the first two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by passing a series of examinations . Entering MIT at the age of sixteen , he studied architecture there briefly . After one year of study , he moved to Philadelphia and took a job with architect Frank Furness .   The Depression of 1873 dried up much of Furness 's work , and he was forced to let Sullivan go . At that point Sullivan moved on to Chicago in 1873 to take part in the building boom following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 . He worked for William LeBaron Jenney , the architect often credited with erecting the first steel-frame building . After less than a year with Jenney , Sullivan moved to Paris and studied at the École des Beaux-Arts for a year . He returned to Chicago and began work for the firm of Joseph S. Johnston & John Edelman as a draftsman . Johnston & Edleman were commissioned for the design of the Moody Tabernacle , with the interior decorative `` fresco secco '' stencils ( stencil technique applied on dry plaster ) designed by Sullivan . [ http : //www.prairiestyles.com/lsullivan.htm Louis Sullivan ] at www.prairiestyles.com In 1879 Dankmar Adler hired Sullivan . A year later , Sullivan became a partner in the firm . This marked the beginning of Sullivan 's most productive years .   Adler and Sullivan initially achieved fame as theater architects . While most of their theaters were in Chicago , their fame won commissions as far west as Pueblo , Colorado , and Seattle , Washington ( unbuilt ) . The culminating project of this phase of the firm 's history was the 1889 Auditorium Building ( 1886–90 , opened in stages ) in Chicago , an extraordinary mixed-use building that included not only a 4,200-seat theater , but also a hotel and an office building with a 17-story tower with commercial storefronts at the ground level of the building , fronting Congress and Wabash Avenues . After 1889 the firm became known for their office buildings , particularly the 1891 Wainwright Building in St. Louis and the Schiller ( later Garrick ) Building and theater ( 1890 ) in Chicago . Other buildings often noted include the Chicago Stock Exchange Building ( 1894 ) , the Guaranty Building ( also known as the Prudential Building ) of 1895–96 in Buffalo , New York , and the 1899–1904 Carson Pirie Scott Department Store by Sullivan on State Street in Chicago .   Sullivan and the steel high-rise   Prior to the late-nineteenth century , the weight of a multistory building had to be supported principally by the strength of its walls . The taller the building , the more strain this placed on the lower sections of the building ; since there were clear engineering limits to the weight such `` load-bearing '' walls could sustain , large designs meant massively thick walls on the ground floors , and definite limits on the building 's height .   The development of cheap , versatile steel in the second half of the nineteenth century changed those rules . America was in the midst of rapid social and economic growth that made for great opportunities in architectural design . A much more urbanized society was forming and the society called out for new , larger buildings . The mass production of steel was the main driving force behind the ability to build skyscrapers during"], [189, "West Africa , also called Western Africa and the West of Africa , is the westernmost subcontinent of Africa . West Africa has been defined as including the 18 countries Benin , Burkina Faso , the island of Cape Verde , Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , the island of Saint Helena , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Sao Tome and Principe and Togo .   History   The history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods : first , its prehistory , in which the first human settlers arrived , developed agriculture , and made contact with peoples to the north ; the second , the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-African , and extra-African trade , and developed centralized states ; third , major polities flourished , which would undergo an extensive history of contact with non-Africans ; fourth , the colonial period , in which Great Britain and France controlled nearly the whole of the region ; and fifth , the post-independence era , in which the current nations were formed .   Prehistory   Early human settlers from northern Holocene societies arrived in West Africa around 12,000 B.C . Sedentary farming began in , or around the fifth millennium B.C , as well as the domestication of cattle . By 1500 B.C , ironworking technology allowed an expansion of agricultural productivity , and the first city-states later formed . Northern tribes developed walled settlements and non-walled settlements that numbered at 400 . In the forest region , Iron Age cultures began to flourish , and an inter-region trade began to appear . The desertification of the Sahara and the climatic change of the coast cause trade with upper Mediterranean peoples to be seen .   The domestication of the camel allowed the development of a trans-Saharan trade with cultures across the Sahara , including Carthage and the Berbers ; major exports included gold , cotton cloth , metal ornaments and leather goods , which were then exchanged for salt , horses , textiles , and other such materials . Local leather , cloth , and gold also contributed to the abundance of prosperity for many of the following empires .   Empires   The development of the region 's economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form , beginning with the Nok culture that began in 1000 B.C . and the Ghana Empire that first flourished between the 1st and 3rd centuries , which later gave way to the Mali Empire . In current-day Mauritania , there exist archaeological sites in the towns of Tichit and Oualata that were initially constructed around 2000 B.C. , and were found to have originated from the Soninke branch of the Mandé peoples . Also , based on the archaeology of city of Kumbi Saleh in modern-day Mauritania , the Mali empire came to dominate much of the region until its defeat by Almoravid invaders in 1052 .   The Sosso Empire sought to fill the void , but was defeated ( c. 1240 ) by the Mandinka forces of Sundiata Keita , founder of the new Mali Empire . The Mali Empire continued to flourish for several centuries , most particularly under Sundiata 's grandnephew Musa I , before a succession of weak rulers led to its collapse under Mossi , Tuareg and Songhai invaders . In the 15th century , the Songhai would form a new dominant state based on Gao , in the Songhai Empire , under the leadership of Sonni Ali and Askia Mohammed .   Meanwhile , south of the Sudan , strong city states arose in Igboland , such as the 10th-century Kingdom of Nri , which helped birth the arts and customs of the Igbo people , Bono in the 12th century , which eventually culminated in the formation the all-powerful Akan Empire of Ashanti , while Ife and Benin City rose to prominence around the 14th century . Further east , Oyo arose as the dominant Yoruba state and the Aro Confederacy as a dominant Igbo state in modern-day Nigeria .   Slavery and European contact   Portuguese traders began establishing settlements along the coast in 1445 , followed by the French , English Spanish Danish and Dutch ; the African slave trade began not long after , which over the following centuries would debilitate the region 's economy and population . The slave trade also encouraged the formation of states such as the Asante Empire , Bambara Empire and Dahomey , whose economic activities include but not limited to exchanging slaves for European firearms .

An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key ."]], [[9, 'how many copa de america winners medals did pele and maradona win between them?', " The tournament is named in honor of the Libertadores ( Spanish and Portuguese for liberators ) , the main leaders of the South American wars of independence , so a literal translation of its name into English would be `` Liberators of America Cup '' .

Precession results in Western astrology 's zodiacal divisions not corresponding in the current era to the constellations that carry similar names , while Jyotiṣa measurements still correspond with the background constellations . In Chinese astrology , by contrast , the emphasis is on time , with the zodiac operating on cycles of years , months , and hours of the day . Specifically , the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction .   By the 4th century BC , Babylonians ' astronomy and their system of celestial omens were influencing the Greek culture and , by the late 2nd century BC , Egyptian astrology was also mixing in .   The following table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude , with the Latin names ( still widely used ) and the English translation ( gloss ) . The longitude intervals , being a mathematical division , are closed for the first endpoint ( a ) and open for the second ( b ) — for instance , 30° of longitude is the first point of Taurus , not part of Aries ."]], [[126, "which 20th century philosopher wrote 'being and nothingness' and 'critique of dialectic reason'?", " The term was popularized by Plato 's Socratic dialogues but the act itself has been central to European and Indian philosophy since ancient history .
