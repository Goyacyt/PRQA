The Sixth Doctor appeared in three seasons .

The Sixth Doctor 's era was marked by the decision of the BBC controller Michael Grade to put the series on an 18-month `` hiatus '' between seasons 22 and 23 , with only one new Doctor Who story , Slipback , made on radio during the hiatus , broadcast as 6 parts ( at 10 minutes each ) on BBC Radio 4 from 25 July to 8 August 1985 , as part of a children 's magazine show called Pirate Radio Four . Colin Baker had been signed up for four years , as the previous actor Peter Davison had left after only three years .   Prior to its postponement , season 23 was well advanced with episodes already drafted and in at least one case distributed to cast and production . Alongside `` The Nightmare Fair '' , The Ultimate Evil '' , `` Mission to Magnus '' , `` Yellow Fever and How to Cure It '' , the remaining stories were still under development in a 25-minute episode format after the season was postponed . These were all dropped with the reconception of the season in mid 1985 in favour of a 14 episode story arc called The Trial of a Time Lord . The Sixth Doctor also appeared in the special Dimensions in Time .

Realising what he had nearly done , he initially considered going into a hermitlike existence on the planet Titan 3 , only to be caught up in events on the planet Jocanda , after which he resumed his travels ( The Twin Dilemma ) . He encountered many old foes including the Master , Daleks , Cybermen and Sontarans , and even shared an adventure with his own second incarnation in The Two Doctors .

Later , the Doctor and Peri landed on the devastated planet Ravolox , which they discovered was actually Earth , moved across space with devastating consequences . Before they could discover the reason for this disaster , the TARDIS landed on Thoros Beta . What actually happened here is unclear , but initial accounts suggest that Peri was killed after being cruelly used as a test subject in brain transplant experiments and the Doctor was pulled out of time to a Time Lord space station where he was put on trial for the second time by his own race , the Time Lords .

During the Napoleonic Wars , a British military expedition landed in the Cape Colony and defeated the defending Dutch forces at the Battle of Blaauwberg ( 1806 ) . After the war , the British formally acquired the colony ( 1814 ) , and encouraged immigration by British settlers who were largely at odds with the Dutch settlers . Many Boers who were dissatisfied with aspects of British administration , in particular with Britain 's abolition of slavery on 1 December 1834 , elected to migrate away from British rule in what became known as the Great Trek .   The Trekkers initially followed the eastern coast towards Natal and then , after Britain annexed the Natal in 1843 , journeyed northwards towards the interior . There they established two independent Boer republics : the South African Republic ( 1852 ; also known as the Transvaal Republic ) and the Orange Free State ( 1854 ) . The British recognised the two Boer republics in 1852 and 1854 , but attempted British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 led to the First Boer War in 1880\u201381 .

Music Festival is an annual music festival held at the Gorge Amphitheatre in George , Washington . In recent years , it has taken place on the Memorial Day weekend , running for three to four days . In 2014 , Adam Zacks decided to expand the festival to two weekends due to the high demand for tickets in 2013 . Rather than expanding to two four-day weekends , the festival instead only expanded to two- to three-day weekends .   About the Festival   Sasquatch ! typically features a range of musical genres , with the emphasis being on indie rock bands and singer-songwriters , but also including alternative rock , hip hop , EDM , and comedy acts . As of 2012 the festival features five stages : Sasquatch ! Main Stage , Bigfoot Stage , Banana Shack ( a tent that features primarily comedy acts and electronic music- now known as El Chupacabra ) , Yeti Stage , and Uranus Stage ( the smallest of stages , that generally changes names every year ) .   Most attendees of the festival camp in designated campsite fields nearby , as the venue is relatively remote and there are no large urban areas nearby .   Sasquatch ! was voted as one of the 'Top 10 Summer Music Festivals in the US '' by ConcertBoom .   History   The Sasquatch ! Music Festival was founded in 2002 by Pacific Northwest-based concert promoter Adam Zacks , then at House of Blues . Prior to the inception of the festival , Zacks booked and managed shows at the Roseland Theater in Portland , Oregon . After moving to Seattle , Washington to be closer to friends and family , Zacks began considering the creation of a music festival in the Pacific Northwest . In an interview with Seattle Weekly in September 2007 , Zacks described the birth of Sasquatch ! :   Sasquatch was an idea born on a hunch that there was untapped demand for a certain kind of festival that catered to the eclectic tastes of music enthusiasts . It started in 2002 , which was shortly after a number of the touring festivals ( Lollapalooza , Lilith , Horde ) had petered out and the beginning of the wave of regional festivals that started with Coachella and now is a dominant force on the music landscape , with Bonnaroo , Austin City Limits , etc .   On March 21 , 2014 the Independence Day Weekend of Sasquatch was cancelled . Jeff Trisler , President of Live Nation , released the following statement upon the announcement : `` The Sasquatch ! community has spoken . They continue to support the traditional Memorial Day Weekend event with great enthusiasm , '' Jeff Trisler , president of Live Nation Seattle , said in a statement . `` Unfortunately , the second weekend was not embraced .

In recent years , it has taken place on the Memorial Day weekend , running for three to four days . Rather than expanding to two four-day weekends , the festival instead only expanded to two- to three-day weekends .   About the Festival   Sasquatch ! As of 2012 the festival features five stages : Sasquatch ! Main Stage , Bigfoot Stage , Banana Shack ( a tent that features primarily comedy acts and electronic music- now known as El Chupacabra ) , Yeti Stage , and Uranus Stage ( the smallest of stages , that generally changes names every year ) .   Most attendees of the festival camp in designated campsite fields nearby , as the venue is relatively remote and there are no large urban areas nearby .   Sasquatch ! was voted as one of the 'Top 10 Summer Music Festivals in the US '' by ConcertBoom .   History   The Sasquatch ! Music Festival was founded in 2002 by Pacific Northwest-based concert promoter Adam Zacks , then at House of Blues . Prior to the inception of the festival , Zacks booked and managed shows at the Roseland Theater in Portland , Oregon . After moving to Seattle , Washington to be closer to friends and family , Zacks began considering the creation of a music festival in the Pacific Northwest . In an interview with Seattle Weekly in September 2007 , Zacks described the birth of Sasquatch ! It started in 2002 , which was shortly after a number of the touring festivals ( Lollapalooza , Lilith , Horde ) had petered out and the beginning of the wave of regional festivals that started with Coachella and now is a dominant force on the music landscape , with Bonnaroo , Austin City Limits , etc .   On March 21 , 2014 the Independence Day Weekend of Sasquatch was cancelled . Jeff Trisler , President of Live Nation , released the following statement upon the announcement : `` The Sasquatch ! community has spoken . They continue to support the traditional Memorial Day Weekend event with great enthusiasm , '' Jeff Trisler , president of Live Nation Seattle , said in a statement . `` Unfortunately , the second weekend was not embraced . We felt it was better to cancel the new event now and give everyone time to make alternative plans for the Fourth of July weekend . Going forward , Sasquatch !

The objective is to score points by knocking down as many pins as possible . Three finger holes are drilled into a traditional bowling ball , and weights vary considerably to make the sport playable for all ages . The pins are arranged in a triangular position by an automated machine . While professional ten-pin bowling tournaments are held in numerous countries , the sport is commonly played as a hobby by millions of people around the world .   In Canada , the United States , United Kingdom and Australia , the game is commonly referred to as just `` Bowling '' . In New England , `` bowling '' is usually referred to as `` ten-pin bowling '' or `` big-ball bowling '' , because of the smaller diameter , lighter weight ball used in the Worcester , Massachusetts-conceived sport of candlepin bowling from 1880 , and the similarly `` small-ball '' sport of duckpin bowling ( conceived in 1895 ) , popular in the Northeast United States , as well as Canada 's own sport of five-pin bowling , all three of which use smaller diameter , lighter weight bowling balls when compared to tenpin bowling , without the necessity for finger holes in them .   Summary   The , 60 ft lane is bordered along its length by semicylindrical channels called `` gutters '' , which are designed to collect errant balls . The overall width of the lane including the channels is . The narrow lane prevents bowling a straight line at the angle required to consistently carry ( knock down ) all ten pins for a strike . Most skillful bowlers will roll a side spinning ( hook shape reaction ) ball to overcome this . A foul line is marked at the end of the lane nearest to the bowler : if any part of a bowler 's body touches the line itself or beyond ( anywhere on the actual lane surface or any adjoining areas including walls and other lanes ) after the ball is delivered , the bowl is a foul and any pins knocked over by that delivery are scored as zero ( 0 ) . The bowler is allowed one shot at a new rack of ten pins if s/he fouled on the first roll of a frame , and if all ten pins are knocked down on this shot , it is scored as a spare . Behind the foul line is an `` approach '' approximately 15 ft long used to gain speed and leverage on the ball before delivering it . 60 ft from the foul line , where the lane terminates , it is joined to a roughly 36 in deep by wide surface of durable and impact-resistant material called the `` pin deck '' , upon which each rack of pins is set .   Play   The bowler is allowed 10 frames in which to knock down pins , with frames one ( 1 ) through nine ( 9 ) being composed of up to two rolls . The tenth frame is composed of up to three rolls : the bonus roll ( s ) following a strike or spare in the tenth ( sometimes referred to as the eleventh and twelfth frames ) are fill ball ( s ) used only to calculate the score of the mark rolled in the tenth . If neither a strike or a spare is achieved in the tenth frame , no bonus roll is awarded .   Bowling has a unique scoring system which keeps track not only of the current pinfall in a frame , but also strikes and spares which allow for the value of subsequent pinfall . Effectively , there are three kinds of marks given in a score ; a strike ( all ten down in the first ball ) , a spare ( all ten down by the second ball ) , and an open ( one or more missed pins still standing after the second ball ) . A strike earns ten points plus the points for the next two balls thrown . ( For example , if a player got a strike then followed with a 7 then 2 , their value for the strike frame would be 10+7+2 , or 19 . ) A spare earns ten points plus the points for the next ball thrown .

In New England , `` bowling '' is usually referred to as `` ten-pin bowling '' or `` big-ball bowling '' , because of the smaller diameter , lighter weight ball used in the Worcester , Massachusetts-conceived sport of candlepin bowling from 1880 , and the similarly `` small-ball '' sport of duckpin bowling ( conceived in 1895 ) , popular in the Northeast United States , as well as Canada 's own sport of five-pin bowling , all three of which use smaller diameter , lighter weight bowling balls when compared to tenpin bowling , without the necessity for finger holes in them . The narrow lane prevents bowling a straight line at the angle required to consistently carry ( knock down ) all ten pins for a strike . Most skillful bowlers will roll a side spinning ( hook shape reaction ) ball to overcome this . A foul line is marked at the end of the lane nearest to the bowler : if any part of a bowler 's body touches the line itself or beyond ( anywhere on the actual lane surface or any adjoining areas including walls and other lanes ) after the ball is delivered , the bowl is a foul and any pins knocked over by that delivery are scored as zero ( 0 ) . The bowler is allowed one shot at a new rack of ten pins if s/he fouled on the first roll of a frame , and if all ten pins are knocked down on this shot , it is scored as a spare . 60 ft from the foul line , where the lane terminates , it is joined to a roughly 36 in deep by wide surface of durable and impact-resistant material called the `` pin deck '' , upon which each rack of pins is set .   Play   The bowler is allowed 10 frames in which to knock down pins , with frames one ( 1 ) through nine ( 9 ) being composed of up to two rolls . The tenth frame is composed of up to three rolls : the bonus roll ( s ) following a strike or spare in the tenth ( sometimes referred to as the eleventh and twelfth frames ) are fill ball ( s ) used only to calculate the score of the mark rolled in the tenth . If neither a strike or a spare is achieved in the tenth frame , no bonus roll is awarded .   Bowling has a unique scoring system which keeps track not only of the current pinfall in a frame , but also strikes and spares which allow for the value of subsequent pinfall . Effectively , there are three kinds of marks given in a score ; a strike ( all ten down in the first ball ) , a spare ( all ten down by the second ball ) , and an open ( one or more missed pins still standing after the second ball ) . ( For example , if a player got a strike then followed with a 7 then 2 , their value for the strike frame would be 10+7+2 , or 19 . ) A spare earns ten points plus the points for the next ball thrown .", "question": "what is the highest possible score in a game of ten pin bowling?", "groundTruth": "$5 million", "answer": "the text does not provide information on what the highest possible score in a game of ten pin bowling is", "modAnswer": "the highest possible score in a game of ten-pin bowling is 300", "delete sentence number": "[' The pins are arranged in a triangular position by an automated machine .', '   Summary   The , 60 ft lane is bordered along its length by semicylindrical channels called `` gutters '' , which are designed to collect errant balls .', ' The overall width of the lane including the channels is .', ' Behind the foul line is an `` approach '' approximately 15 ft long used to gain speed and leverage on the ball before delivering it .', ' A strike earns ten points plus the points for the next two balls thrown .']", "distance value": [[0, 0.7261830568313599], [12, 0.6797546744346619], [15, 0.6738020181655884], [18, 0.6348934769630432], [6, 0.6221250891685486], [4, 0.6049796938896179], [2, 0.5977573394775391], [1, 0.5925394296646118], [19, 0.5925173759460449], [9, 0.5876038074493408], [22, 0.5526831150054932], [20, 0.548613429069519], [10, 0.5200169086456299], [11, 0.5178743600845337], [5, 0.5024259090423584], [16, 0.4784753918647766], [17, 0.3964584469795227], [14, 0.3785576820373535], [21, 0.3527342975139618], [3, 0.3301651179790497], [13, 0.2598109841346741], [7, 0.2506357431411743], [8, 0.23483461141586304]]}]
