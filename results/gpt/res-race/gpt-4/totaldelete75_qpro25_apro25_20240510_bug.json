So, for shy people who feel worried about facing a particular challenge or event, Taylor advises slowly approaching the fearful situation if you start to feel anxious. By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. \"Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted,\" he says. \"If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it.\" What's more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.Shy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. \"Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations,\" Taylor says. \"It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room.\" In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren't shy.

It turned out to be a great success. The film got $1 billion in ticket sales in a very short time. The story in the film happens on an alien planet called Pandora where many strange species live. Among the planet's inhabitants(,),the one that has the most similarities with humans is the Na'vi, and it is the struggle between the Ma'vi and human invaders  that forms the story of the film.As to the factors  leading to the film's success, many think that the entertaining feast  for the eyes and the wonderful story shouldn't be forgotten, but the new language invented especially for the film which provides audiences with a new experience also plays an important part.In order to increase the truthfulness of an alien race , the film's director James Cameron asked an expert in languages from the University of Southern California to invent a language for the Na'vi. Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.According to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na'vi language is that it could be pronounced. \"This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses,\" Professor Frommer told the BBC, \"it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it.\"The language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games. The professor hopes that one day his creation will be as successful as the Klingon alien language from the \"Star Trek\"films. \"There's a translation of Hamlet into Klingon and it has received great popularity among the audiences,\" says Professor Frommer,\"if anything like this happens to the Na'vi language, I'd be very happy.\"", "modContext": "In order to increase the truthfulness of an alien race , the film's director James Cameron asked an expert in languages from the University of Southern California to invent a language for the Na'vi.
