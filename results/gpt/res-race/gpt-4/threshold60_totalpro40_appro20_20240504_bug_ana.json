A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount). Having an extra two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend would soundly benefit any child's life quality."], [1, 'I\'ve often had difficulty remembering names. Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?I easily remembered his surname, "Ricca". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn\'t have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One\'s name is important to every person\'s identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance\'s name is similar to forgetting your wife\'s favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil."Bill, how are you doing?", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers? The sudden realization of what I did made me stop in my tracks. My head dropped when I realized my mistake. There was no way Mrs. Ricca would name one of her sons "Bill". "Billerica" was the name of a town just north of Boston.'], [2, 'Uncle Tom gave little Vicki Black a birthday gift one week before her birthday. He told her not to open it until her birthday. She knew her mother wouldn\'t tolerate any disrespect to the kind man who helped them out after Vicki\'s father passed away. Besides, Vicki didn\'t want to get Uncle Tom angry. But little Vicki didn\'t want to just hold it and guess what was in it. After all, she looked forward to his coming to show her interesting things, like how to turn an old sock into a doll.All the day, Vicki couldn\'t stop thinking about the gift. While her teacher was giving a lecture, Vicki sat still in her seat, drawing paper dolls inside the box. When school was done, she raced home. Walking into the room, again, she shook the present, but she heard nothing. Holding her breath, she opened the box and looked inside. Seconds later, she cried. When Mrs Black saw the box, she said angrily, "Didn\'t I tell you to leave it alone?"Vicki sobbed   and said, "Mommy, you don\'t understand.""Don\'t cry to me. You have missed everything now, just because you couldn\'t wait," Mrs Black accused. "What will Uncle Tom think now?""Uncle Tom gave me nothing," Vicki cried and handed the empty box to her mother. "He played a trick on me."Mrs Black said doubtfully, "Uncle Tom is not like that. You must have dropped it."Vicki kept crying. Only a rapid knock on the door made the house quiet. It was Uncle Tom. He looked at the empty box. "You have already done it? I told you to wait for your birthday.""You didn\'t give me a gift." Fresh tears filled her eyes."I try to give you something. I know your birthday is a special day. I tell myself to give you something valuable to last your whole life. I think hard and get an idea to give you an important lesson. If you open it on birthday, I see you learn. Then I will make a big party to celebrate, Maybe next year you listen, and then you will understand the gift better."Vicki\'s cheeks flushed  .'], [3, '"Is there anything else you need, honey?" my dad asked me as he put three twenty dollar bills in my hand. I was traveling back home from a family visit, and after treating me to breakfast and filling my car with gas, it was obvious that my dad wanted to make sure that I would be okay on the road."No, Dad. You\'ve done so much already. Thank you!" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father\'s eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right. Now that he has enough money, he loves to give whenever he sees a need.But this was not always the case. Divorced from my mother when I was 11, my dad couldn\'t be around his kids as often as he would have liked. Money was also tight; even weekend visits were rare. However, my dad stayed in constant communication with us and made sure he was involved in our lives. Though he couldn\'t always be there in person, I knew he was only a phone call away. I could always make sure of that.Even now, almost 30 years later, I treasure knowing that I can pick up the phone and call Dad, and he\'ll be there for me. I have a wonderful husband, but that hasn\'t changed how Dad sees me. I\'m still his child and he loves to see that my needs are met.I remember a time when I was shopping in a hardware store   with Dad. I mentioned my plans to paint one wall in my house. Well, that\'s all it took for Dad to take action. By the time I got to the checkout  line, all the supplies I picked out were put out of my hands and placed with things he bought.Then there was the time when I took him with me to do some grocery shopping for just a few " items". By the time we were finished, my shopping cart was full of groceries from every shelf in the store! My sister and I joke that if you don\'t want Dad to buy it for you, avoid even mentioning you want something.'], [4, "Today, roller skating is easy and fun. But a long time ago, it wasn't easy at all. Before 1750, the idea of skating didn't exist. That changed because of a man named Joseph Merlin. Merlin's work was making musical instruments. In his spare time he liked to play the violin. Joseph Merlin was a man of ideas and dreams. People called him a dreamer.One day Merlin received an invitation to attend a fancy dress ball. He was very pleased and a little excited. As the day of the party came near, Merlin began to think how to make a grand entrance at the party. He had an idea. He thought he would get a lot of attention if he could skate into the room.Merlin tried different ways to make himself roll. Finally, he decided to put two wheels under each shoe. These were the first roller skates. Merlin was very proud of his invention and dreamed of arriving at the party on wheels while playing the violin.On the night of the party Merlin rolled into the room playing his violin. Everyone was astonished to see him. There was just one problem. Merlin had no way to stop his roller skates. He rolled on and on. Suddenly, he ran into a huge mirror that was hanging on the wall. Down fell the mirror, breaking to pieces. Nobody forgot Merlin's grand entrance for a long time!"], [5, 'At 10:35 a.m. on December 17, 1903, two brothers from Ohio flew the first successful airplane for 12 seconds and 120 feet along a beach in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. With Orville flying first, the brothers took turns as pilot, and they flew three more times that day. On their fourth try, they managed to go 852 feet in 59 seconds ----an amazing feat at the time. The two brothers had invented powered flight. Orville and Wilbur Wright owned a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Although they had not gone to school to learn about airplanes or engineering, they were good mechanics. By repairing bicycles, they had learned how gears and pulleys worked. They also learned to take careful notes about what they saw. Each time they made a new design and tested a machine, they took notes and made drawings. They would study these to figure out what they could do better the next time.Before the Wright brothers flew, they did many things to prepare for this extraordinary achievement. They read everything they could find about air, balloons, and kites. Then they made careful sketches of what they wanted to build. They began by making model kites to learn how air flowed over wings. They made them bigger and bigger until they had a glider -- a kite that is big enough to hold a person, but with no engine. The Wright brothers made three gliders before building their first airplane. Each time they made a glider, they would test it, make careful observations, and then improve their design. When they made a glider that flew well, they added an engine. This step was harder than it sounds, because they had to find an engine that was both light-weight and powerful. The engines that they could buy were either too heavy or too weak, so they asked their friend Charlie Taylor to help them build one. The first engine that Charlie built broke almost immediately, but the second one worked well.   After Orville and Wilbur installed the engine in their plane, they were almost ready. They simply had to wait for the perfect day with just the fight amount of wind. On the morning of December 17, 1903, they had their chance. And the airplane flew into history.'], [7, "Geneva is situated between the Jura Range and the Alps on the western end of Lake Geneva. Capital of Peace is one of its names-- the European headquarters of the United Nations lies here in Palais des Nations. Another worthy name for this city with a humanitarian tradition and international character is the World's Smallest Metropolis. Parks,splendid stores and lively streets in the old part of town and its 2000 -- year history wait to be discovered.The Jet d'Eau together with the Flower Watch are the main attractions every year for the tourists visiting Geneva. The Jet d'Eau has become the symbol of Geneva for a long time. This is a 140 meters high water monument with a rich history. Eight 13,500--watt projectors light the grand column of the fountain in the evening, from early March until the second Sunday of October. The Flower Watch, which was created at the edge of the English Garden in 1955,reminds us about that Geneva is the birthplace of the Swiss clock and watch making, and that this industry has become internationally famous, as well through the quality of the watches as through their beautiful appearance.Sails on Lake Geneva are also enjoyable. The Lake of Geneva, lying among the Alps, is a true inland sea, making possible a wide range of pleasant boat trips, you can relax and watch the beautiful scenes pass by."], [8, "I walked down the hall heading to see my 88-year-old grandma who had been in hospital. Each member of the family was taking turns sitting with her because of her dementia  . As I did I looked very carefully at some of the rooms on this wing of the hospital, and it seemed that almost every bed held an elderly person. Some appeared to be confused, and some just looked lonely. I couldn't help but notice that there was no family there, no one to care them, and no one to reduce the ache of loneliness. My heart broke inside me.They are aging, with withered   skin on their faces and hands, their eyes look tried, and yet no one notices them. Could it be that we are far too busy to slow down and give a moment of our time to anyone that may swerve   us off the course we are traveling on? Are we afraid of those who have come before us to pave the way, afraid that they carry some awful disease that if we get too close we might catch it?Whatever the case may be, one day we will be those same people that we long to avoid. We pay thousands of dollars for staying young, and we may turn up the music to forget the thoughts of getting older. But, try as we might, time and age will catch up with us.We seem to have come to detest   the elderly. While we once held them in high regard and honor, always enjoying their stories of history, we now see them as a pain, always in our way. Isn't it time we wake up?So, next time you see a withered hand extended in need, or peer into the eyes of a lonely aging face, don't run or look away. Remember, it might just be you in that place one day."], [9, 'Memory, they say, is a matter of practice and exercise. If you have the wish and really make a conscious   effort, then you can quite easily improve your ability to remember things. But even if you are successful, there are times when your memory seems to play tricks on you.Sometimes you remember things that really did not happen. One morning last week, for example, I got up and found that I had left the front door unlocked all night, yet I clearly remembered locking it carefully the night before.Memory "tricks" work the other way as well. Once in a while you remember not doing something and then find out that you did. One day last month, for example,I was sitting in a barbershop   waiting for my turn to get a haircut, and suddenly I realized that I had got a haircut two days before at the barbershop across the street from my office.We always seem to find something funny and interesting in incidents  caused by people\'s forgetfulness or absent-mindedness. Stories about absent-minded professors have been told for years. Unfortunately, however, absent-mindedness is not always funny. There are times when "tricks" of our memory can cause us great trouble.'], [11, "Let us take a serious look at what the results might be if such a suggestion were accepted. Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest. The truth is that we had a ball."], [12, 'I lost my sight when I was four years old by falling off a box car in a freight yard in Atlantic City and landing on my head. Now I am thirty two. I can slightly remember the brightness of sunshine and what color red is. It would be wonderful to see again, but a calamity  can do strange things to people. It occurred to me the other day that I might not have come to love life as I do if I hadn\'t been blind. I believe in life now. I am not so sure that I would have believed in it so deeply, otherwise. I don\'t mean that I would prefer to go without my eyes. I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left.Life, I believe, asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality. The more readily a person is able to make these adjustments, the more meaningful his own private world becomes. The adjustment is never easy. I was totally confused and afraid. But I was lucky. My parents and my teachers saw something in me--a potential to live, you might call it--which I didn\'t see, and they made me want to fight it out with blindness.The hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself. That was basic. If I hadn\'t been able to do that, I would have collapsed   and _ for the rest of my life. When I say belief in myself I am not talking about simply the kind of self confidence that helps me down an unfamiliar staircase alone. That is part of it. But I mean something bigger than that: an assurance  that I am, despite imperfections, a real, positive person; that somewhere in the sweeping, intricate  pattern of people there is a special place where I can make myself fit.It took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance. It had to start with the simplest things. Once a man gave me an indoor baseball. I thought he was making fun of me and I was hurt. "I can\'t use this." I said. "Take it with you," he urged me, "and roll it around." The words stuck in my head. "Roll it around! "By rolling the ball I could hear where it went. This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible: playing baseball. At Philadelphia\'s Overbrook School for the Blind I invented a successful variation of baseball. We called it ground ball.All my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them, one at a time. I had to learn my limitations. It was no good to try for something I knew at the start was wildly out of reach because that only invited the bitterness of failure. I would fail sometimes anyway but on the average I made progress.'], [15, 'Today we tell about the expression "down to earth".Down to earth means being open and honest.It is easy to deal with someone who is down to earth.Such people could be important members of society, but they do not consider themselves to be better than others who are less important.They do not let their importance "go to their heads." Someone who lets something go to his head feels he is better than others.He has a "big head."A person who is filled with his own importance and pride is said to have "his nose in the air."Often the person who has a big head and his nose in the air has no reason to feel better than others.Americans use another expression that is similar in some ways to down to earth---"both feet on the ground." Someone with both feet on the ground is a person with a good understanding of reality.She has what is called "common sense." She does not allow her dreams to block her understanding of what is real.The opposite kind of person is one who has his "head in the clouds." Someone with his head in the clouds is a person whose mind is not on what is happening in real life.Such a person may be called a "daydreamen."The person who is down to earth usually has both feet on the ground.But the opposite is not always true.Someone with both feet on the ground may not be as open and easy to deal with as someone who is down to earth.When we have both our feet firmly on the ground,and when we are down to earth,we do not have our noses in the air.We act honestly and openly to others.And our lives are like the ground below up--solid and strong.'], [16, 'What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever? Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it\'s one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.It\'s been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying"It got lost"to"I lost it". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That\'s why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.George Bernard Shaw once said,"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don\'t believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can\'t find them, make them.""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,"said Albert Schweitzer.The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient\'s bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn\'t know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital\'s housekeeping group.The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed."It\'s not my responsibility,"said the nurse,"because it\'s a large puddle  ."The housekeeper didn\'t agree."Well, it\'s not mine,"she said,"the puddle is too small."The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor."Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver\'s seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.'], [18, 'Ways to travelModern life is impossible without travelling. The fastest way to travel is by air. With a modern plane you can travel in one day to places which took a month or more one hundred years ago.Travelling by train is slower than by air, but it has its advantages . You can see the country you are travelling in. Modern trains have comfortable seats and dining cars. They make even the longest journey enjoyable.Some people prefer to travel by sea when it is possible. There are large lines and river boats with which you can visit many other countries and different places. Travelling by sea is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday.Many people like to travel by car. You can make your own timetable. You can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty miles a day, just as you like. You can stop wherever you wish: where there is something interesting to see, at a good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meal, or a hotel to spend the night. That is why travelling by car is popular for pleasure trips, while people usually take a train or a plane when they are travelling on business.'], [19, "Children have their own rules in playing games. They seldom need a judge and rarely trouble to keep scores. They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules. Those rules may be childish, but they make sure that every child has a chance to win."], [21, 'Carrying everything they need on their backs, three friends from England are setting out  to run 39 marathons across Eastern Europe.Tom, Rob and Guy ran the Marathon des Sables last year and were looking for another  challenge.Where do you go from there?" asks Tom.Then someone said, "Run 1,000 miles".And the idea was born.The three friends are running from Odessa in Ukraine to Dubrovnik in Croatia in 30 days,  to raise awareness of child trafficking  and to raise & 50,000 for the charity Love 146. The money will enab4 Love 146 to bui4 a home in the UK to provide specialist aftercare to  victims of child trafficking.

It\'s these traits that tend to affect some shy individuals\' ability to connect," says C. Barr Taylor, a professor of psychology at Stanford University."But while shyness can often be seen as a bad thing, there are ways to use the personality trait to your advantage," Taylor says. Below are some common shy habits and how you can learn to make them benefit you:Shy people usually reflect inwardly   a lot. But according to Taylor,all that thinking may not always be a bad thing and it should be viewed as a way you can think actively as you go into a situation. So, for shy people who feel worried about facing a particular challenge or event, Taylor advises slowly approaching the fearful situation if you start to feel anxious. By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. "Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted," he says. "If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it." What\'s more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.Shy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. "Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations," Taylor says. "It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room." In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren\'t shy. In addition, a shy person has a born drive to absorb a conversation, so they can be great at conversation.'], [23, "The twenty-four horses dash around a racetrack. The thunder of their hooves   rings in the riders' ears, nearly drowning out the cheering of the crowd. After three or four minutes of suspense, one horse crosses the finish line first, winning the Melbourne Cup and earning a place in history.The horses that compete in the Melbourne Cup--one of the world's most famous horseraces--were fated to race. Bred for speed, these horses are the few that were singled out as having potential to become champions.Preparing a racehorse to compete requires a team. A horse's owner manages the team and decides which races to enter. A trainer determines the racehorse's diet and exercise. Regular exercise makes a horse less likely to be injured, but overtraining tires the horse. A groomer   cares for the racehorse and reports any problems he discovers to the trainer. And of course, no horserace could be run without a rider. These riders train for long hours and travel constantly from one race to another. They need to make a strategy, adapt to changing conditions and communicate with their horse to guide it to victory.Australia's most famous horserace, the Melbourne Cup, is 3,200 meters of pure excitement. Each year 300 or 400 horses are nominated  , but only 24 can run. The competitors are chosen based on a number of factors, but winners of certain races qualify automatically.Each racehorse receives a handicap--a certain weight it must carry to give each horse an equal chance of winning--two months before the race. Originally, horses that seemed likely to win were assigned larger handicaps. But the rules have changed, reducing the handicap for previous winners.The first Melbourne Cup in 1861 drew a crowd of 4,000 spectators, and the race's popularity has grown since then. Held on the first Tuesday of November, the cup has become a four-day festival with fine food and entertainment.The Melbourne Cup began during a gold rush as a form of entertainment for the rich. Today it still attracts society's upper class. They come dressed in their finest to enjoy the event in comfort.But anyway it's all about the race--the effort of horses and riders, the suspense and the thrill of victory."], [24, "Here's one very simple but lifechanging advice that I first heard from Brian Tracy.

My partner and I won the Canadian junior pairs championship when I was 14. Later I was thrilled to be picked to skate in the 1994 Olympics in lillehammer, Norway. But then everything came down.    We finished the 12th at the Games. I soon quit double skating and tried to continue in singles. But I wasn\'t good enough; I didn\'t even compete in the next two national championships. I felt like I was a somebody who had become a nobody.    I was 18 and had just graduated from high school, when my mum told me, "You can\'t just depend on skating to make a living. You\'d better find a job." I knew she was right. So I found a job at a restaurant where I waited at tables and did anything else that needed to be done. In fact, I worked so hard that I had never got the chance to have a break. No one cared that I had been an Olympic skater; I was judged only by how hard I worked.    That job taught me so many things. I learned, for example, how to deal with people. As an athlete, this was new to me. One day a man loudly called me over to his table and complained, "This milk is sour. I am not drinking this junk! I want my money back! " It was near the end of my shift   and I wanted to tell him how rude I thought he was. But I had learned that "the customer is always right" and a smile can go a long way. "I\'m really sorry, sir. I\'ll get you a free cup." I said with a smile. When I brought him his coffee, his attitude changed. And he left me a tip!    My first job taught me that it is important to do your best at anything you try. I knew nothing about being a waitress when 1 started my job but by the time I left when 1 decided to return to skating -- I had earned a raise and my boss\'s praise. They meant so much to me.'], [26, 'Bali is an Indonesia island that is rich in indigenous   culture. A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the "now". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be "just like Bali". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called "Hindu Darma". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation   is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and colorful event for the Balinese.'], [28, 'Planted for their fragrance and beauty, roses historically have been the center of much praise and are one of the most universal symbols of love and life. As the phrase goes, sometimes you do have to "stop and smell the roses".Although you may think that this is just a fancy way of saying taking some time to enjoy life, perhaps we have dismissed roses for too long. Seriously, you should pay more attention to those roses. They could greatly improve your life. That is, if you are one of the millions of people in the US who suffer from arthritis diseases.Result from two different arthritis studies have proved that an active ingredient of rose hips has been shown to protect and possibly rebuild joint tissue broken down by arthritis. The latest results, presented at the World Conference in Rome showed that protein GOPO(R) found in rose hips can protect vulnerable cartilage . GOPO(R) has also been shown to improve mood, increase energy and sleep quality of those affected by arthritis. Marked by stiffness, swelling, loss of flexibly and pain, arthritis can significantly stop one from a normal life."We have little doubt that certain rose hip preparations, and GOPO(R) in particular, have had an important role to play in reducing the pain and disability caused by arthritis," said Winther.With the aid of this new research, those affected by joint pain caused by arthritis could choose an alternative treatment than pain killers. "We suspect that more people will be turning to the power of rose-hip for joint pain relief," said Winther.Sorry Shakespeare, but in this case, no other rose could smell as sweet.'], [29, 'The preventive measures for forest fires include some preemptive methods that can help reduce the risks of fires and control their severity and spread,and thus, maintain ecological balance and protect resources.Close monitoring of forest fires caused by natural factors can help prevent their spread to a large extent.To contain forest fires,fire departments usually use water and chemical fire retardants that can be dropped from planes and helicopters.To control the spread of a wildfire.firefighters usually create a control line by removing all fuel from an area so that the fire cannot travel across it.Controlled burns are often employed by government authorities to reduce fuel buildup,and clean up the fallen leaves,and thus,prevent the spread of forest fires to a vast area.Regular controlled burns can also help maintain biodiversity ,as the smoke and heat produced in the process can facilitate the growth of seeds of certain plant species.Apart from these,responsible human behavior can help reduce the number of forest fires to a great extent.In fact,we can reduce the number of wildfires dramatically by not leaving behind any source of fire in the forest.Forest fires can affect climate and weather to a great extent,besides causing severe damage to valuable trees.Wildfires can increase the level of greenhouse gases(water vapor, carbon dioxide,etc),and therefore increase pollution and global warming.However, they are also an important part of the ecosystem,and many plants depend on the heat and smoke generated by wildfires for their growth and reproduction.But large wildfires can cause extensive damage to the ecosystem,which again highlights the importance of effective control and prevention of forest fires*'], [30, 'Every one of the gymnasts who went to National Qualifiers   showed up with that goal in mind.

Unable to form all the emotions into words, I just looked away and avoided her questions."Tell me now why you\'re crying." Her voice this time wasn\'t as gentle as it was before; it was filled with frustration and impatience. "Why are you crying?" she whispered again, but this time her voice was shaky and flooded with pain. This was the first time I\'d ever seen my mom cry; my mom, who was always so strong and was there to encourage me through the roughest times, was now crying, and I was the reason for it. Finding my voice, I tentatively asked, "Why are you crying?"She looked at me and answered exactly what I was afraid to hear, "I hate to see you hurting yourself." So it was my fault. I had put those tears in her eyes. I had filled her with pain, with helplessness and with sadness.I\'ll never forget her pained expression.

When and how should tips be given? Generally, you should plan to tip your room steward   $3.00 to $3.50 per person, per day, and plan an equal amount for your dining room waiter, and half of that for the busboy . On most ships, tip the maitre d'  or dining room captain only if you ask for special favors or table-side service; $5 to $10 is normal. Barmen and wine stewards are tipped 10 to 15 percent, but many cruise lines will add this tip to your bar or drink bill. Check the bill to see how it is handled. Also, tips for special services such as salon && spa treatments and room service are left to the guest, depending on services offered. Sometimes tips are placed in envelopes from your cabin's stationery supply. Generally, passengers on cruises of 10 days or less will tip at the end of the cruise; on longer voyages, tipping weekly. As part of a new trend that seems likely to grow, Carnival, Holland America, Norwegian, Princess and Cunard now charge tips to your account  . Norwegian, for example, charges $10 per day, per guest, to cover service in the various dining rooms and your room steward. If you feel this amount needs to be increased or decreased, arrangements can be made onboard the ship, generally at the end of your cruise. A few lines do not encourage tipping, including Radisson Seven Seas, Seabourn, Silversea and Windstar. Crew members are reportedly higher paid and not tip dependent. Many passengers tip anyway for outstanding service or special favors and give them tips face to face immediately they get serviced. Tips on Tipping Cabin steward $3.00 to $3.50 per person per day Waiter $3.00 to $3.50 per person per day Assistant waiter $1.50 to $2.00 per person per day Bartender, wine and deck stewards 10-15% of the bill Maitre d' $5.00 to $10.00 tip for each special service"], [34, 'Normally a student must attend a certain number of courses in order to graduate, and each course which he attends gives him a credit which he may count towards a degree. In many American universities the total work for a degree consists of thirty-six courses, each lasting for one semester. A typical course consists of three classes per week for fifteen weeks; while attending a university a student will probably attend four or five courses during each semester. Normally a student would expect to take four years attending two semesters each year. It is possible to spread the period of work for the degree over a longer period. It is also possible for a student to move between one university and another during his degree course, though this is not in fact done as a regular practice.For every course that he follows a student is given a grade, which is recorded, and the record is available for the student to show to future employers. All this imposes a constant pressure and stress of work, but in spite of this some students still find time for great activity in student affairs. Elections to positions in student organizations arouse much enthusiasm. The effective work of maintaining discipline is usually performed by students who advise the academic authorities. Any student who is thought to have broken the rules, for example, by cheating has to appear before a student court. With the enormous numbers of students, the operation of the system does involve a certain amount of activity. A student who has held one of these positions of authority is much respected and will be of benefit to him later in his career.'], [35, "At the age of seven I started taking violin lessons. I practiced half an hour every day, went to lessons once a week, and occasionally played in a group concert. Like most kids, I always thought practicing was boring. If my parents hadn't been there to make me practice, I probably would have put down my violin and never have picked it up again.I met Moira when I was 11 at an Irish music party. Moira hosted the party that night, playing the violin, singing and dancing. She made sure that everyone in the room got involved and had a great time. I immediately fell in love with the music she played and the energy that she brought to it. Just a few days after that party, I took my first lesson with Moira, and I continued taking lessons with Moira throughout middle school.When I started playing the violin with Moira, playing music became something that I loved. She introduced me to so many types of music, from Irish to Old Time, to Cajun. Moira also taught me to play the guitar. Soon we started performing together and were shocked to discover that people actually wanted to hear us! When I began to play the violin, practicing was something that I did at home in my living room, but with Moira's influence it quickly became something that I did everywhere. I played on street corners, at festivals, at the beach, at parties, at weddings, and late at night in my friends' kitchens.Moira took the music out to the classroom and brought it to life. Her passion was not only for playing music, but also for sharing it. My time with Moira allowed me to grow both musically and personally.

Every year on my dad\'s birthday I draw a picture of him; each year he looks a bit different. I\'m an artist. It\'s not that I draw a straighter line or a truer circle, as they try to teach us to do at school. I just get the message across more clearly than other people. More truthfully.

Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children.The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes  were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes.In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others.The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experimentdistracted   kids from finding shapes.While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood.

The battle between form and function rose again when James Dyson, British inventor of the Dvson vacuum cleaner that has sold in millions around the world, resigned as chairman of London's Design Museum. It is widely believed that Mr. Dyson felt that the museum put too much stress on style at the expense of serious industrial design.Mr. Dyson accused the museum of not keeping true to itself. He may be right, but these days, museums everywhere can no longer afford to be unique centers of scholarship and learning. Among competition for sponsorship, they must use exhibitions of populist culture, nice cafes and shops or, best of all, a new building by Frank Gehry to increase visitor numbers.On the one hand, some producers can be too old-fashioned and too concerned with the importance of product engineering and the functionality of their goods. On the other hand, there are those who believe that how a product looks is more important. Design is indeed a broad term, involving both function and form. Typically, in any given product area, it changes from the former to the latter.  Clothing is a good example. But surely you would have to be a very shallow person to think something's appearance is more important than what it does.Today nearly all goods at any given price point do much the same job. So almost the  only way producers can differentiate their products from those of their competitors is to create some sort of emotional connection with the consumer, which could be through the visual appeal of the product or its packaging, or the imagery  created by advertising. And what of the Dyson vacuum cleaner? Mr. Dyson may believe that people buy these machines because of the graphs showing their superior suction, but most vacuum cleaners do a good job; the main reason people pay extra for a Dyson is that it is a vacuum cleaner with a fashionable  brand. With its inside workings exposed, it is a bit like a Richard Rogers building with all its pipes shown in bright colors on the outside instead of being hidden inside. Functional it may be, but it is a bit of a trick, too."], [40, 'There are three different kinds of friends in our life.

Five years ago, researchers found an area in the Atlantic Ocean seabed, where a part of the Earth\'s outer layer, or crust , is  missing. A thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed.The crust, mantle  and core  are the main layers that make up the planet. The mantle rests between the crust and the core.Last month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.The hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. "It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth," says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.The site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth\'s surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.The hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what\'s below the Earth\'s   surface.

And then there are the neurotic or unhealthy perfectionists who never feel satisfied but keep struggling towards impossible goals.These people often measure their own self-worth entirely in terms of productivity and accomplishment.It is necessary to notice if you are struggling and feel tense while trying to perfect your recipe, article, parenting, job, project, etc.You are fighting and resisting your own humanness.How do you know if you suffer from perfectionism?* Are you afraid of making mistakes?* Do you get impatient with others when they make a mistake?* If you fail an assignment at work or school, do you feel like a failure?* How do you feel when you read these questions?Your relationship with yourself is the foundation for all of your other relationships.If you are hard on yourself, then you\'ll in turn be hard on others.If we are unable to care for our innermost beings, then our lives will reflect this fault in some way.Embracing  your own humanness is the doorway to seeing the miracles of who you are at your best.Dr. Bemie Siegcl writes in his new book on miracles, "Our body loves us, but it needs to know we love our lives in order for it to do all it can to help us survive.The change in body energy motivated by the love leads to chemical changes in our body and makes a difference.In many cases, this kind of miracle needs hard work.But when you are willing to do the work, and live in your heart, it can happen."'], [53, 'A few months ago as I wandered through my parents\' house, the same house I grew up in, I had a sudden, scary realization. When my parents bought the house, in 1982, they were only two years older than I am now. I tried to imagine myself in two years, ready to settle down and buy the house I\'d still be living in almost 30 years later.    It seemed ridiculous. On a practical level, there\'s no way I could afford to buy a house anytime soon. More importantly, I wouldn\'t want to. I\'m not sure where I\'ll be living in two years, or what kind of job I\'ll have. And I don\'t think I\'ll be ready to settle down and stay in one place.    So this is probably the generation gap that divides my friends and me from our parents. When our parents were our age, they\'d gotten their education, chosen a career, and were starting to settle into responsible adult lives.    My friends and I - "Generation Y" - still aren\'t sure what we want to do with our lives. Whatever we end up doing, we want to make sure we\'re happy doing it. We\'d rather take risks first, try out different jobs, and move from one city to another until we find our favorite place. We\'d rather spend our money on travel than put it in a savings account.    This casual attitude toward responsibility has caused some critics to call my generation "arrogant", "impatient", and "overprotected". Some of these complaints have a point. As children ,we were encouraged to succeed in school, but also to have fun. We grew up in a world full of technological innovation: cellphones, the Internet, instant messaging, and video games.    Our parents looked to rise vertically --starting at the bottom of the ladder and slowly making their way to the top, on the same track, often for the same company. That doesn\'t apply to my generation.    Because of that, it may take us longer than our parents to arrive at responsible, stable adulthood. But that\'s not necessarily a bad thing. In our desire to find satisfaction, we will work harder, strive for ways to keep life interesting, and gain a broader set of experiences and knowledge than our parents\' generation did.

I felt strangely safe, knowing that even though we don\'t get along, she\'d done the right thing. So, the yummy cookies.Last winter, my neighbor carelessly let it out that she was holding a _ towards me because of an incident we\'d had four years ago. I had particularly apologized and asked if there was anything I could do to improve our relationship. She would not accept my apology.It had taken me a lot of courage to apologize and ask that question. Her refusal to make amends   really saddened me. After that, I decided I\'d just leave her be. So I was really scared she was going to refuse my offer again. I know some people have a hard time understanding how the possibility of rejection can make an adult so afraid, but that\'s just the way I felt.Then, I reminded myself of how good I had felt yesterday when I\'d done some acts of kindness after telling myself: Feel the fear, and do it anyway! So I put the cookies on a beautiful plate, opened my apartment door--and there she was, standing in the hallway. But when she saw me, she went back inside. I went after her and quickly said, "I\'m sorry, I\'ve got something for you! I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am that you were paying attention on Monday." When she heard me speaking, she turned around. As I held the plate towards her, her eyebrows winged up and she took the plate. I was so happy and excited.Back in my place, I did a "happy dance", because I had dared to be kind even though I hadn\'t been sure my kindness would be welcome.

The system, developed by Professor Ben Allen at the Centre for Wireless Research, uses radio waves as power.Believed to be a world first, the team claims it could eventually get rid of the need for conventional batteries. The university has now applied for a patent  application to secure the only rights to the technique.Professor Allen and his team have created a system to use medium wave frequencies to replace batteries in small everyday devices like clocks and remote controls.The new technique uses the "waste" energy of radio waves and has been developed as part of the university\'s research into "power harvesting". Professor Allen said that as radio waves have energy---like light waves, sound waves or wind waves---in theory, these waves could be used to create power."The new area of power harvesting technology promises to reduce our reliance on conventional batteries," he said. "It\'s really exciting way of taking power from sources other than what we would normally think of."The team is now waiting for the results of the patent application to secure recognition of the technique.

It was seen as a way to _ men and women in prison by helping them go straight when they got out.Those taxpayer-supported college classes were put to an end in the 1990s. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo would like to bring them back in the state, setting off a fierce new debate.A number of lawmakers in New York have promised to kill Cuomo\'s proposal  .Cuomo says reintroducing taxpayer-funded college classes in New York\'s prisons is a common-sense plan that will reduce the number of inmates who commit new crimes."You pay $ 60,000 for a prison cell for a year," Cuomo responded. "You put a guy away for 10 years, and that\'s $600,000. Right now, chances are almost half. Once he\'s set free, he\'s going to come right back."Cuomo says helping inmates get a college education would cost about $ 5,000 a year per person. He argues, "It\'s a small amount of money if it keeps that inmate from bouncing back into prison."But even some members of the governor\'s own party hate this idea. State Assemblywoman Addie Russell, whose upstate district includes three state prisons, says taxpayers just won\'t stand for inmates getting a free college education, while middle-class families struggle to pay for their kids\' college fees."That is the vast majority of feedback   that I\'m also getting from my constituents  ," she says.

To understand it, we need to monitor key life cycle events-flowering, the appearance of leaves the first frog calls of the spring-all around the world.

"Phenology" is what scientists call the study of the timing of events in nature.One of the group\'s first efforts depends on scientists and non-scientists alike to collect data about plant flowering and leafing every year. The program, called Project BudBurst, collects life cycle data on different kinds of common plants from across the prefix = st1 /United States."People don \'t have to be plant experts-they just have to look around and see what\'s in their neighbourhood,"says Jennifer Schwartz, an adviser with the project, "As we collect this data, we\'ll be able to predict how plants and communities of plants and animals will respond as the climate changes." That data will help scientists predict not only how natural communities may change but also how these changes will affect people.Scientists monitoring lilac   flowering in the western United States reported that in years when lilacs bloomed early - before May 20th-wildfires later in the summer and fall are larger and more severe.  _ , Jennifer says.Improved monitoring is an important step toward predicting how natural communities will respond to climate change."The best way for us to increase our knowledge of how plants and animals are responding to climate change is to increase the amount of data we have," he says.

Let us examine some of the expressions that use "hand".We will get a hand in this way. "To get a hand in" is to begin a job, to begin to know something about it. When we learn completely, we will be able to do it hands down. If we do the job well, we may end up with the upper hand. On the other hand, if the situation gets out of hand, it is out of control.We must consider another way of expressing phrase---- to hand it to someone. For example, I must hand it to you for understanding what we have discussed this far. You can also lend a hand to someone but without really giving up your hand. You lend a hand when you help someone. If someone is kind enough to lend us a hand then we surely do not want to bite the hand that feeds us. We do not want to repay his kindness by treating him badly.Now, we have a free hand to continue examining other "hand" expressions. It means you are free to act without getting permission from someone else.Maybe you can find a friend who wants to take a hand in our project. It would have to be someone who was interested in these expressions. Your friend may want to work hand in glove with us. That is good because that means he wants to work as closely with us as a glove covers the hand. Of course, there is a danger that he may look at our project and decide to take it in hand. That means he wants to tale it over. If that happens, we may throw up our hands because the situation seams hopeless. In fact, we may decide that it is time for us to end this project to wash our hands of " hand" expressions.'], [63, 'The question of what children learn, and how they should learn, is continually being debated and redebated. Nobody dares any longer to defend the old system, the learning of lessons parrot-fashion, the grammar-with-a-whip system, which was good enough for our grandparents. The theories of modem psychology have stepped in to argue that we must understand the need of children. Children are not just small adults; they are children who must be respected as much.Well, you may say, this is as it should be, a good idea. But think further. What happens? "Education" becomes the responsibility not of teachers, but of psychologists  . What happens then? Teachers worry too much about the psychological implications   of their lessons, and forget about the subjects themselves. If a child dislikes a lesson, the teacher feels that it is his fault, not the child\'s. So teachers worry whether history is "relevant" to modern young children. And do they dare to recount stories about violence? Or will this make the children themselves violent? Can they tell their classes about children of different races, or will this encourage racial hatred? Why teach children to write grammatical sentences? Verbal expression is better. Sums? Arithmetic? No: Real-life mathematical situations are more understandable.You see, you can go too far. Influenced by educational theorists, who have nothing better to do than to write books about their ideas, teachers leave their teacher-training colleges filled with grand, psychological ideas about children and their needs. They make elaborate, sophisticated (,) preparations and try out their "modem methods" on the long-suffering children. Since one "modem method" rapidly replaces another the poor kids will have had a good bellyful by the time they leave school. Frequently the modem methods are so sophisticated that they fail to be understood by the teachers, let alone the children; even more often, the relaxed discipline so essential for the " informal" feelings the class must have, prevents all but a handful of children from learning anything.'], [66, 'Medalists of the 1948 London Olympic Games look back on their summer of victory.SAMMY Lee, 91, U.S.GOLD AND BRONZE, DIVINGI first had my Olympic dream at 12, when they held the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles.

"We thought maybe a reason why these metaphors   appear was that there really was a connection between mood and identifying colors in a different way."Thorstenson and his team are not the first to identify a link between a depressed mood and a difference in recognition. In 2010, Emanuel Bubl and his team at Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg in Germany first proved a link between mood and identifying colors. This was supported by a 2013 paper by Johnson Fam of the University of Singapore.The team conducted two studies. In the first, 127 participants were chosen _ to watch one of two video clips, which had been proved in previous studies to feel either sadness or amusement. They didn\'t do that in a specific order.

For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies.

It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much!'], [79, 'The pupils of the remote Beau-Roc primary school in Haiti are chanting (singing the same words again and again).One of them plays a guitar made from an empty oil tin.Their headmistress, Emile Jean-Noel, is one of the few women school headteachers in the country.Today, over 70% of Haitian population live without proper food, water, schools, or housing.

Among the planet\'s inhabitants(,),the one that has the most similarities with humans is the Na\'vi, and it is the struggle between the Ma\'vi and human invaders  that forms the story of the film.As to the factors  leading to the film\'s success, many think that the entertaining feast  for the eyes and the wonderful story shouldn\'t be forgotten, but the new language invented especially for the film which provides audiences with a new experience also plays an important part.In order to increase the truthfulness of an alien race , the film\'s director James Cameron asked an expert in languages from the University of Southern California to invent a language for the Na\'vi. Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na\'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.According to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na\'vi language is that it could be pronounced. "This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses," Professor Frommer told the BBC, "it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it."The language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games. The professor hopes that one day his creation will be as successful as the Klingon alien language from the "Star Trek"films.

The idea is to encourage healthy eating to fight the country\'s increasing obesity rate. It\'s feared that basic cooking and food preparation skills are being lost as parents turn to pre-pre-pared convenience foods.Cooking was once regarded as an important part of education in England-even if it was mainly aimed at girls. In recent decades cooking has progressively become a minor activity in schools. In  many cases the schools themselves have given up cooking meals in kitchens in the schools .But the rising level of obesity has led to a rethink about the food that children are given and the skills they should be taught."What I want is to teach young people how to do basic, simple recipes like a tomato sauce, a bolognaise, a simple curry, a stir-fry-which they can use now at home and then in their later life", said Ed Balls, the minister responsible for schools.The new lessons are due to start in September, but some schools without kitchens will be given longer to adapt. There is also likely to be a shortage of teachers with the right skills, since the trend has been to teach food technology rather than practical cooking. Also the compulsory lessons for hands on cooking will only be one hour a week for one term. But the well-known cookery writer, Pru  Leith, believes it will be worth it ."If we\'d done this thirty years ago we might not have the crisis we\'ve got now about obesity and lack of knowledge about food and so on. Every child should know how to cook, not just so that they\'ll be healthy, but because it\'s a life skill which is a real pleasure".The renewed interest in cooking is primarily a response to the level of obesity in Britain which is among the highest in Europe, and according to government figures half of all Britains will be obese in 25 years if current trends are not stopped.'], [96, "The World Trade Organization (WTO) founded on January 1, 1994, aims to encourage international trade to flow as freely as possible, making sure that trade agreements are respected and that any disputes   can be settled.In the five years since its founding, the WTO has become well-known as one of the world's most powerful economic organizations, taking its place alongside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.The system of global rules for international trade, however, dates back half a century to 1948 when the General Agreement on Tariffs   and Trade (GATT) was formed after World War II.As time went by it became clear that the GATT had two major _ --the limited areas of trade it covered, and the lack of an effective system to settle disputes.After seven years of trade talks ending in 1994. the so-called Uruguay Round finally gave birth to the WTO, complete with an effective system to settle disputes and new rules covering trade in services and intellectual property  .Even after seven years of talks and 22500 pages of agreements there were still problems, especially the difficult-to-deal-with areas of agriculture and services.The WTO. with its head office in Geneva, has 135 members with 30 more waiting to join."], [97, "A  At a recent visit to the beautiful Keukenhof flower gardens in Holland, I learned about the practice of topping.As flowers grow, sometimes the growers cut off the tops of the flowers, which they believe causes the plants to invest more energy into flower growth and less into seed production.The expected result is flower buds that will produce higher quality flowers.This is the same with personal growth.Sometimes when we produce first results in a certain area, it can be helpful to cut them off and throw them away.This can free up energy for a stronger attempt elsewhere instead of settling into the comfort zone of satisfaction with the old results.After running my computer games business for 10 years and getting satisfying results with it, I decided to drop it and leave that field behind.This freed up my energy to focus on my personal development writing and speaking.If I'd kept running the old business, this would have meant less energy to invest in my new path.It can be difficult to choose the topping approach because you're taking something that's already reasonably satisfying and cutting it out of your life, in the hopes that something even better will grow in its place.Do you want to settle where you are right now? If so, then topping is unnecessary.But if you'd like to do better and believe you have a good shot at improvement, just like the flower growers at Keukenhof, then topping is a sensible practice.To free up time and energy for future growth in new directions, you have to drop the merely satisfactory.This gives you a shot at the truly beautiful.Stepping outside of your comfort zone is by definition an uncomfortable experience, but it can result in a lot more growth than staying put.Though dropping satisfaction to go for more growth is not an easy path to follow, I do find it to be the more beautiful path."], [99, 'The United States estimates that about one out of every 10 people on the planet today is at least 60 years old. By 2050, it\'s projected to be one out of 5. This means that not only will there be more old people, but there will be relatively fewer young people to support them.Professor Richard Lee of the University of California at Berkeley says this aging of the world has a great effect on economics. "Population aging increases the concentration of population in the older ages and therefore it is costly," he said.Aging populations consume   more and produce less. With more people living longer, it could get expensive. But Mr. Lee says with continuing increases in worker productivity and smart planning, it can be manageable.Societies have different methods for caring for the elderly, but each carries a cost. Generally, there are three types of support. Seniors can live off the wealth they gained when they were younger. They can rely on their family to take care of them, or they can rely on the government.In industrialized nations, governments created publicly-funded   support systems. These worked relatively well until recent years, when aging population growth in places like the United States and Western Europe began to gradually weaken the systems finances. These nations now face some tough choices. Mr. Lee says the elderly in some of these countries must either receive less money, retire later or increase taxes to make the system continuable.Most developing nations haven\'t built this type of government-funded support, but have instead relied on families to care for their elderly. These nations also generally have a much younger population, which means their situation is not as urgent as more developed nations. But Mr. Lee says that doesn\'t mean they can ignore the issue. "Third World countries should give very careful thought to this process, to population aging and how it may affect their economies -- now, before population aging even becomes an issue," he explained.'], [101, 'I am 26.

In 2013, Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun were combined to a one-ticket admission, providing all guests with access to  235 acres of amusement and water rides.Hours: Worlds of Fun is open from April through Halloween.Tickets: Buy and print online. Always try to buy your tickets in advance, to save time when you get to the park.Reservations: World of Fun sells " Fast Lane" cards that save rides\' time by allowing them to avoid the majority of wait for most of rides and attractions including Mamba, Plowler, and Patriot. Ride as many times as you want all day long.Strategy : Most visitors tend to  begin in the day with Prowler, the hottest attraction in the park. Use that tendency to your advantage and head to the Patriot first. After that, try the Dragons. Then work your way back to the Prowler. After riding the Prowler, there is only one roller coaster, Mamba. Hit it next. If the park is not very crowded, you can ride Boomerang on the way to Mamba. After riding Mamba, head back for a ride on the Wolf. By then you will have tried most of the popular rides and attractions in the shortest possible time.News: In 2014, Worlds of Fun is adding Steel Hawk, a ride that will take guests up 301 feet in the air and spin them at a 45-degree angle for a 60-second flight.

There was a woman who had been sitting in a corner booth for at least three hours. She asked me, "How much is just one breakfast taco  ?" I told her I\'d never served just one by itself. Going back to the kitchen I thought about her tired eyes. I offered her a free pancake breakfast. She asked to borrow the money for bus and promised to return and pay me back. I handed over tip money from my pocket. She smiled on her way out the front door.Three weeks later she returned my two dollars. She had gotten a job and a friend\'s bed to sleep on. She offered to buy me breakfast on my break!This kind of thing gets me wondering if something as simple as a breakfast can bring about a small change in society, then why not take it even further and see if one act of friendliness can start to make peace? I believe it can. Peace begins with one person but spreads. When I connect with my neighbors, they return it in kind.So I believe in friendliness and an open ear.

At one time, this was pretty much true. During the Roman Empire, lots of roads were built in order to move armies, send messages by courier  , and make trade easier. This construction work went on for five centuries! If all the roads built during the Roman Empire were put together end to end, they would circle the equator twice.The network of Roman roads was begun in 312 BC. It was demanded that the roads be built strong so that they would not fall down. Roman soldiers, supervised   by engineers, laid down the roads in a special pattern of layers. The first layer was made of sand. Next, the builders added rocks and rubble. On top of these materials came gravel. On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.Also, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.All Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile). The milestones told when the road was built, who was emperor at the time, the road\'s destination, how far the traveler was from the destination, and how many miles had been traveled since the beginning of the road. This information was a great help to travelers.Because of their excellence in construction, it really is no surprise that many parts of Roman road still exist today. These roadways are one of the most impressive accomplishments of the Roman Empire.'], [113, "Do you want to be productive at work or at home? Here's what you should do.1.

Our own planet, Earth, is becoming more and more crowed and polluted. Luckily, we can start again and build a better world on Mars. Here is what life could be like.First of all, transport should be much better. At present, our spaceships are too slow to carry large numbers of people to Mars -- it takes months. However, by 2100, spaceship can travel at half the speed of light. It might take us two or three days to get to Mars!Secondly, humans need food, water and air to live. Scientists should be able to develop plants that can be grown on Mars. These plants will produce the food and air that we need. However, can these plants produce water for us ? There is no answer now.There is a problem for us to live on Mars. Mars pulls us much less than the Earth does. This will be dangerous because we could easily jump too high and fly slowly away into space. To prevent this, humans on Mars have to wear special shoes to make themselves heavier.Life on Mars will be better than that on Earth in many ways, People will have more space.

Peiss theorizes that it was female\'s making up in what has been an all-male field that disturb some gentlemen.Peiss tells me that after the 30\'s , pulling out a make-up case was no longer an issue. It became an accepted practice. I asked if she feels free to apply lipstick at a professional lunch herself. Sounding mildly shocked, she says she would save that for the privacy of her car afterward. Why? Because it would be "a gesture of inappropriate feminity ."

This may show that the idea works best in medium-sized cities or large towns, where a greater sense of unity can be achieved. Or it may show that New Yorkers rather missed the point, putting all their energy and passion into the choice of the book rather than discussion about a book itself.Ultinatelas Nancy points out, the level of success is not measured by how many people read a book, but by how many people are enriched by the process, or have enjoyed speaking to someone with whom they would not otherwise have shared a word.'], [135, 'Are you stuck in a rut and looking for a change?

"While 10 years ago _ took financial and personal risks in volunteering abroad, now several organizations exist to make the experience safe and well-organized.Nowadays, universities and business encourage overseas volunteering among students and employees. Entire families can volunteer abroad, and agencies are employing more disabled and retired people. A prosperous "humanitarian tourism" industry has sprung up; thousands of UK citizens will do some form of overseas volunteering this year."Some volunteering jobs are easier to find than others," explains Kevin Cusack, from a volunteer advice agency. "If you can speak English, it\'s not too hard to land a job teaching English, even without a qualification, and those who enjoy working with children should be able to find child care work." zxxkWhether your interest is rainforests or women\'s rights, you can find a volunteer position to suit you. But be warned: unless you have relevant skills or existing overseas development experience, it\'s going to cost. Just how much depends on the location and length of the position, but you should budget for somewhere between PS1,500 and PS6,000."Having to pay to volunteer may sound paradoxical  , but it\'s the best way to ensure you get a position that benefits the local community while matching your interests and skills," explains Cusack.  "You can also discuss the time you want to commit to a project --- many positions can fit into a holiday or even a weekend."'], [137, "The size of the British Isles often leads people to think that the languages spoken in its countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are somewhat the same. At first, visitors are often surprised to find that they have difficulty in understanding the accents and dialects of certain regions. Even in England there are many different dialects.Experts believe that for most English people, the places they come from are very important to them. Accents are clues to where people were born and where they grew up. Although some people may change the way they speak during their lifetime, most people carry at least some evidence of their accents and dialects throughout their lives. In addition to the regional accents of England, there can also be class differences among the accents. People are often able to make instant and unconscious judgments about a stranger's class by listening to his or her accent. Both the words and the pronunciation of an individual reflect his or her social position.It is agreed that in England, the kind of English spoken by a person plays a leading role that generally is not important in North America. The importance of accents and their cultural and social relationships are well represented in films and on television in Britain. The film My Fair Lady based on George Bernard Shaw's 1912 play Pygmalion is often said to be a wonderful example of how social class and the accent were, and still are, linked in Britain."]]
Question and ModContext:[[[0, 'according to the passage, how long should a thirdgrader spend a day doing homework?choose between the following alphabet:a.about ten minutes..b.no more than twenty minutes..c.no more than thirty minutes..d.about fifty minutes..', "I am a psychologist. I first met Timothy, a quiet, overweight eleven-year-old boy, when his mother brought him to me to discuss his declining grades. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression. Having an extra two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend would soundly benefit any child's life quality."]], [[1, "according to the passage, which statement is not sure?choose between the following alphabet:a.forgetting your wife's favourite flower is a very serious mistake..b.it is common to call an old acquaintance his given name..c.the writer was in his twenties when he met john in the store..d.john and the writer studied in the same college..", 'I\'ve often had difficulty remembering names.
