Capital of Peace is one of its names-- the European headquarters of the United Nations lies here in Palais des Nations. Another worthy name for this city with a humanitarian tradition and international character is the World's Smallest Metropolis. Parks,splendid stores and lively streets in the old part of town and its 2000 -- year history wait to be discovered.The Jet d'Eau together with the Flower Watch are the main attractions every year for the tourists visiting Geneva. The Jet d'Eau has become the symbol of Geneva for a long time. This is a 140 meters high water monument with a rich history. Eight 13,500--watt projectors light the grand column of the fountain in the evening, from early March until the second Sunday of October. The Flower Watch, which was created at the edge of the English Garden in 1955,reminds us about that Geneva is the birthplace of the Swiss clock and watch making, and that this industry has become internationally famous, as well through the quality of the watches as through their beautiful appearance.Sails on Lake Geneva are also enjoyable. The Lake of Geneva, lying among the Alps, is a true inland sea, making possible a wide range of pleasant boat trips, you can relax and watch the beautiful scenes pass by."], [1, 'Carrying everything they need on their backs, three friends from England are setting out  to run 39 marathons across Eastern Europe.Tom, Rob and Guy ran the Marathon des Sables last year and were looking for another  challenge.Where do you go from there?" asks Tom.Then someone said, "Run 1,000 miles".And the idea was born.The three friends are running from Odessa in Ukraine to Dubrovnik in Croatia in 30 days,  to raise awareness of child trafficking  and to raise & 50,000 for the charity Love 146. The money will enab4 Love 146 to bui4 a home in the UK to provide specialist aftercare to  victims of child trafficking. The run - the equivalent of 39 marathons in 30 days - will take in nine different countries and pass through some of Eastern Europe\'s most remote terrain , without the help  of support vehicles or medical aid.The three men will carry everything they need, sleeping where they can and finding food and water along the way."What really inspires us is the idea that people will join us at various points along the way,  Forrest Gump-style," says Tom.If that sounds like your idea of fun,  it\'s not too late to sign up on their website and join them for a spot of extreme fundraising over the next month.The aim is to arrive in Dubrovnik on 3 May.Only days before they set off, I asked Tom what his biggest concern was at this late Stage.\'\'The cold," he said."We hadn\'t imagined Europe would be this cold in April.Some nights the plan is to sleep outside in the camping bags.I\'m terrified about the weather."'], [2, '"Chances are we have all experienced shyness in our lives, and shyness has been associated with negative outcomes--characteristics like difficulty maintaining eye contact, and feelings of humiliation  are known to be part of a shy person\'s characters. It\'s these traits that tend to affect some shy individuals\' ability to connect," says C. Barr Taylor, a professor of psychology at Stanford University."But while shyness can often be seen as a bad thing, there are ways to use the personality trait to your advantage," Taylor says. Below are some common shy habits and how you can learn to make them benefit you:Shy people usually reflect inwardly   a lot. But according to Taylor,all that thinking may not always be a bad thing and it should be viewed as a way you can think actively as you go into a situation. So, for shy people who feel worried about facing a particular challenge or event, Taylor advises slowly approaching the fearful situation if you start to feel anxious. By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. "Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted," he says. "If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it." What\'s more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.Shy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. "Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations," Taylor says. "It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room." In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren\'t shy. In addition, a shy person has a born drive to absorb a conversation, so they can be great at conversation.'], [3, "The twenty-four horses dash around a racetrack. The thunder of their hooves   rings in the riders' ears, nearly drowning out the cheering of the crowd. After three or four minutes of suspense, one horse crosses the finish line first, winning the Melbourne Cup and earning a place in history.The horses that compete in the Melbourne Cup--one of the world's most famous horseraces--were fated to race. Bred for speed, these horses are the few that were singled out as having potential to become champions.Preparing a racehorse to compete requires a team. A horse's owner manages the team and decides which races to enter. A trainer determines the racehorse's diet and exercise. Regular exercise makes a horse less likely to be injured, but overtraining tires the horse. A groomer   cares for the racehorse and reports any problems he discovers to the trainer. And of course, no horserace could be run without a rider. These riders train for long hours and travel constantly from one race to another. They need to make a strategy, adapt to changing conditions and communicate with their horse to guide it to victory.Australia's most famous horserace, the Melbourne Cup, is 3,200 meters of pure excitement. Each year 300 or 400 horses are nominated  , but only 24 can run. The competitors are chosen based on a number of factors, but winners of certain races qualify automatically.Each racehorse receives a handicap--a certain weight it must carry to give each horse an equal chance of winning--two months before the race. Originally, horses that seemed likely to win were assigned larger handicaps. But the rules have changed, reducing the handicap for previous winners.The first Melbourne Cup in 1861 drew a crowd of 4,000 spectators, and the race's popularity has grown since then. Held on the first Tuesday of November, the cup has become a four-day festival with fine food and entertainment.The Melbourne Cup began during a gold rush as a form of entertainment for the rich. Today it still attracts society's upper class. They come dressed in their finest to enjoy the event in comfort.But anyway it's all about the race--the effort of horses and riders, the suspense and the thrill of victory."], [4, 'As a young ice skater, I had flown pretty high, pretty quickly. My partner and I won the Canadian junior pairs championship when I was 14. Later I was thrilled to be picked to skate in the 1994 Olympics in lillehammer, Norway. But then everything came down.    We finished the 12th at the Games. I soon quit double skating and tried to continue in singles. But I wasn\'t good enough; I didn\'t even compete in the next two national championships. I felt like I was a somebody who had become a nobody.    I was 18 and had just graduated from high school, when my mum told me, "You can\'t just depend on skating to make a living. You\'d better find a job." I knew she was right. So I found a job at a restaurant where I waited at tables and did anything else that needed to be done. In fact, I worked so hard that I had never got the chance to have a break. No one cared that I had been an Olympic skater; I was judged only by how hard I worked.    That job taught me so many things. I learned, for example, how to deal with people. As an athlete, this was new to me. One day a man loudly called me over to his table and complained, "This milk is sour. I am not drinking this junk! I want my money back! " It was near the end of my shift   and I wanted to tell him how rude I thought he was. But I had learned that "the customer is always right" and a smile can go a long way. "I\'m really sorry, sir. I\'ll get you a free cup." I said with a smile. When I brought him his coffee, his attitude changed. And he left me a tip!    My first job taught me that it is important to do your best at anything you try. I knew nothing about being a waitress when 1 started my job but by the time I left when 1 decided to return to skating -- I had earned a raise and my boss\'s praise. They meant so much to me.'], [5, 'In the kitchen of my mother\'s houses there has always been a wooden stand with a small notepad and a hole for a pencil.    I\'m looking for paper on which to note down the name of a book I am recommending to my mother.Over forty years since my earliest memories of the kitchen pad and pencil, five houses later, now the paper and pencil look the same as they always did.Surely it can\'t be the same pencil. The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is surely the original one.    "I\'m just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years." I say to her, "Can\'t you afford a new one?"    My mother replies ,"It works perfectly well.I\'ve always kept the stand in the kitchen.I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days."She smiles and says, "One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a great thought, but the stand was empty.One of the children must have taken the paper.So I just picked up the breadboard  and wrote it all down on the back.The idea turned out to be really helpful in solving the mathematical problem I was working on."This story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how special my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician.I feel ashamed that I complain  about not having enough child-free time to work.Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards.Sure enough, on the back of the smallest one, are some penciled marks I recognize as mathematics.Those marks have travelled through fifty years, rooted in a cheap wooden breadboard, exhibits at every meal.'], [6, 'In a movie, a woman reads a storybook to her friend\'s daughter.

It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common; or rather, any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet the needs of that particular group.Research suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by different individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to "get things done". Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective well-beings  of a social group\'s members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them.Instrumental leaders are likely to have a rather secondary relationship to other group members. They give others and may discipline group members who inhibit  attainment of the group\'s goals. Expressive leaders develop a more personal or primary relationship to others in the group. They offer sympathy when someone experiences difficulties and try to solve problems that threaten to divide the group. As the difference between these two roles suggests, expressive leaders generally receive more personal affection from group members; instrumental leaders, if they are successful in promoting group goals, may enjoy a more distant respect.'], [8, 'According to a recent study out of the University of Pennsylvania\'s Wharton School, men with shaved heads are considered to be more manly, powerful, and successful than those with longer hair or thinning  hair. Besides, in some cases, they are considered to have greater leadership potential  . That may explain why the power-buzz look has become popular among business leaders in recent years.Albert Mannes, Wharton management lecturer, said he was encouraged to do the research after noticing that he was treated with more respect when he shaved off his thinning hair.Mannes did three experiments to test people\'s impression of men with shaved heads. In one of the experiments, he showed 344 subject photos of the same men in two versions: one showing the men with hair and the other showing them with their hair digitally removed, so their heads appear shaved. In all three tests, the subject report found the men with shaved heads are more dominant  than their hairy counterparts .The study found that men with thinning hair were viewed as the least attractive and powerful. For those men, _ .New York image consultant Julie Rath advised her clients to get closely cropped when they start thinning up top. "There is something really strong, powerful and confident about laying it all bare ," she said, describing the thinning look as kind of raunchy .Not everyone needs a bare head. Rick Devine, 55, the CEO of Devine Capital Partners, advised executive candidates attracted by their clippers to keep their hair closely cropped, rather than completely shaved. "It is way too much image risk," he said, "The best thing you can do in a business meeting is to make your look not an issue."'], [9, 'Researchers at the University of Bedforshire have developed a new technique for powering electronic device . The system, developed by Professor Ben Allen at the Centre for Wireless Research, uses radio waves as power.Believed to be a world first, the team claims it could eventually get rid of the need for conventional batteries. The university has now applied for a patent  application to secure the only rights to the technique.Professor Allen and his team have created a system to use medium wave frequencies to replace batteries in small everyday devices like clocks and remote controls.The new technique uses the "waste" energy of radio waves and has been developed as part of the university\'s research into "power harvesting". Professor Allen said that as radio waves have energy---like light waves, sound waves or wind waves---in theory, these waves could be used to create power."The new area of power harvesting technology promises to reduce our reliance on conventional batteries," he said. "It\'s really exciting way of taking power from sources other than what we would normally think of."The team is now waiting for the results of the patent application to secure recognition of the technique. Professor Allen said that the team\'s achievements had all been done in their "spare time". "Our next stage is to try and raise some real funds so that we can take this work forward and make a working pattern and maybe partner up with the right people and take this to a full product in due course," he said."Power harvesting has a really important part in our future, because, just in this country, we leave somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 tons of batteries in landfill sites every single year-that is poisonous chemicals going into the ground."He added that development of the product could also be "commercially  beneficial". "The market for this is several billion pounds. We\'ve seen market predictions for 2020 which have these kinds of figures, so there\'s a lot of commercial potential in this area," he said.Pro-Vice Chancellor at the University of Bedfordshire, Professor Carsten Maple said, "This type of work is a reflection of the university\'s growing reputation and experience in carrying out creating research."'], [10, 'America used to have a strong college education system for prison inmates (prisoners). It was seen as a way to _ men and women in prison by helping them go straight when they got out.Those taxpayer-supported college classes were put to an end in the 1990s. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo would like to bring them back in the state, setting off a fierce new debate.A number of lawmakers in New York have promised to kill Cuomo\'s proposal  .Cuomo says reintroducing taxpayer-funded college classes in New York\'s prisons is a common-sense plan that will reduce the number of inmates who commit new crimes."You pay $ 60,000 for a prison cell for a year," Cuomo responded. "You put a guy away for 10 years, and that\'s $600,000. Right now, chances are almost half. Once he\'s set free, he\'s going to come right back."Cuomo says helping inmates get a college education would cost about $ 5,000 a year per person. He argues, "It\'s a small amount of money if it keeps that inmate from bouncing back into prison."But even some members of the governor\'s own party hate this idea. State Assemblywoman Addie Russell, whose upstate district includes three state prisons, says taxpayers just won\'t stand for inmates getting a free college education, while middle-class families struggle to pay for their kids\' college fees."That is the vast majority of feedback   that I\'m also getting from my constituents  ," she says. "You know, \'Where is the relief for the rest of the population who obey the law ?\' ""I was very disappointed that the policy had been changed," says Gerald Gaes, who served as an expert on college programs for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the 1990s. In 1994, President Clinton stopped federal student aid programs for inmates.Gaes says research shows that college classes actually save taxpayers\' money over time, by reducing the number of inmates who break the law and wind up back in those expensive prison cells."It is cost-effective," he says. "Designing prisons that way will have a long-term benefit for New York State."'], [12, 'There are hundreds of expressions of words using "hand" in the English language. Let us examine some of the expressions that use "hand".We will get a hand in this way. "To get a hand in" is to begin a job, to begin to know something about it. When we learn completely, we will be able to do it hands down. If we do the job well, we may end up with the upper hand. On the other hand, if the situation gets out of hand, it is out of control.We must consider another way of expressing phrase---- to hand it to someone. For example, I must hand it to you for understanding what we have discussed this far. You can also lend a hand to someone but without really giving up your hand. You lend a hand when you help someone. If someone is kind enough to lend us a hand then we surely do not want to bite the hand that feeds us. We do not want to repay his kindness by treating him badly.Now, we have a free hand to continue examining other "hand" expressions. It means you are free to act without getting permission from someone else.Maybe you can find a friend who wants to take a hand in our project. It would have to be someone who was interested in these expressions. Your friend may want to work hand in glove with us. That is good because that means he wants to work as closely with us as a glove covers the hand. Of course, there is a danger that he may look at our project and decide to take it in hand. That means he wants to tale it over. If that happens, we may throw up our hands because the situation seams hopeless. In fact, we may decide that it is time for us to end this project to wash our hands of " hand" expressions.'], [13, 'Medalists of the 1948 London Olympic Games look back on their summer of victory.SAMMY Lee, 91, U.S.GOLD AND BRONZE, DIVINGI first had my Olympic dream at 12, when they held the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. My father and I were at a grocery store, and I asked, "What are all the flags doing here?" He said, "We are having the Olympic Games. That\'s where they honor the greatest athletes in the world." I said, "Papa, someday I\'m going to be an Olympic champ."Walking up the 10-meter platform, I thought to myself, "I\'ve waited 16 years for this moment. Am I going to win?" So I prayed to God that I was most deserving of winning the Games.DAVID BOND, 90, BRITAINGOLD, SAILINGDuring the war, I spent six years in Royal Air Force. I think in general, the 1948 Olympics meant very little to most people. We were too busy after the war to be worried about sport very much anyway.Our team had about six weeks before the Olympics down at Torquay and we went out sailing every day.Winning gold was quite something. It was nice to stand on the platform with lots of people cheering. We celebrated by going to a big dance.MICHAEL LAPAGE, 88, BRITAINSILVER, ROWINGI started rowing when I was 14. I joined the navy in 1942. In 1945 the war came to an end and I started rowing again.In 1948 we were still on rations  : 4 oz. of red meat a week. But the United States had all the meat they wanted. They were the favorites to win.On the day of the final, we led the Americans at the start, but their stronger staying power took them through to win. There were no ribbons on the medals, so we just showed them round the family.THOMAS GODWIN, 91, BRITAINBRONZE, CYCLINGAt 14 I left school and got a job delivering groceries on a bicycle, which excited my interest in cycling.

I was shocked when the monitor shouted, "stand up!" The entire class rose as I entered the room and l was somewhat confused about how to get them to sit down again,but once the embarrassment  was over, I quickly regained my calmness and admiration. I went back to my office with the rosy glow which came from a strong sense of achievement.    My students kept diaries. However, as I read them the rosy glow was gradually replaced by a strong sense of sadness.The first diary said, "Our literature teacher didn\'t teach us anything today perhaps her next lecture will be better." Greatly surprised.I read diary after diary, each expressing a similar theme. "Didn\'t I teach them anything? I described the entire Western  _ and laid the historical background for all the works we will study in class," I complained. "How should they say I didn\'t teach them anything?"    It was a long term, and it gradually became clear that my ideas about education were not the same as those of my students. I thought a teacher\'s job was to raise interesting questions and provide enough background so that students could draw their own conclusions. My students thought a teacher\'s job was to provide exact information as directly and clearly as possible. What a difference!

He had a sister, Joan, and two younger brothers, Gilbert and Richard. And the next year he had another brother, Edmund. After William's parents died, he and his sister lived with his mother's brother. I became his friend from that day until he died. We met nearly every day.

The pet insurance business is booming.

According to the American Pet Products Association, 62 percent households in the U.S. own a pet. It\'s estimated that owners will spend about $55.5 billion on goods and services for their pets this year, up about $2 billion from last year.That\'s a small price to pay for the unconditional love and loyalty you get from a pet. The bond between dog and dog owner began about 30,000 years ago when dogs started to become domesticated  . Since then, dogs have become faithful companions not only at home but also as service dogs, in the workplace and on the battlefield.In addition to the unconditional love, companionship and sense of security that comes with dog ownership, there are also many health benefits.

You may blame your friends,"They are not kind.Who needs them anyway?" Or you may tell your friends how you feel,listen to their explanation,and let them know you\'d like to be invited next time.When you decide everything in your own way,you\'re getting hold of your own life and shaping it according to your tastes and feelings.You can choose to be happy,to make friends and to build an interesting life.When you blame others for what is or isn\'t happening in your life,you have stopped growing or learning.One of the most important rules is that you can never change another person by your direct action.The only person you have the right to change is yourself.Once you change,the other person has something different to respond to and change is possible.If you want change in your life,begin with yourself.'], [19, 'Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollywood in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called "Bollywood." Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a "masala" film. ("Masala" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much!'], [20, 'I travel a lot, and I find out different "styles" of directions every time I ask "How can I get to the post office?"Foreign tourists are often confused  in Japan because most streets there don\'t have names; in Japan, people use landmarks in their directions instead of street names.

It was said that Leonardo often painted continuously from dawn to night without eating his meals. But at other times he spent hours before the picture, lost in contemplation, examining, comparing, and measuring his figures.This inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior, the head of the church, who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems, the more he accomplishes; and so he tried to find fault with the idle  painter. Leonardo was slightly unhappy and explained to somebody else that there is a great difference between the work of the creative artist and the stonemason . The creative artist needs time for contemplation; he may be busiest when his hands are idlest. Just now he needed two heads to complete the picture: that of Christ, for which no model on earth could be found, for where was the man to be found whose face would express the strength, and beauty, and tenderness, and deep sorrow of the Christ; then he also needed a head of Judas, and that was hard to find as well, for where was the man whose face could express the meanness of that base traitor .

Do you wear fine clothes? Do you look rich? If so, be careful. There is a pickpocket looking for you. World travelers, away from home and usually carrying much money, are often troubled by pickpockets in foreign countries, but they should remember that there are pickpockets in their own country, too.              A typical pickpocket is under forty years of age, usually a male. He has nimble fingers and has trained himself in running. Generally, he carries a newspaper or magazine in his hand. He may appear fairly clever and pretend to be calm. He has learned his job from another pickpocket, and he repays his "teacher" by giving him a percentage of the money or things which he steals.              The skilled pickpocket always operates in crowded places. Very well-dressed men and slightly drunken men are the favorite objects of the pickpocket.              An average-sized department store hires about six or seven full-time detectives. These men and women are constantly looking for pickpockets quickly. But a good pickpocket knows these things and is very careful. He is especially busy on buses, trains and subways between 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. when there are many shoppers with much money to spend. He carefully remembers the payday and bonus times of companies.              Pickpocketing and stealing from a shop together represent about 75% of daytime little crimes in America. The sentence for these crimes is usually from three to five years in prison.

It turned out to be a great success. The film got $1 billion in ticket sales in a very short time. The story in the film happens on an alien planet called Pandora where many strange species live. Among the planet\'s inhabitants(,),the one that has the most similarities with humans is the Na\'vi, and it is the struggle between the Ma\'vi and human invaders  that forms the story of the film.As to the factors  leading to the film\'s success, many think that the entertaining feast  for the eyes and the wonderful story shouldn\'t be forgotten, but the new language invented especially for the film which provides audiences with a new experience also plays an important part.In order to increase the truthfulness of an alien race , the film\'s director James Cameron asked an expert in languages from the University of Southern California to invent a language for the Na\'vi. Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na\'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.According to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na\'vi language is that it could be pronounced. "This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses," Professor Frommer told the BBC, "it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it."The language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games. The professor hopes that one day his creation will be as successful as the Klingon alien language from the "Star Trek"films. "There\'s a translation of Hamlet into Klingon and it has received great popularity among the audiences," says Professor Frommer,"if anything like this happens to the Na\'vi language, I\'d be very happy."'], [32, 'Most of my friends are moving outside the city.. to avoid the noise, smog, traffic, and crime of the city.One friend says, "The air is heavily polluted in the city, so I prefer to live outside, where the air is clean."Another friend is unpleased with the traffic, "Downtown is crowded with cars!

If so, then topping is unnecessary.But if you'd like to do better and believe you have a good shot at improvement, just like the flower growers at Keukenhof, then topping is a sensible practice.To free up time and energy for future growth in new directions, you have to drop the merely satisfactory.This gives you a shot at the truly beautiful.Stepping outside of your comfort zone is by definition an uncomfortable experience, but it can result in a lot more growth than staying put.Though dropping satisfaction to go for more growth is not an easy path to follow, I do find it to be the more beautiful path."], [35, 'prefix = st1 /      SYDNEY: As they sat sharing sweets beside a swimming pool in 1999, Shane Gould and Jessicah Schipper were simply getting along well, chatting about sport, life and "anything else that came up."Yet in Sydney next month, they will meet again by the pool, and for a short time the friends will race against each other in the 50-meter butterfly  in the Australian championships at Homebush Bay.

With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog? Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.   What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.  We prison people who abuse animals, put ourselves in harm's way in boats between whales and whalers and show sympathy to Bambi and his mother. We can extend sympathy to an animal and feel its pain like no other species. But let's not be too proud of ourselves. As this study and too much of our history show, we're pretty selective about how we extend our kindness to other human beings."], [46, 'Even as Americans have been gaining weight, they have cut their average fat intake from 36 to 34 percent of their total diets in the past 15 years.  And indeed,  cutting fat  to control or lose weight makes sense. Fat has nine calories per gram. Protein and carbohydrates  have just four. Moreover, the body uses fewer calories to metabolize fat than it does to metabolize other foods. Compared with protein and carbohydrates -- which break down into amino acids and simple sugars, respectively, and can be used to strengthen and energize the body ---- dietary fat is more easily converted to body fat. Therefore, it\'s more likely to stay on buttocks, thighs and bellies.But cutting fat from your diet doesn\'t necessarily mean your body won\'t store fat. For example, between nonfat and regular cookies, there\'s trivial difference in calories because manufacturers make up for the loss of fat by adding sugar. Low-fat crackers, soups and dressings can also be just as high in calories as richer versions. No matter where the calories come from, overeating will still cause weight again. The calories from fat just do it a little quicker. A Wisconsin computer programmer who decided with a diet coach to eat only 40 grams of fat a day learned the lesson firsthand. He wasn\'t losing weight. Then he showed his food diary to his coach and revealed he\'d been eating half a pound of jelly beans a day. "They don\'t have any fat," he explains. But they had enough sugar to keep him from shedding an ounce. Nonfat foods become add-on foods. When we add them to our diet, we actually increase the number of calories we eat per day and gain weight. That was borne out in a Pennsylvania State University study. For breakfast, Prof. Barbara Rolls gave two groups of women yogurt that contained exactly the same amount of calories. One group\'s yogurt label said "high fat"--the other, "low fat." The "low fat" yogurt group ate significantly more calories later in the day than the other group. "People think they\'ve saved fat and can indulge themselves later in the day with no adverse consequences," says Richard Mattes, a nutrition researcher at Purdue University. "But when they do that, they don\'t compensate very precisely, and they often end up overdoing it."'], [47, 'Extract 1A computer is an "information processor".It is given information,called "data",instructed to do certain things and then show us the results.The data put into the computer is called the"input" and the results which come out are the "output".Some people say the circle of large standing stones at Stonechenge is a kind of computer.Prehistory people worked out their calendar from the position of the shadows made by the sun shining on the stones.Extract 2Teach yourself new subjects and skills at your own pace with a home computer.Use it to help with schoolwork,for self-improvement,even to improve your career skills.Learn touchtyping.

The donkeys worked hard every day. They had  no time to play or to relax, but they never felt appreciated for the work they did.One day two donkeys got bored. They wanted to live a comfortable life. So the donkeys went  to see a wise old man. They told him their problem. The wise old man agreed that they worked too hard, and he wanted to help the donkeys. "I have an idea." he said."What is your idea?" asked the donkeys."I will paint you and no one will know you are donkeys," said the man.The man went off to find some paint and he returned in just a matter of minutes. He had two  pots of paint. One pot was filled with white paint, and the other black paint.The old man first painted them white,  and  then  painted  black  stripes  over the  white  paint.  When he finished, the donkeys did not look at all like donkeys.  "You no longer look like  donkeys, "  the old man said.   " Everyone will be fooled.  I will call you something else,  zebras. "The zebras went to a field to eat grass. Now they did not have to work.Soon, other donkeys saw the zebras. They asked the zebras where they came from. When the \' zebras told the donkeys their secret, the donkeys all rushed to see the old man."Make us into zebras, too," they pleaded. So the wise old man painted more donkeys. As  he did, more and more donkeys came.The old man could not paint fast enough. Soon the donkeys became impatient. They began to  kick about, and they knocked over the paint pots.There was no more paint. The painted donkeys ran off to become zebras. The unpainted don- keys, because of their impatience, had to return to work.This is ,why it is important to be patient.'], [49, 'There are many American expressions about insects--- like bees, for example. Bees are known as very hard workers. They appear to be busy, moving around their homes, or hives  . So you might say you were as busy as a bee if you spent your weekend cleaning your house. In fact, you might say your house was a beehive of activity if your whole family was helping you clean. You also might say you made a beeline for something if you went there right away. When we go to see a movie, my friend always makes a beeline for the place where they sell popcorn   .Here is an expression about bees that is not used much any more, but we like it anyway. We think it was first used in the 1920s. If something was the best of its kind, you might say it was the bee\'s knees. Now, we admit that we do not know how this expression developed. In fact, we do not even know if bees have knees!If your friend cannot stop talking about something because she thinks it is important, you might say she has a bee in her bonnet  . If  someone asks you a personal question, you might say "that is none of your beeswax". This means none of your business.Speaking of personal questions, there is an expression when their children ask, "Where do babies come from?" Parents who discuss sex and reproduction   say this is talking about the birds and bees.Butterflies are beautiful insects, but you would not want to have butterflies in your stomach. That means to be nervous about having to do something, like speaking in front of a crowd. You would also not want to have ants in your trousers. That is, to be unable to sit still.'], [50, 'Are you stuck in a rut and looking for a change? Fed up of seeing hungry, poor faces on your TV screen and want to do something to help? Perhaps you\'ve considered volunteering overseas but ruled it out because you thought you were too old, couldn\'t commit enough time, or have a family. If so, think again."Over the past five years it has become far safer --- and more professionally acceptable --- to take up a job volunteering overseas," says David Stitt, managing director of Gap Year for Grown Ups, a company catering for volunteers in their late 20s and upwards. "While 10 years ago _ took financial and personal risks in volunteering abroad, now several organizations exist to make the experience safe and well-organized.Nowadays, universities and business encourage overseas volunteering among students and employees. Entire families can volunteer abroad, and agencies are employing more disabled and retired people. A prosperous "humanitarian tourism" industry has sprung up; thousands of UK citizens will do some form of overseas volunteering this year."Some volunteering jobs are easier to find than others," explains Kevin Cusack, from a volunteer advice agency. "If you can speak English, it\'s not too hard to land a job teaching English, even without a qualification, and those who enjoy working with children should be able to find child care work." zxxkWhether your interest is rainforests or women\'s rights, you can find a volunteer position to suit you. But be warned: unless you have relevant skills or existing overseas development experience, it\'s going to cost. Just how much depends on the location and length of the position, but you should budget for somewhere between PS1,500 and PS6,000."Having to pay to volunteer may sound paradoxical  , but it\'s the best way to ensure you get a position that benefits the local community while matching your interests and skills," explains Cusack.  "You can also discuss the time you want to commit to a project --- many positions can fit into a holiday or even a weekend."'], [51, "The size of the British Isles often leads people to think that the languages spoken in its countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are somewhat the same. At first, visitors are often surprised to find that they have difficulty in understanding the accents and dialects of certain regions. Even in England there are many different dialects.Experts believe that for most English people, the places they come from are very important to them. Accents are clues to where people were born and where they grew up. Although some people may change the way they speak during their lifetime, most people carry at least some evidence of their accents and dialects throughout their lives. In addition to the regional accents of England, there can also be class differences among the accents. People are often able to make instant and unconscious judgments about a stranger's class by listening to his or her accent. Both the words and the pronunciation of an individual reflect his or her social position.It is agreed that in England, the kind of English spoken by a person plays a leading role that generally is not important in North America. The importance of accents and their cultural and social relationships are well represented in films and on television in Britain. The film My Fair Lady based on George Bernard Shaw's 1912 play Pygmalion is often said to be a wonderful example of how social class and the accent were, and still are, linked in Britain."]]
