[{"test case number": 0, "context": "I am a psychologist. I first met Timothy, a quiet, overweight eleven-year-old boy, when his mother brought him to me to discuss his declining grades. A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount). Having an extra two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend would soundly benefit any child's life quality.", "modContext": "My profession is in psychology.The first time I met Timothy, a quiet, overweight eleven-year-old boy, was when his mother brought him to me to discuss his declining academic performance.After spending a few minutes with Timothy, it was clear that his self-esteem and overall happiness were on the upswing.I questioned Timothy about his usual activities.He woke up at six thirty to ensure he was on time for his school and arrived home at approximately four thirty every afternoon.Following that, he had a quick snack and then proceeded to play either piano or receive math instruction from his tutor.He finished his dinner at 7 pm and then spent two to three hours on his homework.In my mind, I calculated that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours each day at a writing desk.Suppose Timothy were to sit at his desk for thirteen hours a day, what would be the result?We would be shocked by the description of children being horribly mistreated, which is not accurate.Timothy's childhood was being taken away due to the overwhelming homework he had to complete every day, despite not being mistreated.Timothy was unable to find the time to engage in activities that he enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his peers.Healthy child development is closely linked to play.It hinders children's creativity, social skills, and brain development.Many children suffer from a lack of play, physical activity, and social isolation.Additionally, it can lead to serious health concerns such as childhood obesity, sleep disturbances, and depression.The experts in the field suggest that children's homework time should not exceed ten times their grade level.Timothy should not exceed fifty minutes per day for homework as a fifth-grader, rather than three times the recommended amount.Any child's life quality would benefit greatly if they had two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend.", "question": "what did the writer think of timothy after learning about his typical day?choose between the following alphabet:a.timothy was very hardworking..b.timothy was being mistreated..c.timothy had a heavy burden..d.timothy was enjoying his childhood..", "groundTruth": "denver broncos", "answer": "c. timothy had a heavy burden", "modAnswer": "c. timothy had a heavy burden", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": []},

Bred for speed, these horses are the few that were singled out as having potential to become champions.Preparing a racehorse to compete requires a team. A horse's owner manages the team and decides which races to enter. A trainer determines the racehorse's diet and exercise. Regular exercise makes a horse less likely to be injured, but overtraining tires the horse. A groomer   cares for the racehorse and reports any problems he discovers to the trainer. And of course, no horserace could be run without a rider. These riders train for long hours and travel constantly from one race to another. They need to make a strategy, adapt to changing conditions and communicate with their horse to guide it to victory.Australia's most famous horserace, the Melbourne Cup, is 3,200 meters of pure excitement. Each year 300 or 400 horses are nominated  , but only 24 can run. The competitors are chosen based on a number of factors, but winners of certain races qualify automatically.Each racehorse receives a handicap--a certain weight it must carry to give each horse an equal chance of winning--two months before the race. Originally, horses that seemed likely to win were assigned larger handicaps.

Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to \"get things done\". Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective well-beings  of a social group's members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them.Instrumental leaders are likely to have a rather secondary relationship to other group members.

In 1998, they were proven completely wrong. Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. One possible explanation is that empty space has a thing called dark energy, which supposedly makes up about three quarters of the universe. Dark energy supposedly very sparsely  exists in such a way that it interacts with other objects only through attracting force. It has a strong negative pressure, which causes it to pull on its surroundings and as a result, pull apart the universe. This neatly explains the universe's expansion without completely changing our understanding of the universe. Scientists can merely claim that dark energy \"should\" exist. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, it is impossible to travel faster than at the speed of light. With this in mind, physicists set out to do the impossible and succeeded. In 2000, scientists in Princeton, New Jersey sent a small pulse  of laser light through a vapor made up of gaseous cesium . The pulse traveled so quickly that it was already leaving the vapor-filled chamber as it was still entering, roughly 300 times faster than it would have in a vacuum . Thus, light moved faster than the speed of light. Other experiments have since managed to conquer light's supposed speed limit, though all claims have had fine print that keeps them from being especially groundbreaking .

It was an extremely uncomfortable arrangement to be looking straight into the eyes of a stranger. My husband and I pulled out books. The woman produced a large makeup case and made up her face. Except for a lunch break, she continued this activity for the entire three-hour trip. Every once in a while she surveyed the car with a bright-eyed glance, but never once did she catch my eye. _ .I was amused, but some people would have felt uncomfortable , even repulsed .there is something about making up in public that calls up strong emotional reactions. Partly it's a question of hygiene. And it's a matter of degree. Making up --- a private act--- has a way of neglecting the presence of others. I was once seated at a party with a model-actress who immediately waved a silly brush and began dusting her face at the table, demonstrating that while she was next to me, she was not with me.In fact, I am generally prohibited from making up in public, except when I am in the company of cosmetics moment. In a gathering more professional than social, I would do so.Kathy Peiss, a history professor at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst says that nose-powdering in the office was an occasion for outrage in 1920's and 30's. Deploring the practice as a waste of company time, trade journals advises managers to discourage it among workers. Peiss theorizes that it was female's making up in what has been an all-male field that disturb some gentlemen.Peiss tells me that after the 30's , pulling out a make-up case was no longer an issue. It became an accepted practice. I asked if she feels free to apply lipstick at a professional lunch herself. Sounding mildly shocked, she says she would save that for the privacy of her car afterward. Why? Because it would be \"a gesture of inappropriate feminity .\" One guess is that most professional women feel this way.
