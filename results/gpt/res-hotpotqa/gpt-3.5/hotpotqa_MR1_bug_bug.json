There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905. In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan. AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building. In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races. It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad ' The Union Connecting'. Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations. Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout. During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces. Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled. The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort. The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort. As members returned after the War a new location was searched for. This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ. They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time. The space? Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City. Here the layout was built. It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa. It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap. During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey.Clinton is a city in Big Stone County, Minnesota, United States.

It was created in 2000 as part of a bi-state initiative between the Missouri Department of Transportation and the Kansas Department of Transportation to provide this system for the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, which is in both Missouri and Kansas (the anchor city of Kansas City is in Missouri). The project's cost was $43 million. Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost. KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost. The system employs a system of electronic boards placed on major highways throughout the metropolitan area that display traffic information whenever information needs to be displayed (due to an accident, lane closure, highway closure etc.), and the system also has cameras on those billboards to automatically detect traffic problems. While the system has extensive coverage of highways in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area it still has much more to cover. Since it would be too expensive to cover all the major highways in the Kansas City metro (which has more miles of highway per person than any other metropolitan area in the United States), studies were conducted to determine which highways or segments of highways have priority due to higher accident rates. Since the project's beginning, it has expanded greatly, and will continue to expand. Future plans are to extend coverage to I-635 and cover I-435 even more (especially in the northern areas of the metro) as well as other major city highways.

brands of one or more types of consumer electronics devices. Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote. Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with. For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions.In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance. For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.The Apple Remote is a remote control device released in or after October 2005 by Apple Inc. for use with a number of its products which use infrared capabilities. The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers. The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism. It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation. Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive.The Siri Remote is a remote control device released in tandem with the 4th Generation Apple TV at an Apple Keynote Address by CEO Tim Cook on October 26, 2015 by Apple Inc. The Remote is designed specifically to work with the always-on Siri capable Apple TV. The device is a successor of the original Apple Remote. It is also compatible with the Apple TV 4K.NetSupport Manager is a Windows-centric cross-platform remote control software, allowing remote screen control and systems management from a Windows or Windows Mobile device of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris and Mobile devices. It was first released for DOS only networks in 1989. It supports thumbnail display of unlimited remote systems (since version 10), and allows navigation between remote systems in a manner similar to a KVM switch. Functionality includes file transfers, chat, and hardware/software inventory including software updates. Fewer features are supported for Linux and Mac clients. In 2012 NetSupport introduced new software versions allowing Remote Control from iOS and Android tablets and smartphones as well as a new Mac OS Control. Version 12 was released in October 2013, which extended platform support to include ChromeOS clients. Mobile Remote Control from iOS and Android was also extended with additional capabilities. All versions of NetSupport Manager require the pre-installation of the software on both the local (Control) and remote (Client) computers/devices prior to use.Front Row is a discontinued media center software application for Apple's Macintosh computers and Apple TV for navigating and viewing video, photos, podcasts, and music from a computer, optical disc, or the Internet through a 10-foot user interface (similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi). The software relies on iTunes and iPhoto and is controlled by an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys. The first version was released October 2005, with two major revisions since. Front Row was removed and discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7.Apple Watch (stylized as uf8ffWATCH) is a line of smartwatches developed, designed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services. The original generation of the device was available in four variants: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s, and Apple Watch Edition; each distinguished by different combinations of cases and first- or third-party interchangeable bands. Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting. It is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Announced by Apple CEO Tim Cook in September 2014, the device was released in April 24, 2015. The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the supply of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year. The second generation of Apple Watch, released in September 2016, includes two tiers: Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Series 1, which includes the S1P chip, but is otherwise identical to the original. The Series 3 was announced at a presentation at Apple Park on September 12, 2017 and was released on September 22, 2017.MacScan is an anti-malware utility for Apple's Mac OS X developed by SecureMac. It is aimed at removing malware (including spyware, Trojan horses, keystroke loggers, and tracking cookies). It was the first anti-spyware program released for Mac OS X. In addition, the application scans for remote administration programs, like Apple Remote Desktop, allowing users to verify that such programs are installed only with their authorization.Trainmaster Command (TMCC) is Lionel's electronic control system for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains that mainly ran from 1994 to 2006. Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry's open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains. It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives and Lionel Legacy engines as well as LionChief and LionChief Plus equipped locomotives. The latter require a dedicated remote controller. MTH Corporation's DCS controller can be configured to control TMCC locomotives, and all four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief/LionChief+ and DCS) can be operated on the same track simultaneously. Each simply requires a constant track voltage (18 volts). TMCC/Legacy 'broadcasts' it's signal to the antenna on the locomotives which listen for signals that first identify the particular locomotive by number and then it issues given commands as to speed, direction, sounds, lighting and other features. DCS performs similar functions but transmits a carrier over the rails which are picked up through the locomotive's electrical pickup contacts. While TMCC/Legacy and DCS remote controls relay operator commands to a device that transmits them to the train (Command Base or Track Interface Unit), LionChief/LionChief+ also issue remote control commands but the remote and locomotive are married and each locomotive requires a separate remote control. This system requires no additional wiring as the control is directly 'narrowcast' to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener functions. In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that will learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, simplifying the operation of multiple trains.Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) is a Macintosh application produced by Apple Inc., first released on March 14, 2002, that replaced a similar product called 'Apple Network Assistant'. Aimed at computer administrators responsible for large numbers of computers and teachers who need to assist individuals or perform group demonstrations, Apple Remote Desktop allows users to remotely control or monitor other computers over a network.", "modContext": "A universal remote is a device that can control multiple brands of consumer electronics devices.The manufacturer of low-end

It is a network of underground tunnels and caverns, as well as an extensive woodland. Information in the St. Helens local history archives states that sandstone quarrying began here as early as 1730. As the quarry expanded, the cost of purchasing land to open cast mine it increased, so it was decided to opt for a different method. Instead of quarrying out the stone, they would mine it out, following a seam of stone until it ran out. This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels and shafts we see today. Rainford Delph is listed as a Colliery by 1854, under the ownership of Charles Howarth or Yorkshire Charlie as he was known locally by 1880. Mining finally ceased and the woods and caverns were used as a game reserve by the Earl of Derby until 1939, when they became a storage facility for ammunition for the anti-aircraft position at Crank. After the war, the caverns ceased use as a game reserve. Today, Crank Caverns are not officially open to the public and due to their increasing instability, attempts have been made to close access to the caverns and tunnels themselves. Despite this, the site is still physically accessible from a nearby public footpath and is still a draw for generations of curious locals who wish to explore, many having heard the numerous local myths and legends from an early age.Arena of Khazan is a 1979 role-playing game adventure for 'Tunnels & Trolls' published by Flying Buffalo.Crusaders of Khazan is a computer adaptation of the tabletop role-playing game 'Tunnels and Trolls', developed and published by New World Computing in 1990 for the PC, FM Towns, PC-88 and PC-98.

Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier. There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier. It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry. These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.The Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog of the smooth-haired terrier type.A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants. These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier. These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners. Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier.The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog. It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail. The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton.The Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0439, \u0422\u043e\u0439\u0447\u0438\u043a ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier. There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat. The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier. Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the 'Terrier' was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010. The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia.The viol , viola da gamba ] , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings. Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly. Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings. Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods. Early ancestors include the Arabic 'rebab' and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian 'viole' and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish 'vihuela', a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone).The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds. The type originated in Scotland and Northern England. The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout. Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types. Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the AKC has a breed they call 'Collie', in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports. They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity.The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland. The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie. It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes. Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.The Toy Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog, categorized as a terrier. The breed was bred down in size in North America from the Manchester Terrier, and is placed in the Toy Group by the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club (the Manchester Terrier is placed in the Terrier Group.) Neither the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale nor The Kennel Club recognize a Toy variety of the Manchester Terrier.Florence Nagle (26 October 1894xa0\u2013 30 October 1988) was a trainer and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of pedigree dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, and went on to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters.", "modContext": "A hunting terrier commonly known as the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is small to medium in size.The lower-set has a shorter, more muscular and bone density than the American Rat Terrier.A variety of breeds, including the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier have a shared history and are often closely related to the American Rat Terriers, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Territers.The Rat Terrier lineage is believed to have originated from terriers or other dogs that were introduced by early English and working-class immigrants.The breed was predominantly a farm, hunting, and utility dog, with minimal breeding efforts aside from breeding dogs with mutually beneficial traits to produce work-oriented dogs.People are said to have interbreede doggies, such as the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier.It is likely that the early Ratting Terriers were bred with Beagle or Beal cross-breed dogs to enhance their scent and other traits.The modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's exceptional intelligence, sharp sense of smell, and prey drive are a result of their combination of traits from various breeds.Despite being indifferent with strangers, they are loyal companions who enjoy being around their owners and taking care of them.The smooth-haired terrier breed is also known as the Manchester Terrier.A Feist is a small hunting dog that originated from the terriers that were brought to the United States by English miners and working-class immigrants.It is likely that the terriers comprised of hybrids between Smooth Fox Terriers, Manchester Terrier, and English White Terrierra.Ratters were the animals that these dogs were used to, and their owners took pleasure in using them as a means of profiting by killing rats.The Whippets or Italian Greyhounds have been crossed with some dogs, which has given them a wider range of abilities than the original Rat Terrier breed.The English Setter is a type of dog that is medium in size.The red Irish Setters, the Irish Red and White Settler, and the black-and-tan Gordon Setter are all members of the same setter family.The white body coat, which is mostly of the medium length, has long silk fringes on the back of each leg, belly, and tail.The coat has flecks of color, and the different hues are known as belton.The Russian Toy Terrier, also known as the Russkiy Toyer, \u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u043e, and Russia-based ToYchik, is a small breed of dog that was originally developed in Russia from the Manchester Terriers.Both smooth and long coats are present in the breed.The Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier and the Russian Toxin, which was previously referred to as smooth-coated tiger, were both short-lived.In 1988, both animals were rebranded as Russian Toy Terriers, but the 'Terrier' was removed from the name after being added to the official list of breeds registered with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 2006. The breed has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008 and is now permitted to participate in AKC companion events since 2010.The two varieties' first official breed standard was formulated in Russia in 1966.The viol, also known as the 'viola da gamba', is a collection of instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes that can be adjusted to change the tension on the strings.The viol's gut flanges are commonly tied onto the fingerboard near the neck to facilitate clean string stopping for the performer.Frets enhance the intonation consistency and give the stopped notes a more harmonious tone that matches the open strings.The Renaissance and Baroque periods (1600-1750) marked the peak of Viols in Spain, which emerged in the mid to late 15th century.The Arabic 'rebab' and medieval European vielle were among the first of many to emerge, but there are also potential ancestral origins such as the Venetian 'viole' or the Spanish 'vihuela,' which is a 6-course plucked instrument tuned similarly to lute (and modern day viol) and has contrasting characteristics with the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone).The collie is a herding dog that belongs to several landraces and standardised breeds.Scotland and Northern England were the birthplace of the type.A collie has a pointed snout and is of medium size with fairly light build.Several varieties display a distinct white border on the shoulders.Collies exhibit a highly active and agile behavior, with herding being their typical behavior.Many breeds of dogs, including collie, have spread throughout the world (especially Australia and North America), resulting in many varieties, some with a blend of other dog types.Certain collie breeds have managed to sustain in their traditional roles as working dogs, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or used for dog sports due to their exceptional agility, stamina, and ability to train quickly.Although the AKC refers to their breed as 'Collie', they are actually a type of herding dog that includes various landraces and formal breeds.Show dogs are typically markedly dissimilar to those that were bred for herding trials or dog sports.Their agility, stamina, trainability, and sagacity are typically exceptional.A breed of dog known as the Scotch Collie originated in the highlands of Scotland.The Rough and Smooth Collie breeds were present in the same litter.Many people believe that it is the offspring of various ancient herding dogs, some of which may have originated from the Roman period and could include Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dog's like their Celts or Viking counterparts.The Gordon and Irish Setters are among the other forefathers.The Toy Manchester Terrier is a type of dog that falls into the terrier classification.In North America, the breed was bred from the Manchester Terrier and is now part of the Toy Group by the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kenneling Club.The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and The Kennel Club do not acknowledge the existence of any Manchester Terrier toys.Florence Nagle, who specialized in racehorses training and breeding, as well as dog breeders and feminists, died on October 26, 1894 at the age of 30.Nagle obtained her initial Irish Wolfhound in 1913 and subsequently acquired orbred twenty-one United Kingdom Champions.Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle.Her successful field trials with Irish Setters from the 1920s to the mid-1960s resulted in eighteen Field Trial Champions.One of the Irish Setters from Nagle was the lineage of this male dog, which played a crucial role in the 1970s revival of breeds like Irish Red and White Setter.",

recordings, primarily by American bands. This box set is similar to the earlier 'Pebbles Box' (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc. Supposedly, 'the Trash Box' collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records). However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on 'Pebbles, Volume 4' have been eschewed entirely. Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the 'Pebbles Box'. Although most of the recordings on 'the Trash Box' were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series. Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit 'I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)' by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) \u2013 which is also included in the 'Pebbles Box' \u2013 in place of the much rarer 'Wine Wine Wine' by Bobby Fuller that appears on 'Pebbles, Volume 2'.Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003. At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format. This box set, and the companion release 'Rancho Texicano', were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from 'ZZ Top's First Album', 'Rio Grande Mud', and 'Tejas', aside from 1977's 'The Best of ZZ Top' which features two tracks from 'Rio Grande Mud' and one track from 'First Album'. 'Tres Hombres' and 'Fandango!' were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes.Back to Mono (1958\u20131969) is a box set (4 compact discs or 5 vinyl LPs) compilation of the recorded work of record producer Phil Spector, through the 1960s, released in 1991 by ABKCO as #7118-2. The first track, 'To Know Him Is to Love Him,' released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears. Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, 'The First Tycoon of Teen.' The package also contained a small, round, red 'Back to Mono' pin.Live in Japan is a four-disc box set by American saxophonist John Coltrane and his last group, featuring the quintet of Coltrane, his wife/pianist Alice, saxophonist/bass clarinetist Pharoah Sanders, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Rashied Ali. The 4-CD set compiles all the music issued as three albums in the seventies by Impulse!; 'Concert In Japan' (1973, US 2-LP, electronically processed for compatible quadrophonic/stereo), 'Coltrane In Japan' (1974, Japan 3-LP (side six is blank), mono) and 'Second Night In Tokyo' (1976, Japan 3-LP (side six contains an interview, mono). (Some of this material was also reissued as two 2-LP sets in 1980 by MCA under the titles 'Coltrane In Tokyo Vol. 1' and 'Coltrane In Tokyo Vol. 2') The first CD issues were by Impulse! Japan as two 2-CD sets: 'Live In Japan Vol. 1' (same as 'Coltrane In Japan') and 'Live In Japan Vol. 2' (same as 'Second Night In Tokyo'). The US 4-CD edition includes both of these volumes, with identical mastering from the original mono tapes. The side six interview from 'Second Night In Tokyo' has never been reissued on any CD edition.Nashville Rebel is a box set by Waylon Jennings, released on RCA Records through Legacy Recordings in 2006. According to Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, it is ''the first comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembled', comprising ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with selections from the majority of the singer's recording career. The first track of the box set is the Buddy Holly-produced 'Jole Blon,' released in 1958, while the last is 'I Do Believe,' a song produced by Don Was that was included on The Highwaymen's 1995 release, 'The Road Goes on Forever'. The other material on the box set covers Jennings' career chronologically, with songs ranging from his years on RCA's roster to later compositions from his short-lived stay at Epic Records; it ignores, however, the tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels. The majority of the singer's charting singles are included in the package, as are collaborations such as 'Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys' with Willie Nelson and 'Highwayman' with The Highwaymen. A notable addition is the previously unreleased 'The Greatest Cowboy of Them All,' a 1978 duet with Johnny Cash which was later recorded by Cash alone for 'A Believer Sings the Truth' (1979) and 'The Mystery of Life' (1991); two others, 'It's Sure Been Fun' and 'People in Dallas Got Hair,' had never been released in the United States. 'Nashville Rebel' was released on four CDs, with a 140-page booklet and liner notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye.Radiohead Box Set is a box set of the first six studio albums and one live album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 10 December 2007. The box set is available as a seven CD box set, a digital download and a 4GB USB Stick. The box set peaked at #95 in Canada's album charts.Mono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album 'Past Masters'. 'Mono Masters' was originally a two-CD set included as part of 'The Beatles in Mono' box set. The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version). As a result, the track listing for 'Mono Masters' differs from 'Past Masters' on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix ('Old Brown Shoe', 'The Ballad of John and Yoko' and 'Let It Be'), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes. Tracks 9\u201312 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7' mono 'Yellow Submarine' EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered. Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or 'fold-down', of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased. 'Get Back' (with B-side 'Don't Let Me Down') was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format. It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo. Thus, the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release.Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 is a double album released by Atlantic Records on 21 September 1993. This box set features the rest of the English rock band Led Zeppelin's catalogue not included in the 1990 4-CD box set 'Led Zeppelin', all digitally remastered, including the previously unreleased studio track 'Baby Come On Home'. A 54-page booklet was also included with the release. Between this box set and the 4-CD box set every track from the band's nine studio albums are featured along with two BBC live recordings; the band's only non-LP b-side; and one studio outtake.'To Know Him Is to Love Him' is a song written by Phil Spector, inspired by words on his father's tombstone, 'To Know Him Was To Love Him.' It was first recorded by the only vocal group of which he was a member, the Teddy Bears. Their recording spent three weeks at No. 1 on the 'Billboard' Hot 100 singles chart in 1958, while reaching No. 2 on UK's 'New Musical Express' chart. Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton later had hits with the song, with its title and lyrics changed to 'To Know You Is to Love You'. In 1987, the song was resurrected by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris, whose 'Trio' recording topped the U.S. country singles charts. The song is in 12/8 time.The Doors: Vinyl Box Set is the seventh box set for the rock band The Doors. It is a 7 record set of the original 6 Doors albums, remastered in stereo from the original analogue tapes with a mono version of the debut album. Artwork, packaging, and inner sleeves are replicas of the originals from 1967-1971. The box set was originally planned to be released in October 2007, but was delayed due to a problem with the vinyl, as well as other problems in the production of the box set. The delay ran until February 2008. Reasons for the delay included faulty test pressings, inferiority of the L.A. Woman artwork, and bad compounds in the vinyl that was used first, which caused a search for a new source of virgin vinyl.", "modContext": "A collection of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, mostly by American bands, is presented in a 5-CD box set named Trash Box.Almost all the recordings in this box set are in the same order as the earlier 'Pebbles Box' and there are many bonus tracks at the end of each disc.The first five volumes of the Pebbles series' CDs are supposedly collected by 'the Trash Box'.e.AIP Records issued the CDs, separate from the 4 earlier releases by ESD Records.Although not identically, the CD reissues of these five volumes often feature distinct songs that differ from their original Pebbles LPs and later Pemba CDs.The surf rock icons on 'Pebbles, Volume 4' have been completely excluded.The box set has 109 songs (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) in comparison to the 'Pebbles Box' and individual CDs, which have only 72 tracks.The recordings in 'the Trash Box' were primarily released on one of the individual Pebbles albums, but some of them have not been included in any other edition of this series.In 'Pebbles, Volume 2', the Bobby Fuller Four's 'I Fought to Law (but the Law Won)' was included in addition to the much rarer 'Wine Wine Wine' by Bobby Fulker, which is a different song.ZZ Top, an American blues-rock band, released their box set Chrome, Smoke & BBQ in 2003.By using the original mixes for all five of the band's first five albums on CD, this box set was a significant milestone at the time of its release.The only CD released separately that featured original mixes from 'ZZ Top's First Album', 'Rio Grande Mud', and 'Tejas' were this box set and the companion release 'Los Animados de Naranjo' (w/W Garage Door), as well as two tracks from both albums.'Tres Hombres' and 'Fandango!'The original mixes of the ZZ Top studio albums were reissued in 2006, and Warner Brothers released the first ten CD box sets ('The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990') in 2013, which features all original versions.A compilation of Phil Spector's recorded work from 1958 to 1969, as well as 4 compact discs and 5 vinyl LPs, was released by ABKCO in 1991 under the name of Back to Mono (1958-1969).The Teddy Bears' first track, 'To Know Him Is to Love Him,' was released in 1958 and features Spector's performance.A box originally made of vinyl albums contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and re-issued copies of Tom Wolfe's essay on Spector, 'The First Tycoon of Teen.'The package contained a 'Back to Mono' pin, which was small, round, and red.John Coltrane's last group, the quintet, was joined by his wife/pianist Alice, saxophonist/bass clarinetist Pharoah Sanders, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Rashied Ali in Live in Japan.All three seventies music albums released by Impulse are compiled into a 4-CD collection!It follows that;In 1973, the US 2-LP version was 'Concert In Japan,' which was electronically processed for compatible quadrophonic/stereo.MCA reissued two 2-LP sets of some of the material in 1980, which were named 'Coltrane In Tokyo Vol..''1' and 'Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.Impulse was the first to release a CD!'In Japan, two 2-CD compilations named 'Live In Japan Vol.''1' (also known as 'Coltrane In Japan') and 'Live in Japan Vol.'2' (similar to the title 'Second Night In Tokyo').The US 4-CD version of both volumes contains the same mastering as the original mono tapes.The side six interview from 'Second Night In Tokyo' has not been included in any CD compilation.In 2006, Waylon Jennings released a box set called Nashville Rebel on RCA Records through Legacy Recordings.Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine declares that the retrospective is the first of its kind, featuring a comprehensive list of ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with contributions from most of Jennings' recording career.'Jole Blon,' produced by Buddy Holly, is the first track in the set, while the last track on the box set is 'I Do Believe,' a song created by Don Was and featured on The Highwaymen's 1995 album 'The Road Goes on Forever'.The rest of the box set contains songs that cover Jennings' career, ranging from early days at RCA to his brief stint with Epic Records;The tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels are not taken into account.Included in the package are most of the singer's chart-topping singles, as well as joint releases like 'Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys' with Willie Nelson and 'Highwayman' featuring The Highwaymen.'The Greatest Cowboy of Them All,' a duet with Johnny Cash that was not previously released, is another noteworthy addition.

It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city. The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds. After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead. The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations. A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials\u2014the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England. Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities\u2014the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922. The committee quickly raised \u00a310,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial. The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community. The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church. Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ.The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England. Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location. This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1884 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880. It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion.The Reading Post (until 2009, the Reading Evening Post), was an English local newspaper covering Reading, Berkshire and surrounding areas. The title page of the paper featured the Maiwand Lion, a famous local landmark at Forbury Gardens. The paper was most recently published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd., a division of Trinity Mirror plc.Spalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England. It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war. She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross. The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council. When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested. After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.The Forbury Hotel (formerly Shire Hall) is a grade II listed hotel in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire. It is situated on the southern side of Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town centre.St James's Church is a Roman Catholic church situated in the centre of the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.

The Kargil national flag was raised to commemorate the 13th anniversary of India's victory in World War I.One of Lutyens' fifteen War Crosses was designed to the same standard, and another was created as a civic memorial.A cloister at Exeter Cathedral dedicated to the dead was initially planned as the county's war memorial, but it was abandoned due to insufficient funding.The Devon County War Memorial Committee considered several options and decided to enlist Lutyens to design a War Cross.After scouting multiple sites, the committee ultimately chose to place the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral.The two projects involving the creation of a war memorial for Exeter were discussed at the same time, but due to insufficient coordination, they were divided into two separate memorials: the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.The Manchester Cenotaph, situated in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England, was created by Sir Edwin Lutyens as a memorial to the First World War, with provisions for later battles.Manchester's war memorial was not commissioned until 1922, which was a long time coming for the city council to carry out such large-scale construction projects.The committee raised \u00a310,000 in a short amount of time, but the decision to position the monument in that location was contentious.The artistic community of the city was against the proposed site in Albert Square, which would require the removal and relocation of several statues.The council opted for St Peter's Square over Piccadilly Gardens, which was already an ideal location for development.The attempt to relocate the cross failed, resulting in the construction of the war memorial with the original cross intact.Sir Edwin Lutyens was the designer of the York City War Memorial, which is situated in the northern part of England.The idea of honoring York's war dead was first proposed in 1919, but it became a contentious issue.Initially, the discussion revolved around whether a memorial should be classified as an emblem or considered of practical importance.A public meeting in January 1920 led to the decision to pursue a monument instead of other practical proposals.The city engineer created a cost estimate, and the war memorial committee hired Lutyens, who had been recently instructed by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to create their own war monument, which would also be located in York.Lutyens' initial design was given the green light, but there was controversy surrounding plans for memorials in the city and the NER.Local residents grew concerned that the planned memorials did not conform to the original design of York, particularly since they were situated near the city walls, and that this memorial would be more prominent than the NER's.Due to persistent public opposition, the committee resorted to abandoning the proposed site and instead choosing to build a new one on Leeman Road outside the walls. Lutyens proposed modifying the original design to include inscriptions on the War Cross and Stone of Remembrance.Due to insufficient funds, the cross was the only exception.A public park in Reading's English county of Berkshire, the Forbury Gardens contains a sculpture and memorial to war, including the Maiwand Lion.In 1884, a statue was constructed to honor the Battle of Maiwand, where 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot lost their lives in Afghanistan during World War II between 1878 and 1880.In the local area, it is sometimes called the Forbury Lion.The Reading Post, which was originally known as the Reading Evening Post until 2009, was a local English newspaper that covered Reading, Berkshire and its environs.The Maiwand Lion, a well-known local landmark at Forbury Gardens, was featured on the paper's title page.The latest publisher of the paper is Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd.A subsidiary of Trinity Mirror plc.Spalding War Memorial, a memorial to the First World War, is situated in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced), which is located in Spalldorp, in eastern England.Sir Edwin Lutyens was the architect responsible for designing it.In January 1918, Barbara McLaren came up with the idea of a memorial to Spalding's fallen soldiers, after her husband and the town' MP, Francis McLarty, died in ill-fated flying accident during World War I.Lutyens was hired by her through a family connection, and the architect designed he would build an enormous memorial cloister around pond with crucifix in the middle.The formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, owned by the local district council, were designated as the site for the memorial's construction.McLaren's proposal to the council caused a lot of controversy in the community, leading to suggestions of other options.A public meeting and a vote in 1919 led to the choice of using alterations to McLaren's proposal, which was then preferred over reworking it into wing-scale designs.The Forbury Hotel, which was once known as Shire Hall, is a hotel with grade II listed status located in Reading, England.It is located on the southern side of Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town centre.The centre of Reading in the English county of Berkshire is where St James's Church, a Roman Catholic church, can be found.The remains of Reading Abbey are situated between Forbury Gardens and Reading Gaol, in close proximity to the site.A public park named Forbury Gardens can be found in Reading, which is located in the English county of Berkshire.The park is situated on the spot where Reading Abbey's outer court was located, which was in front of the Abbey Church.The Forbury was the previous name of the site, and one of its roads paralleling the gardens is still referred to as The Fort.Until the 19th century, the site hosted three annual fairs.", "question": "when did the english local newspaper, featuring the sculpture and war memorial in the forbury gardens, change names?", "groundTruth": "cam newton", "answer": "the english local newspaper changed names in 2009", "modAnswer": "the english local newspaper changed names in 2009", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[34, 0.5354094505310059], [22, 0.4744415283203125], [50, 0.46439576148986816], [11, 0.4484121799468994], [30, 0.4470297694206238], [16, 0.435261070728302], [48, 0.4335278272628784], [37, 0.4334579408168793], [14, 0.4256022870540619], [15, 0.41666242480278015], [44, 0.4080319106578827], [19, 0.40487903356552124], [41, 0.40447163581848145], [27, 0.40408796072006226], [21, 0.3977658152580261], [45, 0.39269956946372986], [47, 0.368185430765152], [9, 0.3662342429161072], [10, 0.3525238335132599], [39, 0.3511192798614502], [32, 0.3503081202507019], [13, 0.32591578364372253], [18, 0.32217809557914734], [12, 0.32155853509902954], [24, 0.3183712959289551], [28, 0.31204208731651306], [26, 0.31011462211608887], [40, 0.3045004606246948], [25, 0.3002309799194336], [5, 0.29967260360717773], [23, 0.2992963194847107], [17, 0.28447383642196655], [31, 0.2840477526187897], [33, 0.28400444984436035], [35, 0.27960097789764404], [43, 0.260851114988327], [49, 0.2543933391571045], [38, 0.24949286878108978], [20, 0.22554117441177368], [51, 0.22338148951530457], [7, 0.21629662811756134], [46, 0.21412737667560577], [3, 0.2055090367794037], [6, 0.1465139091014862], [8, 0.12785208225250244], [1, 0.12654562294483185], [42, 0.10222101956605911], [36, 0.08776726573705673], [0, 0.07102890312671661], [29, 0.06909041106700897], [4, 0.06681758910417557], [2, 0.015048136003315449]]}, {"test case number": 40, "context": "Lord of Islay was a thirteenth- and fourteenth-century title borne by the chiefs of Clann Domhnaill before they assumed the title 'Lord of the Isles' in the late fourteenth century.

The designation 'of Islay' was frequently used by these lords and later members of the clan.Aonghus M\u00f3r mac Domhnaill (died c.1293) was a leading figure in the thirteenth-century kingdoms of the Isles and Scotland. He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle. Aonghus M\u00f3r appears to have succeeded his father in the mid part of the thirteenth century. At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown. Aonghus M\u00f3r's first certain appearance in the historical record seems to evince his involvement in aiding native Irish kindreds against the consolidation of Anglo-Irish authority in the north-west Ireland. Such cooperation could have been undertaken in the context of overseas kindreds like Clann Domhnaill constructing Irish alliances to gain assistance against Scottish encroachment.Forests in Himachal Pradesh currently cover an area of nearly 37,691 sqkm , which is about 38.3% of the total land area of the state.

It is the most widely spoken and (co-) official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein. It is also one of the three official languages of Luxembourg. The languages which are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch: Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, Low German/Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. German is the second most widely spoken Germanic language, after English.English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global 'lingua franca'. Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is closely related to the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and Romance languages, particularly French.Proto-Norse (also called Proto-Scandinavian, Primitive Norse, Proto-Nordic, Ancient Nordic, Ancient Scandinavian, Old Nordic, Old Scandinavian, Proto-North Germanic, North Proto-Germanic or Common Scandinavian) was an Indo-European language spoken in Scandinavia that is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic in the first centuries CE. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the oldest Scandinavian Elder Futhark inscriptions, spoken around from the 2nd to 8th centuries (corresponding to the late Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age). It evolved into the dialects of Old Norse at the beginning of the Viking Age in about 800, which later themselves evolved into modern North Germanic languages.Dutch (xa0xa0 ) is a West Germanic language that is spoken by around 24 million people as a first language\u2014including the population of the Netherlands and about sixty percent that of Belgium\u2014and by another 5 million as a second language. It is the third most widely spoken Germanic language, after English and German.Old Frisian is a West Germanic language spoken between the 8th and 16th centuries in the area between the Rhine and Weser on the European North Sea coast. The Frisian settlers on the coast of South Jutland (today's Northern Friesland) also spoke Old Frisian but no medieval texts of this area are known. The language of the earlier inhabitants of the region between the Zuiderzee and Ems River (the Frisians mentioned by Tacitus) is attested in only a few personal names and place-names. Old Frisian evolved into Middle Frisian, spoken from the 16th to the 19th century.Afrikaans ( ) is a West Germanic language spoken in South Africa, Namibia and, to a lesser extent, Botswana and Zimbabwe. It evolved from the Dutch vernacular of South Holland (Hollandic dialect) spoken by the mainly Dutch settlers of what is now South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century. Hence, it is a daughter language of Dutch, and was previously referred to as 'Cape Dutch' (a term also used to refer collectively to the early Cape settlers) or 'kitchen Dutch' (a derogatory term used to refer to Afrikaans in its earlier days). However, it is also variously described as a creole or as a partially creolised language. The term is ultimately derived from Dutch 'Afrikaans-Hollands ' meaning 'African Dutch'. It is the first language of most of the Afrikaners and Coloureds of Southern Africa.Leer is a town in the district of Leer, the northwestern part of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated on the river Leda, a tributary of the river Ems, near the border with the Netherlands.Suorva or Suorvadammen (the Suorva Dam) is a small settlement situated at the southern parts of Akkajaure, in Stora Sj\u00f6fallet National Park, Sweden. The settlement can be reached by car (and bus, from G\u00e4llivare). It consists of a few houses and a dam operated by Vattenfall, which regulates the flow to the hydroelectric plant in Vietas located about 5 kilometers downstream. The road over the dam is normally open for hikers (not cars) and makes for a possible route into the northern parts of Sarek National Park which does not require using a boat.Old Saxon, also known as Old Low German, was a Germanic language and the earliest recorded form of Low German (spoken nowadays in Northern Germany, the northeastern Netherlands, southern Denmark, the Americas and parts of Eastern Europe). It is a West Germanic language, closely related to the Anglo-Frisian languages. It has been documented from the 8th century until the 12th century, when it gradually evolved into Middle Low German. It was spoken throughout modern northwestern Germany, primarily in the coastal regions and in the eastern Netherlands by Saxons, a Germanic tribe who inhabited the region of Saxony. It partially shares Anglo-Frisian's (Old Frisian, Old English) Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law which sets it apart from Low Franconian and Irminonic languages, such as Dutch, Luxembourgish and German.The Leda is a river in north-western Germany in the state of Lower Saxony. It is a right tributary of the Ems and originates at the confluence of the Sagter Ems and the Soeste (Dreyschloot) near the town of Bar\u00dfel. The Leda flows into the Ems near the town of Leer. On the southern bank of the Leda, in the 'Overledingen Land' (Overledingen='country over the Leda'), opposite Leer, lies the small settlement of Kloster Muhde ('Muhde' from the Old Frisian 'mutha' meaning '(river) mouth').

Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: 'How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.''See Yourself' is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album 'Thirty Three & 1/3'. Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD. McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity. In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions. Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks 'Within You Without You' and 'All You Need Is Love'.English musician Syd Barrett recorded many songs during his short career as a musician. One of the founding members of English rock band Pink Floyd, he was the dominant force of the band in their early years, writing most of the material found on their first album, 'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn', contributing to their second one, 'A Saucerful of Secrets', and recording several unreleased songs with the band. Due to increasing mental illness, Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 and was subsequently replaced by guitarist David Gilmour. After Pink Floyd, Barrett would record two solo albums, both released in 1970, before Barrett left the music business entirely in 1972.No Plan is an extended play, comprising songs written and recorded by English musician David Bowie, released posthumously on 8 January 2017. The release coincided with what would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, almost a year after his death. 'No Plan' compiles the original songs written for Bowie's Broadway musical, 'Lazarus', including the titular 'Lazarus', 'No Plan', 'Killing a Little Time', and 'When I Met You'. The songs were first recorded by the cast of the musical as part of its official soundtrack. The recordings featured on 'No Plan' come from the sessions for Bowie's twenty-fifth and final studio album 'Blackstar', with 'Lazarus' appearing as the third track on the album. Upon release, 'No Plan' debuted at #138 on the 'Billboard' 200. The music video for the title track was also released in accompaniment with the EP. It was directed by Tom Hingston.'We Laughed' is a three-track single by English musician Billy Bragg as part of the Rosetta Life project. The single was released in 2005 in the UK and peaked at No. 11. It also reached No. 38 in Ireland in 2006. For the three songs on the single, Bragg collaborated with three patients of Trimar Hospice in Weymouth, who each wrote lyrics based on their illness and feelings. The songs were produced by English guitarist Robbie McIntosh.'Who Can See It' is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1973 album 'Living in the Material World'. The lyrics reflect Harrison's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles' legacy, three years after the group's break-up, and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band's unprecedented popularity. Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish, following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album 'All Things Must Pass' and his 1971\u201372 Bangladesh aid project. The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between 'Living in the Material World' and John Lennon's primal therapy-inspired 1970 release, 'Plastic Ono Band'.5:55 is the second album by French musician and actress Charlotte Gainsbourg. It is also her first album release in twenty years. Charlotte collaborated on the album with French duo Air, English musician Jarvis Cocker, and Irish singer-songwriter Neil Hannon, as well as Radiohead's main producer Nigel Godrich. 'The Songs That We Sing' and '5:55' were released as singles. The album went platinum in France, selling over 500,000 copies. In the United States, the album sold a modest 22,000 copies. 'The Songs That We Sing' was #78 on 'Rolling Stone'' s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007.Colin Murray 'Gem' Archer (born 7 December 1966) is an English musician, best known as a member of the English rock bands Oasis, Beady Eye and Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. He is also known for his work with Heavy Stereo. He joined Oasis as rhythm guitarist in November 1999, and handled lead guitar for acoustic songs as well. He also contributed to the writing of some of the band's songs. Oasis broke up in August 2009, but in November 2009, Liam Gallagher announced he was writing new material with Archer as well as other ex-Oasis members minus his brother Noel, under the name Beady Eye. After two albums with Beady Eye, 2011's 'Different Gear, Still Speeding' and 2013's 'BE', the band officially disbanded in October 2014. In 2017, Archer joined Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds as lead guitarist, thus reuniting with former Oasis member Noel Gallagher.'Within You Without You' is a song written by George Harrison and released on the Beatles' 1967 album 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'. It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after 'Love You To', and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September\u2013October 1966. Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle. The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas. Although the song was his only composition on 'Sgt. Pepper', Harrison's endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover.", "modContext": "A

'emptiness' as a fundamental aspect of Jivamukti Yoga.The statement can be put in simple terms, meaning that everything you encounter and do in the world is a result of your perception of it.To change

It is a broad therapeutic concept. It is defined by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society as an evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive intervention for patients with chronic respiratory diseases who are symptomatic and often have decreased daily life activities. In general, pulmonary rehabilitation refers to a series of services that are administered to patients of respiratory disease and their families, typically to attempt to improve the quality of life for the patient. Pulmonary rehabilitation may be carried out in a variety of settings, depending on the patient's needs, and may or may not include pharmacologic intervention.The Journal of Thoracic Disease is a peer-reviewed open access medical journal covering pulmonology. It was established in December 2009 and is published monthly by AME Publishing Company. It is the official journal of the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, and the Society for Thoracic Disease. The editor-in-chief is Zhong Nanshan (Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases). According to the 'Journal Citation Reports', the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 2.365.Yi Guan is a Chinese virologist who, in 2014, was ranked as 11th in the world by Thomson Reuters (now known as Clarivate Analytics) among global researchers in the field of microbiology. His research on the viral respiratory disease SARS allowed the Chinese government to successfully avert the 2004 outbreak of this disease. He is the current Director (China affairs) of the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases University of Hong Kong. In early 2017, Guan warned that the H7N9 influenza virus 'poses the greatest threat to humanity than any other in the past 100 years.'The Irish Thoracic Society (ITS) is the official society for professionals involved in the care of people with chronic or acute respiratory disease in Ireland.

Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China caused an eventual 8,098 cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in 37 countries, with the majority of cases in Hong Kong (9.6% fatality rate) according to the World Health Organization (WHO). No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004.Chronic Respiratory Disease is a quarterly peer-reviewed medical journal that covers research in the field of respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory failure, and obstructive sleep apnea.

It was established in 2004 and is published by SAGE Publications.SARS is severe acute respiratory syndrome, a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus.Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is an upper respiratory or pulmonary infection of cats caused by 'feline herpesvirus 1', of the family 'Herpesviridae'. It is also commonly referred to as feline influenza, feline coryza, and feline pneumonia but, as these terms describe other very distinct collections of respiratory symptoms, they are misnomers for the condition. Viral respiratory diseases in cats can be serious, especially in catteries and kennels. Causing one-half of the respiratory diseases in cats, FVR is the most important of these diseases and is found worldwide. The other important cause of feline respiratory disease is 'feline calicivirus'.Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma. These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma. Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood. These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV). Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age. HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development. In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma. Thus, 'Chlamydia pneumoniae', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae' and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma.", "modContext": "The 2002-04 season of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is presented below in chronological order.The management and health maintenance of individuals with chronic respiratory disease who still display symptoms or experience reduced function, despite standard medical treatment, is often achieved through respiratory rehabilitation.The concept is a generalized form of medicine.The American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society define it as a multidisciplinary, evidence-based intervention for patients with chronic respiratory diseases who exhibit symptoms and experience reduced activities of daily life.The term pulmonary rehabilitation generally refers to a range of services provided to individuals with respiratory disease and their dependents, usually designed to improve the patient's quality of life.Depending on the patient's needs, pulmonary rehabilitation may be performed in various settings, with or without pharmacologic intervention.Pulmonology is the subject of the peer-reviewed medical journal, Journal of Thoracic Disease, that is open to the public.Established in December 2009, it is published monthly by AME Publishing Company.The official medical publication of the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, the Guangzhou Institute of Reproductive Disease (GIU), the First Affiliated Hospital of GuANGzhou Medical University, and the Society for Thoracic Disease is this.Zhong Nanshan, who holds the position of editor-in-chief at the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases.The journal's impact factor was 2 in 2016, as per the 'Journal Citation Reports'.A total of 365 days.Yi Guan, a Chinese virologist, was ranked as the 11th best researcher in the world by Thomson Reuters (now called Clarivate Analytics) in 2014 when compared to other researchers worldwide.By conducting research on the viral respiratory disease SARS, the Chinese government was able to prevent the 2004 outbreak.He currently holds the position of Director (China affairs) at the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases University of Hong Kong.Guan stated in early 2017 that the H7N9 influenza virus represents the most significant danger to humanity in the last 100 years.The official society for professionals caring for people with chronic or acute respiratory disease in Ireland is the Irish Thoracic Society (ITS).The Society's membership comprises of respiratory physicians, internal medicine physicians and other healthcare providers who specialize in or have an interest in respiratory disease and care across Ireland -

The Oku people are the descendants of liberated Africans of Yoruba descent from Southwest Nigeria who were liberated or came to Sierra Leone as settlers in the mid 19th century and formed a distinctive ethnic group The Oku are virtually all Muslims and are known for their conservative muslim population. The British colonial government provided official recognition to the Oku Mohammedan community as a distinctive community in Sierra Leone. Although the Sierra Leone government officially considered the Oku people as members of the Creole ethnic group, many Sierra Leoneans consider the Oku people as a distinctive ethnic group.The Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) is an Irish Catholic fraternal organisation. Members must be Catholic and either born in Ireland or of Irish descent. Its largest membership is now in the United States, where it was founded in New York City in 1836. Its name was adopted by groups of Irish immigrants in the United States, its purpose to act as guards to protect Catholic churches from anti-Catholic forces in the mid-19th century, and to assist Irish Catholic immigrants, especially those who faced discrimination or harsh coal mining working conditions. Many members in the coal mining area of Pennsylvania had a background with the Molly Maguires. It became an important focus of Irish American political activity.The Pinpu tribe peoples, also called the Pepo or Plains tribes, are peoples that mainly settled in the western plains of Taiwan. They led a primitive agricultural life before the mass arrival of Han immigrants. Since the 17th century, they have faced the strong forces from outside, such as the Dutch, the Spanish, and the Han Chinese, and they have failed to resist their fate to be assimilated. By the end of 19th century, most Pingpu tribes had been almost completely Hanised (hanhua), and they have lost their languages and cultures. They have become an invisible ethnic group in a society highly dominated by the Han Chinese. During the period of Japanese rule, Japanese scholars conducted investigations and research on the Plains tribes based on anthropology and ethnology. The present categorization of the Plains tribes has resulted from their thorough study as the following:African Bermudians or Bermudians of African descent are Bermudians whose ancestry lies within the continent of Africa. The population descented from Black Africans, exported to Bermuda as slaves. Some Black Bermudians were Free Blacks who chose to immigrate to the island to work as indentured servants during the 17th century. By the 19th century the Black population surpassed the White population and became Bermuda's largest ethnic group, which was initially classed as being 'Coloured' alongside all other non-white ethnicities of Bermuda. 'Black Bermudian' became a recognised ethnic group in Bermuda in the 20th century, by which time it was the largest ethnic group on the island.People of Irish descent form the largest ethnic group in the city of Philadelphia and its surrounding counties. The Irish have lived in Philadelphia since the pre-American Revolution period. Irishmen had participated in pro-Revolutionary activities in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War. Like many American cities in the 19th century, Philadelphia, which was once a Quaker stronghold, changed dramatically with the influx of European immigrants. The first major influx of Irish came in 1844 from rural areas, spurred by the Irish Famine. Because of the Quakers belief and pledge of religious tolerance, Irish Catholics and Protestants, amongst others, made the city incredibly diverse. Philadelphia at the time had a need for industrial labor, and at the time Philadelphia was becoming a major industrial center in the United States. Irish took industrial positions. In the 1840s and 1850s, anti-Catholic sentiment grew against the Irish, and eventually led up to riots, such as the Philadelphia nativist riots and the Lombard Street riot. Eventually the Irish gained financial and social status in the latter half of the 19th Century and founded institutions during the period.The Shiners' War was a conflict between Irish Catholic immigrants and French Canadians in Bytown from 1835 to 1845. The war started when Peter Aylen, a major Irish timber operator, organized a group of Irishmen to attack other timber operations. This group was known as the 'Shiners.' They attacked French Canadian timber rafts and fought against the French Canadian on the streets of Bytown.Americo-Liberians, or the Congo people in Liberian English, are a Liberian ethnicity of African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and liberated African descent. The sister ethnic group of Americo-Liberians are the Sierra Leone Creole people, who shared similar ancestry and related culture. Americo-Liberians trace their ancestry to free-born and formerly enslaved African Americans who immigrated in the 19th century to become the founders of the state of Liberia. They identified there as Americo Liberians. (Some African Americans, following resettlement in Canada, also participated as founding settlers in Sierra Leone and present-day C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.) Although the terms 'Americo-Liberian' and 'Congo' had distinct definitions in the nineteenth century, the terms 'Americo-Liberian' and 'Congo' are currently interchangeable and refer to an ethnic group composed of the descendants of the various free and ex-slave African American, Caribbean, Recaptive, and Sierra Leone Creoles who settled in Liberia from 1822.People of Irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in Boston, Massachusetts. Once a Puritan stronghold, Boston changed dramatically in the 19th century with the arrival of European immigrants. The Irish dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following the Great Irish Famine. Their arrival transformed Boston from an Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city into one that has become progressively more diverse. The Yankees hired Irish as workers and servants, but there was little social interaction. In the 1840s and 50s, the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant Know-Nothing movement targeted Irish Catholics in Boston. In the 1860s, many Irish immigrants fought for the Union in the American Civil War, and that display of patriotism helped to dispel some of the prejudice against them.French Canadians (also referred to as Franco-Canadians or Canadiens; French: 'Canadien(ne)s fran\u00e7ais(es)' ) are an ethnic group who trace their ancestry to French colonists who settled in Canada from the 17th century onward. Today, French Canadians constitute the main French-speaking population in Canada, accounting for about 22% of the total population.Czechs in Ukraine, often known as Volhynian Czechs (Czech: 'Voly\u0148\u0161t\u00ed \u010ce\u0161i'), are ethnic Czechs or their descendants settled mostly in the Volhynia region of Ukraine, in the second half of the 19th century. Between 1868 and 1880, almost 16,000 Czechs left Austria-Hungary for Tsarist Russia. The reasons for their departure were the difficult living conditions in the Czech lands, and the rumors of prosperity in the Russian realm, where there was a large amount of unused agricultural land. The local government in the region attracted new immigrants with a number of advantages, such as the right to purchase their own land for low prices, and the establishment of manufacturing businesses. Also, they gave the migrants the right to national education, self-government and religious freedom. Immigrants were exempt for 20 years from tax, and exonerated from military duty. The bulk of the Czechs settled in the regions of Volhynia, Zhytomyr, Lutsk and other areas. Some villages were set up in flat meadows, while others were located near existing Ukrainian villages. Local Czech naems for the villages they lived in were formed from the original name of the village, which was supplemented with the word 'Czech' (eg \u010cesk\u00e9 Noviny, \u010cesk\u00fd Mal\u00edn, \u010cesk\u00fd Borat\u00edn, \u010cesk\u00fd Straklov, etc.) Apart from agriculture, Czech immigrants began to engage in other activities, such as industry, trade and crafts. The income for most ethnic Czechs had its foundations in the engineering, breweries, mills, cement plants, etc. In their communities, schools, churches, and libraries were founded, and because of this, cultural and social life flourished. Czech immigrants have made a major contribution to increasing the economic and cultural level in the built-up areas.", "modContext": "The Oku Mohammedans, also referred to as Okus Mohammedan in Sierra

government.Despite being classified as Creole by the government of Sierra Leone, many in the country consider the Oku people to be an exceptional ethnic group.An Irish Catholic fraternal group known as the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) exists.Members are required to be of Irish descent or Catholic origin.Its founding can be traced back to New York City in 1836, and its membership is now the largest in the United States.This organization's name was taken up by Irish immigrants in the United States, with the aim of serving as a protection guard for Catholic churches against anti-Catholic forces during the mid-19th century and to assist Irish Catholic immigrants, particularly those who suffered discrimination or severe working conditions in coal mining.The Molly Maguires had a history of association with numerous members in the coal mining region of Pennsylvania.It became a significant focal point of Irish American political activity.The western plains of Taiwan were primarily settled by the Pinpu tribe peoples, also known as the Pepo or Plains tribes.Prior to the arrival of Han immigrants, their agricultural lifestyle was simple.The Dutch, Spanish, and Han Chinese have been formidable adversaries of theirs since the 17th century, despite their efforts to resist their assimilation.The Pingpu tribes were mostly Hanized (hanhua) by the end of the 19th century, and their languages and cultures were completely replaced.They have become an obscure ethnic group in a society that is heavily influenced by the Han Chinese.Anthropology and ethnology were the primary methodologies employed by Japanese scholars to study the Plains tribes during the Japanese occupation.Following a thorough examination, the Plains tribes are now classified as African Bermudians or Bermoanians of African origin, who have their roots in Africa.The Black Africans' deodorization and slave trade were exported to Bermuda.Indentured servants were among the Free Blacks who migrated to the island during the 17th century.In the 1800s, the Black population surpassed the White population to become Bermuda's largest ethnic group, which was initially considered 'Coloured' when compared to all other non-white groups in the island.By the 20th century, Bermuda had identified 'Black Bermudian', an ethnic group that was already the largest in terms of population on the island.The Irish population is the most populous ethnic group in Philadelphia and its surrounding counties.Since the time before the American Revolution, Philadelphia has been a residence of the Irish.Pro-Revolutionary movements in Philadelphia were carried out by Irishmen during the Revolutionary War.Philadelphia, like many American cities in the 19th century, was once a Quaker stronghold but underwent significant changes due to European immigration.The Irish Famine in 1844 caused the first significant migration of Irish people from rural areas.The Quaker faith and commitment to religious tolerance resulted in the emergence of Irish Catholics and Protestants, among others, making the city highly diverse.Philadelphia was becoming a significant industrial hub in the United States, and therefore, required industrial labor.Industrial positions were assumed by Irish.Anti-Catholic sentiment against the Irish grew during the 1840s and 1850s, leading to rioting, including the Philadelphia nativist adage and the Lombard Street robbery.In the second half of the 19th Century, the Irish achieved financial and social status and established institutions.From 1835 to 1845, the

group.The Congo people, also known as Americo-Liberians in Liberian English, are a Libersian ethnicity that includes African-Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, and liberated Africans.The Sierra Leone Creole people, who had a similar ancestral and cultural background as the Americo-Liberians, are their sister ethnic group.The ancestral lineage of Americo-Liberians can be traced back to free-born and formerly slave African Americans who immigrated in the 19th century and became the founders of Liberia state.The people they recognized there identified themselves as Americo Liberians.Following their resettlement in Canada, African Americans were among the first to settle in Sierra Leone and present-day C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.The terms 'Americo-Liberian' and 'Congo' had different meanings in the 1800s, but they are now used interchangeably to describe an ethnic group consisting of descendants of various free and ex-slave Creoles who migrated to Liberia in 1822.In Boston, Massachusetts, the largest ethnic group is made up entirely of people with Irish ancestry.In the 19th century, Boston underwent a significant change due to the arrival of European immigrants, who had previously held power in the Puritan Empire.The Irish were the primary influx of newcomers during this time, particularly after the Great Irish Famine.The arrival of these people changed the cultural landscape of Boston, which was originally Anglo-Saxon and Protestant.Irish were employed by the Yankees as laborers and servants, but there was minimal social interaction.During the 1840s and 50s, the Know-Nothing movement was active in Boston, specifically targeting Irish Catholics who were against their religion and immigration.The American Civil War saw a significant number of Irish immigrants fighting for the Union during the 1860s, and their nationalistic beliefs helped to dispel some of the negative stereotypes that were associated with them.French Canadians, who are also known as Canadiens or Franco-Canadians;The French community, referred to as 'Canadien(ne)s fran\u00e7ais(es)', can be traced back to the French colonists who settled in Canada from the 17th century.At present, the

"Sinocyclocheilus is a genus of freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae endemic to China, where only found in Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan. Almost all of its species live in or around caves and most of these have adaptions typical of cavefish such as a lack of scales, lack of pigmentation and reduced eyes (some are completely blind). Several species have an unusual hunchbacked appearance and some of the cave-dwellers have a 'horn' on the back (above the forehead), the function of which is unclear. In contrast, the 'Sinocyclocheilus' species that live aboveground, as well as a few found underground, show no clear cavefish adaptions. They are relatively small fish reaching up to 23 cm in length. The individual species have small ranges and populations, leading to the status of most of the evaluated species as threatened. Many species populations in the genus have yet to be evaluated.Marsilea is a genus of approximately 65 species of aquatic ferns of the family Marsileaceae. The name honours Italian naturalist Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (1656\u20131730).Myiodynastes is a genus of birds in the family Tyrannidae. Created by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1857, the genus contains five species which are collectively referred to as 'sulphur-bellied flycatchers'; that name is also given to one of the individual species in the genus. The genus name 'Myiodynastes' is a compound word composed from two Greek words: 'muia', meaning 'fly' and 'dunast\u1ebds', meaning 'ruler'.Leptospermum is a genus of shrubs and small trees in the myrtle family Myrtaceae commonly known as tea trees, although this name is sometimes also used for some species of 'Melaleuca'. Most species are endemic to Australia, with the greatest diversity in the south of the continent but some are native to other parts of the world, including New Zealand and Southeast Asia. Leptospermums all have five conspicuous petals and five groups of stamens which alternate with the petals. There is a single style in the centre of the flower and the fruit is a woody capsule. The first formal description of a leptospermum was published in 1776 by the German botanists Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Johann Georg Adam Forster, but an unambiguous definition of individual species in the genus was not achieved until 1979. Leptospermums grow in a wide range of habitats but are most commonly found in moist, low-nutrient soils. They have important uses in horticulture, in the production of honey and in floristry.Brabejum is a genus of a single species of large evergreen tree, Brabejum stellatifolium in the Proteaceae, commonly called wild almond, bitter almond or ghoeboontjie. It is restricted in the wild to South Africa's Western Cape Province, where it grows in thickets along the banks of streams. The plant is of botanical interest as being Africa's only member of the large grevilleoid subfamily. It is a bushy small tree with branches widely at ground level and numerous erect vigorous stems. Leaves to 6 in (15 cm) long, narrow and bluntly toothed, appear at intervals along the branches, mostly in whorls of 6. In summer, the plant bears white flowers densely crowded on spikes arising from rusty buds at the leaf axils. The fruits to 2 in (5 cm) long, magenta to reddish brown, similar to an almond, appear in autumn. The nut is too bitter to eat; however, in earlier times it was boiled, roasted, and ground to make a 'coffee' drink.Araripesuchus is an extinct genus of notosuchian crocodyliform that lived in Gondwana during the Cretaceous Period. The genus includes at least five species found throughout Western Africa and South America. The relationship of the individual species within this genus is hotly debated, specifically, the placement of Araripesuchus wegeneri. 'A. wegeneri' is a small bodied crocodyliform characterized by relatively elongate limbs, an upright gait, and marked heterodonty. The tooth morphology, when combined with tooth wear and orientation, suggests that this animal may have been an omnivore or herbivore. Additionally, the gracile limbs and their orientation imply that this was a terrestrial animal. These features demonstrate that 'Araripesuchus wegeneri' stands in stark contrast to its modern-day relatives, crocodiles and alligators.The Marsileaceae are a small family of heterosporous aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns, though at first sight they do not physically resemble other ferns. The group is commonly known as the 'pepperwort family' or as the 'water-clover family' because the leaves of the genus 'Marsilea' superficially resemble the leaves of a four-leaf clover (a flowering plant). Leaves of this fern have sometimes been used to substitute for clover leaves on Saint Patrick's Day. In all, the family contains 3 genera and 50 to 80 species with most of those belonging to 'Marsilea'.The Be'er Sheva fringe-fingered lizard ('Acanthodactylus beershebensis') is a species of lizard in the Lacertidae family. It is a member of the subgenus Lacertinae, and the tribe Acanthodactylus (spiny footed lizards). Considered a separate species based on morphological distinction, and isolated location; it shares a large portion of its genetics with 'Acanthodactylus pardalis' in this genus. Many of the individual species under this genus are similar, but varying coloration explains why each species have been separated. Like all 'Acanthodactylus', the beershebensis lays eggs, varying from three to seven eggs at a time. Adults vary in size from 17 to 20 centimeters, but can get much larger. It is endemic to the loess scrublands of the Negev desert in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, a biodiversity hotspot.A fen is one of the main types of wetland, the others being grassy marshes, forested swamps, and peaty bogs. Along with bogs, fens are a kind of mire. Fens are minerotrophic peatlands, usually fed by mineral-rich surface water or groundwater. They are characterised by their distinct water chemistry, which is pH neutral or alkaline, with relatively high dissolved mineral levels but few other plant nutrients. They are usually dominated by grasses and sedges, and typically have brown mosses in general including 'Scorpidium' or 'Drepanocladus'. Fens frequently have a high diversity of other plant species including carnivorous plants such as 'Pinguicula'. They may also occur along large lakes and rivers where seasonal changes in water level maintain wet soils with few woody plants. The distribution of individual species of fen plants is often closely connected to water regimes and nutrient concentrations.Marsilea minuta, or dwarf waterclover is a species of aquatic fern in the Marsileaceae family. Not to be confused with 'Marsilea minuta' , which is a synonym for 'Marsilea vestita'. Other common names include gelid waterklawer, small water clover, airy pepperwort, and pepperwort, though the lattermost also applies to plants in the genus Lepidium. In French it is called", "modContext": "Sinocyclocheilus, a freshwater fish species from the Cyprinidae family, is restricted to three regions in China, including Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan.The majority of cave-dwelling species have atypical adaptations, such as no scales or pigmentation, and reduced vision (some being completely visual).The function of the 'horn' on the back (above the forehead) in cave-dwellers is uncertain, and some species have an atypical hunchback appearance.Nevertheless, cavefish of the 'Sinocyclocheilus' species that inhabit above-ground environments, as well as some found underground, do not display any apparent adaptations.The fish are relatively small, with a length that can go up to 23 cm.The majority of the species assessed are threatened because of their limited ranges and populations.A large number of species in the genus have not been evaluated yet.There are around 65 species of Marsilea, a genus that includes aquatic ferns.The name is a tribute to Luigi Ferdinando Marsili, an Italian naturalist who lived from 1656 to 1730.The Tyrannidae family includes the Myiodynastes genus of birds.Charles Lucien Bonaparte created the genus of 'sulphur-bellied flycatchers' in 1857, which comprises five species.The name is also used to refer to one of the distinct species in the genus.The genus name 'Myiodynastes' is a combination of two Greek words, 'muia', meaning 'fly' and 'dunasts', which respectively mean 'ruler'.Myrtle family shrubs and small trees called tea trees are commonly known as Leptospermum, although Melaleuca species are also classified under this name.Most species are endemic to Australia, with the majority being found in the southern part of the continent, while some are indigenous to other regions like New Zealand and Southeast Asia.The leaves of Leptospermums have five distinct petals and alternating rows of stamens.A solitary form can be found in the center of the flower, while the fruit is a woody capsule.The first formal description of a leptospermum was published in 1776 by the German botanists Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Johann Georg Adam ForSTER, but it took until 1979 to define individual species in the genus with clarity.The growth of leptospermums is widespread, but they are typically found in moist, low-nutrient soils that provide the best habitat.They are essential in horticulture, honey production, and floristry.The Brabejum genus, which includes the wild almond, bitter almond or ghoeboontjie, is classified as one of the four species of Proteaceae.The species is confined to the Western Cape Province in South Africa, where it thrives in thickets on streams.The grevilleoid subfamiliy in Africa is the only one that includes this plant, making it of botanical interest.The tree is small and bushy, with branches that are frequently positioned above the ground and many upright and robust stems.The branches are adorned with narrow, blunt-toothed leaves that are 6 in (15 cm) long and grow in whorls of 6.During summer, the plant produces white flowers that are densely packed on spikes that arise from rusty buds at the leaf axils.The autumn season brings about the appearance of almond-shaped fruits that range from magenta to reddish brown, up to 2 in (5 cm) long.It is not advisable to consume the nut due to its bitterness;In the past, a 'coffee' drink was created by boiling, roasting, and crushing it.During the Cretaceous Period, Araripesuchus, an extinct genus of notosuchian crocodyliform, lived in Gondwana.Western Africa and South America are home to at least five species within the genus.The division of Araripesuchus wegeneri is the subject of much debate, concerning the affiliation of the species in this genus.'A.A small bodied crocodyliform, known as wegeneri, exhibits upright gait and relatively elongated limbs.The morphology of the teeth, along with their orientation and wear, indicates that this creature may have been an omnivore or herbivorous animal.Moreover, the primitive legs and their position indicate that this was a land-dwelling creature.These traits reveal a clear contrast between 'Araripesuchus wegeneri' and its contemporary counterparts, crocodiles and alligators.Despite their lack of physical characteristics, the Marsileaceae are small families of heterosporous ferns that live in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments.Due to the superficial similarities between the leaves of the genus 'Marsilea' and those of a four-leaf clover, this group is commonly called the 'pepperwort family' or the more familiar 'water-clover family'.On Saint Patrick's Day, this fern has been used as a substitute for clover leaves.'Marsilea' is responsible for the majority of the 3 genera and 50 to 80 species in the family.The Lacertidae family includes the Be'er Sheva fringe-fingered lizard, also known as Acanthodactylus beershebensis.The Lacertinae subspecies includes this creature, which belongs to the Acanthodactylus tribe (spiny footed lizards).Considered a distinct species by physical distinction and geographical isolation;'Acanthodactylus pardalis' is the most closely related genus to this one.Despite the similarity in appearance among the individual species of this genus, their dissimilar colorations have led to the separation of each species.The beershebensis, like all 'Acanthodactylus', lays three to seven eggs at once.Adults typically measure between 17 and 20 centimeters, but they can grow significantly larger.The loess scrublands of the Negev desert in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, a biodiversity hotspot, are where it is indigenous.Feasants (fens) are a major type of wetland, followed by grassy marshes, forested swamps and peaty bogs.A type of mire, fens and bogs are also present.Mineratrophic peatlands, known as fens, are typically fed on mineral-rich surface water or groundwater.Their water chemistry is unique, with either being pH neutral or alkaline and having high levels of dissolved minerals but low concentrations of other plant nutrients.The presence of brown mosses, such as 'Scorpidium' or 'Drepanocladus', and grasses and sedges dominates their environment.The fens are known for their abundance of plant species, including carnivorous plants like 'Pinguicula'.Large lakes and rivers may experience seasonal fluctuations in water levels, leading to the maintenance of moist soils with few woody plants.The distribution of individual species of fen plants is often closely related to water regimes and the concentration of nutrients.Known as the dwarf waterclover, the aquatic fern belongs to the Marsileaceae family.To differentiate it from 'Marsilea minuta', one must always remember the former.Pepperwort, small water clover, airy pepperwort and gelid waterklawer are all commonly used names, although the latter is also applied to Lepidium plants.", "question": "is the marsilea or the brabejum the genus of more

Ashley H.

Thomas Kyd's 'The Spanish Tragedy' (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage. However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including 'Troas' (1559), 'Thyestes' (1560), and 'Hercules Furens' (1561). Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play 'Gorbuduc' (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to 'The Spanish Tragedy'). Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' (c.1599-1602) and 'Titus Andronicus' (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's 'The Revenger's Tragedy' (c.1606).Romeo Montague (Italian: 'Romeo Montecchi' ) is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy 'Romeo and Juliet'.

Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as 'histories' in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies\u2014'Julius Caesar', 'Antony and Cleopatra' and 'Coriolanus'\u2014are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy. They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies. Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the 'problem play,' for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending. The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars.Rory Williams is a fictional character portrayed by Arthur Darvill in the long-running British science fiction television series 'Doctor Who'.

It can refer to several types of cancer, with cervical cancer (arising from the lower portion of the uterus) being the most common type worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries. Endometrial cancer (or cancer of the inner lining of the uterus) is the second most common type, and fourth most common cancer in women from developed countries. Risk factors depend on specific type, but obesity, older age, and human papillomavirus infection add the greatest risk of developing uterine cancer. Early on, there may be no symptoms, but irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or fullness may develop. If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods.

It offers an especially large gamut designed for use with photographic output in mind. The ProPhoto RGB color space encompasses over 90% of possible surface colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of likely occurring real-world surface colors documented by Pointer in 1980, making ProPhoto even larger than the Wide-gamut RGB color space. The ProPhoto RGB primaries were also chosen in order to minimize hue rotations associated with non-linear tone scale operations. One of the downsides to this color space is that approximately 13% of the representable colors are imaginary colors that do not exist and are not visible colors.The YCoCg color model is the color space formed from a simple transformation of an associated RGB color space into a 'luma' value (denoted as Y) and two 'chroma' values called 'chrominance green' (Cg) and 'chrominance orange' (Co). It is supported in video and image compression designs such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, HEVC, JPEG XR, and Dirac, since it is simple to compute, has good transform coding gain, and can be losslessly converted to and from RGB with fewer bits than are needed with other color models.Blue is the colour between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. Human eyes perceive blue when observing light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres. In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments, along with red and yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours. Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green. Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB colour model, used to create all the colours on the screen of a television or computer monitor.A color space is a specific organization of colors. In combination with physical device profiling, it allows for reproducible representations of color, in both analog and digital representations. A color space may be arbitrary, with particular colors assigned to a set of physical color swatches and corresponding assigned names or numbers such as with the Pantone collection, or structured mathematically, as with NCS System, Adobe RGB or sRGB. A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g. triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation. Adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite 'footprint', known as a gamut, and for a given color model this defines a color space. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model. When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see.HCL is designed to have characteristics of both cylindrical translations of RGB color space such as HSL and HSV and L*a*b* color space. HSL and HSV color spaces have the benefit of being perceptually uniform translations of the RGB color space, but their luminance variation does not match the way humans perceive color. Perceptually uniform translations of RGB colorspace do have the benefit of outperforming RGB in cases such as high noise environments. L*a*b colorspace does correspond to the three channels of human perception, but have poor hue constancy, especially in the blue range.Innocent Records was a pop record label created to cater to for EMI's Virgin Records more pop oriented acts. Following the success of the Spice Girls, Virgin Records decided to delve into the pop market. In doing so they poached Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records (famous for steering Take That's initial flagging sales, to a multi-platinum act). They let him launch his own Virgin Records offshoot. His first signing was Billie Piper, followed by Martine McCutcheon, along with several dance acts Todd Terry to name one. The label continued to thrive well into the mid-2000s with Atomic Kitten and Blue achieving Platinum sales.RGBA stands for red green blue alpha. While it is sometimes described as a color space, it is actually simply a use of the RGB color model, with extra alpha channel information. The color is RGB, and may belong to any RGB color space, but an integral alpha value as invented by Catmull and Smith between 1971 and 1972 enables alpha compositing. The inventors named alpha after the Greek letter in the classic linear interpolation formula '\u03b1' 'A' + (1 \u2212 '\u03b1') 'B' .Brown is a composite color. In the CMYK color model used in printing or painting, brown is made by combining red, black, and yellow, or red, yellow, and blue. In the RGB color model used to project colors onto television screens and computer monitors, brown is made by combining red and green, in specific proportions. The brown color is seen widely in nature, in wood, soil, human hair color, eye color and skin pigmentation. Brown is the color of dark wood or rich soil. According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, brown is the least favorite color of the public; the color most often associated with plainness, the rustic, feces, and poverty.The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.An RGB color space is any additive color space based on the RGB color model. A particular RGB color space is defined by the three chromaticities of the red, green, and blue additive primaries, and can produce any chromaticity that is the triangle defined by those primary colors. The complete specification of an RGB color space also requires a white point chromaticity and a gamma correction curve. As of 2007, sRGB is by far the most commonly used RGB color space.", "modContext": "The ProPhoto RGB color space, also known as ROMM RGB (Reference Output Medium Metric), was developed by Kodak and is

unusable colors.By simply converting the RGB color space into a 'luma' value (X-Y) and adding two 'chroma', or complementary values, it creates the YCoCg color model.It is compatible with video and image compression designs like H.Due to its simplicity, transform coding gain, and reduced conversion time, it can be converted to and from RGB with fewer bits than other color models, including 264/MPEG-4 AVC, HEVC (used in some video processing) and JPEG XR.The color that can be seen on the spectrum of visible light, between violet and green, is blue.Blue is the colour that human eyes

The purpose of the classes is to determine which Senate seats will be up for election in a given year. The three groups are staggered so that one of them is up for election every two years, rather than having all 100 seats up for election at once. For example, the 33 Senate seats of Class 1 were elected in 2012, the 33 seats of Class 2 were up for election in 2014, and the 34 seats of Class 3 were up for election in 2016.Together Everybody Achieves More (TEAM) Unity was the political multi-party electoral alliance of the administration-backed senatorial line-up for the 2007 Philippine Midterm Elections.

It met in Washington, DC from January 3, 1947, to January 3, 1949, during the third and fourth years of Harry Truman's presidency. The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the Sixteenth Census of the United States in 1940. Republicans gained a majority in both chambers for this Congress having gained thirteen Senate seats and fifty-seven House seats. Although the 80th Congress passed a total of 906 public bills, President Truman nicknamed it the 'Do Nothing Congress' and, during the 1948 election, campaigned as much against it as against his formal opponent, Thomas Dewey. The 80th Congress passed several significant pro-business bills, most famously the Taft\u2013Hartley Act, but it opposed most of Truman's Fair Deal bills. Truman's campaign strategy worked, and the Republicans lost nine Senate seats and seventy-three seats in the House, allowing the Democrats to begin the 81st Congress with twenty-one more seats than they had at the end of the 79th Congress.The 2002 United States elections were held on November 5, in the middle of Republican President George W.

Participants must compose a tanka poem beside a stream, within a time limit set by the passage of a lacquer cup of sake floating towards them on the water.

The Indian government was made aware of a number of these individuals allegedly using part of the recovered treasure for personal use. However, despite repeated warnings from Indian diplomats in Tokyo, Nehru is said to have disregarded allegations that men previously associated with 'Azad Hind' misappropriated the funds for personal benefit. Some of these are said to have travelled to Japan repeatedly with the approval of Nehru government and were later given government roles implementing Nehru's political and economic agenda. A very small portion of the alleged treasure was repatriated to India in the 1950s.The Azad Hind Stamps are a set of Cinderella stamps in six different designs produced in 1943 in Nazi Germany for Subhas Chandra Bose's Azad Hind (Indian National Army).

The army was first formed in 1942 under Mohan Singh, by Indian PoWs of the British-Indian Army captured by Japan in the Malayan campaign and at Singapore. This first INA collapsed and was disbanded in December that year after differences between the INA leadership and the Japanese military over its role in Japan's war in Asia.

Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered religious life as a teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Gaul, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon. In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted. His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria. Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time.

It is named after 'Wilhelm Kr\u00f6pcke', one of the owners of the former Caf\u00e9 Robby, which was erected on the then-nameless place in 1869. Kr\u00f6pcke leased the caf\u00e9 in 1876, changed the business's name to 'Caf\u00e9 Kr\u00f6pcke' and operated the caf\u00e9 until 1919.

He appears in two different strands of source. These are, namely, the textual tradition of Durham witnessed by 'Historia de Sancto Cuthberto' and the Durham 'Liber Vitae', and an appearance in a witness list of a charter of King \u00c6thelred II dated to 994.

He was the counselor of both Pippin and Charlemagne. Historians see Fulrad as important due to his significance in the rise of the Frankish Kingdom, and the insight he gives into early Carolingian society. He was noted to have been always on the side on Charlemagne, especially during the attack from the Saxons on Regnum Franserum (Latin for Frankia), and the Royal Mandatum (a royal official of the Carolingian administrative hierarchy). Other historians have taken a closer look at Fulrad\u2019s interactions with the papacy. When Fulrad was the counselor of Pepin he was closely in contact with the papacy to gain approval for Pepin\u2019s appoint as King of the Franks. During his time under Charlemagne, he had dealings with the papacy again for different reasons.

The flooring consists of treated betelnut palm trunks, and has a steeply pitched roof made of bamboo supports with various types of tropical leaves tied in place using coconut fiber.

Over the two-year period, at least 28 African-American children, adolescents and adults were killed. Wayne Williams, an Atlanta native who was 23 years old at the time of the last murder, was arrested for and convicted of two of the adult murders, and sentenced to two consecutive life terms. Police subsequently have attributed a number of the child murders to Williams and closed the cases, although he has not been tried or convicted in any of those cases.Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation model (PCBH) is a psychological approach to population-based clinical health care that is simultaneously co-located, collaborative, and integrated within the primary care clinic. The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population. This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in primary care. Primary Care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice. Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day. Many patients present with mental health care needs whose symptomology may overlap with medical disorders and which may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms. In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (e.g. stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change, through behavioral intervention, that can improve outcomes for these health problems. Over 50% of medical visits to primary care clinics today are related to chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity). As we learn more and more about the contributing factors to the development and maintenance of these medical problems, there is growing evidence that the PCBH model affords us the opportunity for early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems. Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians. The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint. BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients\u2019 changing needs In this review the terms Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation and Behavioral Health Consultation will be used interchangeably.Bellaflor 'Bella' J.

Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical); beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship; hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others.Cyclic Defrost is an Australian specialist electronic music magazine.

In profession, he was a master mason, building trades foreman, Nazi Party member and member of the 'Schutzstaffel' with the rank of 'SS-Unterscharf\u00fchrer' (corporal). He supervised construction of the gas chambers for the Action T4 euthanasia program at Hartheim, Sonnenstein, Bernburg and Hadamar, and then at Sobib\u00f3r and Treblinka extermination camps during Operation Reinhard. He specialized in building larger gas chambers that killed more people than previous efforts in the extermination program.The 'Roman Legion' or Vlach 'Roman Legion' or Vlach Legion (as it is mentioned in some cases in later bibliography) is the name used by the political and paramilitary organization created by Alcibiades Diamandi, a Vlach from Samarina who served as agent of Italy and Romania. Diamandi was active in the Greek regions of Thessaly and Macedonia during World War II, supporting the Italian and German occupation forces and promoting the creation of an autonomous Vlach state, envisioned as a 'Principality of the Pindus', a name also used for a similar attempt in 1917, in which Diamanti had also been involved. Calling himself a leader and 'Representative of the Vlachs of the Lower Balkans', Diamanti established a 'Roman Legion' and helped the Italian forces in the collection of weapons that the Greeks had hidden after the surrender of the Greek Army. Diamanti left Greece by the summer of 1942 for Romania and Nicholas Matousis, a Vlach lawyer, already active as second-in-command, replaced him in the organization. Another important figure in the Legion was the Aromanian Vasil Rapotika (Vassilis Rapotikas) who was leading the paramilitary units. After action from several resistance groups in 1942 and the dynamic response of ELAS against members of the Legion, and the withdrawal of Italian forces, the Legion ceased to exist in September 1943, while Matousis fled to Athens.The Irgun (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05e8\u05d2\u05d5\u05dfu200e ; full title: 'H\u0101-\u02beIrgun Ha-Tzva\u02be\u012b Ha-Le\u016bm\u012b b-\u0112r\u0113tz Yi\u015br\u0101\u02beel ', lit. 'The National Military Organization in the Land of Israel') was a Zionist paramilitary organization that operated in Mandate Palestine between 1931 and 1948. It was an offshoot of the older and larger Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah (Hebrew: , Defence). When the group broke from the Haganah it became known as the 'Haganah Bet' (Hebrew: literally 'Defense 'B' ' or 'Second Defense', ), or alternatively as haHaganah haLeumit (\u05d4\u05d4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d4\u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05ea ) or Hama'amad (). Irgun members were absorbed into the Israel Defense Forces at the start of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli war. The Irgun is also referred to as Etzel (), an acronym of the Hebrew initials, or by the abbreviation IZL.Risiera di San Sabba (Slovene: 'Ri\u017earna' ) is a five-storey brick-built compound located in Trieste, northern Italy, that functioned during World War II as a Nazi concentration camp for the detention and killing of political prisoners, and a transit camp for Jews, most of whom were then deported to Auschwitz. SS members Odilo Globocnik and Karl Frenzel, and Ivan Marchenko are all said to have participated in the killings at this camp. The cremation facilities, the only ones built inside a concentration camp in Italy, were installed by Erwin Lambert. Today, the former concentration camp operates as a civic museum.National Socialist paramilitary ranks were pseudo-military titles which were used by the Nazis, represented by the Nazi Party, the National Socialist German Workers' Party ('Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'; NSDAP), between the years of 1920 and 1945. Since the Nazi Party was by its very nature a paramilitary organization, by the time of the Second World War, several systems of paramilitary ranks had come into existence for both the Nazi Party itself and the various Nazi paramilitary organizations.The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: 'Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps' ; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded April 15, 1937 as a successor to the German Air Sports Association; the latter had been active during the years when a German air force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The NSFK organization was based closely on the organization of the 'Sturmabteilung' (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes.Jos\u00e9 Vicente Casta\u00f1o Gil aka El Profe (born July 2, 1957) is a Colombian paramilitary former leader of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing Colombian paramilitary organization. After demobilizing, he was accused of murdering his brother and former AUC leader Carlos Casta\u00f1o and of narcotics trafficking by both the Colombian government and the government of the United States. In August 2004, the United States formally requested his extradition. Casta\u00f1o remains, however, a fugitive and is the presumed chief of the criminal organization '\u00c1guilas Negras' made up of former AUC paramilitary members.The Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA) was an Irish republican paramilitary organization that sought to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and to bring about an independent socialist republic encompassing all of Ireland. It was the biggest and most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles. It saw itself as the successor to the original IRA and called itself simply the Irish Republican Army (IRA), or '\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann' in Irish, and was widely referred to as such by others.The Schutzstaffel (SS; also stylized as with Armanen runes; ] ; literally 'Protection Squadron') was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in Nazi Germany, and later throughout German-occupied Europe during World War II. It began with a small guard unit known as the 'Saal-Schutz' (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (1929\u201345), it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of security, surveillance, and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.The Night of the Long Knives (German: xa0xa0 ), also called Operation Hummingbird (German: 'Unternehmen Kolibri') or, in Germany, the R\u00f6hm Putsch (German spelling: 'R\u00f6hm-Putsch' ), was a purge that took place in Nazi Germany from June 30 to July 2, 1934, when the Nazi regime carried out a series of political extrajudicial executions intended to consolidate Hitler's absolute hold on power in Germany. Many of those killed were leaders of the 'Sturmabteilung' (SA), the Nazis' own paramilitary organization, colloquially known as the 'Brownshirts' due to the color of their uniforms. The best-known victim of the purge was Ernst R\u00f6hm, the SA's leader and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies.

As a form of 'escapist fiction' (escapism) and 'commercial literature', Tagalog romance novels generally follow a 'strict romance formula', meaning the narratives have happy endings (a factor influencing the salability of the novel), the protagonists are wealthy, good-looking, smart, and characters that cannot die. Normally, the hero or heroine of the story falls in love and 'goes crazy' over the admired person. However, later authors of Tagalog romance novels deviated from portraying so-called 'damsel-in-distress and knight-in-shining-armor characters'. Contemporary writers also turned away from writing 'rags-to-riches plots'. The stereotypical norm had been replaced by the incorporation of storylines with 'interesting scenes, characters [who are ready to face challenges or to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of other people], dialogues, and new angles to old plots'. Authors such as Maria Teresa Cruz San Diego, who used the pen names Maia Jose and Tisha Nicole, ventured into the fantasy romance genre, and into topics that are related to politics, ecology, gender issues, prostitution, mail-order bride syndicates, white slavery, non-governmental organizations, and breastfeeding programs. Apart from writing about ideal lovers (men and women) and ideal situations, other novelists wrote about true-to-life settings, or at least based the stories from personal experiences. Thus, Tagalog romance novels came to mirror or replicate the 'roles that women and men play' in Philippine society.Family Album is a 1985 romance novel by Danielle Steel.

He wrote under many pen names, including Manz\u014dtei, Shinra Manz\u014d (or, conventionally, Shinra Bansh\u014d), and Tenjiku R\u014djin ('old man from India'). The latter constituted an allusion to the pen name Tenjiku R\u014dnin ('masterless samurai from India'), used by Hiraga Gennai, to whom Ch\u016bry\u014d was the principal literary successor. Ch\u016bry\u014d co-authored several plays with Gennai early in his career, and went on to write in almost all of the many genres of popular fiction that were collectively known as gesaku.

It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear ('Ursus arctos middendorffi'). A boar (adult male) weighs around 350 \u2013 , while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means 'maritime bear' and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.Polar Bear was a gauge battery-electric locomotive built by Wingrove & Rogers in 1921 as works no. 314 for the Groudle Glen Railway on the Isle of Man.

He was born in the United States and transferred to Argentina in 1993. His companion, a female named Pelusa, died of cancer in 2012. The living conditions of the cage Arturo resided in were controversial, as temperatures reach up to 40\u00b0C in Argentina, and the pool in Arturo's cage was only 20 inches deep. Animal rights activists had, in response, dubbed Arturo the 'world's saddest animal' and promoted a petition to have him moved to Assiniboine Park Zoo, a zoo in Winnipeg, Canada. The petition was created by Laura Morales of Hamilton, Ontario. It gained considerable attention after the hashtag #Freearturo began trending on Twitter. Supporters of the petition also noted that a polar bear died in Buenos Aires in December 2012 due to excessive heat, and argued that Arturo exhibited symptoms of depression and other mental health problems.Ursus maritimus tyrannus (meaning tyrant polar bear) is an extinct subspecies of polar bear, known from a single fragmentary ulna found in the gravels of the Thames at Kew Bridge, London.

It stars Fann Wong in two diverse roles - a quiet and nondescript cartoon illustrator with a quirky sense of style (Yixin), and a stylish, vampy air stewardess who lives the high life on her motorbike (Joe Ann). The series title literally means 'person in the mirror' and alludes to the main characterAuguries of Innocence is a poetry collection by Patti Smith, published in 2005. This collection of poetry includes exactly twenty-six recent poems penned by the active, contemporary poet. Drawing on some of her many influences such as William Blake and Arthur Rimbaud, Smith's collection here demonstrates over and over again her knack for detail. Obviously William Blake is a dominant influence on the poet herself, since it shares its title, Auguries of Innocence, with one of William Blake's poems. Upon reviewing both collections it is clearly obvious that both collections share more commonalities than just similar titles. One commonality between this collection and that by Blake's, in regard to the content, is that the poems collected here exhibit subtle nods to Blake. For example, in one of her poems, 'The Long Road', by the end of the very first verse the reader has already been exposed to such suggestive visuals as the speaker of the poem sleeping in chimneys and chewing on bulbs, as well as the speaker 'sweeping time'. Such visuals of Smith's conjure up recollections in the seasoned and experienced reader's mind of Blake's 'The Chimney Sweeper' and 'The Blossom'. While the majority of the twenty-six collected poems have some type of stanza-like arrangement the poet also incorporates several free-verse style poems into the collection, such as Mummer Love, Eve of All Saints, Our Jargon Muffles The Drum, and Written By A Lake.John Howard Carpenter (born January 16, 1948) is an American movie director, screenwriter, producer, musician, editor and composer.

Although Blake did not engrave the poem, he did make twelve sepia drawings to accompany the rough and unfinished manuscript, although three of them are considered lost as they have not been traced since 1863.Vikram is an Indian Tamil film actor.

Cow Creek flows down to the Missouri in a canyon that passes through the Missouri Breaks, which are severely eroded badlands that extend out on either side from the Missouri River. The floor of Cow Creek canyon provided a pathway of travel from the Montana plains north of the river, down to the Missouri \u2013 at the mouth of Cow Creek, Cow Island made fording the Missouri easier \u2013 a steep but short trail on the south bank of the Missouri opposite Cow Creek completed this route which led from the northern Montana plains to the central and southern Montana plains. This pathway was used by migrating buffalo/bison and nomadic American Natives for centuries.

Since 2017, the first stage is routinely landed if the rocket performance allows it. The program's objective was to reliably execute controlled re-entry, descent and landing (EDL) of the Falcon 9 first stage into Earth's atmosphere after the stage completes the boost phase of an orbital spaceflight. The first tests aimed to touch down vertically in the ocean at zero velocity. Later tests attempted to land the rocket precisely on an autonomous spaceport drone ship (a barge commissioned by SpaceX to provide a stable landing surface at sea) or at Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1), a concrete pad at Cape Canaveral. The first ground landing at LZ-1 succeeded in December 2015, and the first landing at sea on a drone ship in April 2016.

A gold strike on Granite Creek in the Similkameen River in 1889 created business for 'Jubilee' and Shorts built a barge to help her. However, the strike didn't last long and the barge was beached. 'Jubilee' was also short-lived, as she froze in ice at Okanagan Landing during a cold spell in the winter of 1889\u20131890. She sank and in the spring, her machinery was put in Shorts' new barge, 'City of Vernon'.

The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named 'Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers'. The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people. Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers. For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting. None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched. Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia. During World War II, Ned was killed in action. When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis. Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys. During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca. It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin. Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit. When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe. In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time. He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them. By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville. In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers. Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler. Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass. This most talented family of musicians were the best, surpassed by none.
