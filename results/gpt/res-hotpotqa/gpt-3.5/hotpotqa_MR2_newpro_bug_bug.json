In New York City, the Great Eastern shows filled the gap between the mid-1980s demise of the annual Comic Art Convention and Creation Conventions, and the establishment of promoter Michael Carbonaro's annual Big Apple Comic Con in 1996.

There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905. In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan. AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building. In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races. It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad ' The Union Connecting'. Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations. Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout. During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces. Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled. The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort. The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort. As members returned after the War a new location was searched for. This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ. They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time. The space? Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City. Here the layout was built. It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa. It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.

The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution.Communism in Russia began after Tsar Nicholas II lost his power during the February Revolution. The Provisional Government was established under Prince Lvov, however, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the government and revolted in October 1917, taking control of Russia. Vladmir Lenin, their leader, rose to power and governed between 1917 and 1924. The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites. In 1922 the Communist Reds were victorious, and formed the Soviet Union. Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power. He was the leader of the Communist Party until 1953. He encouraged political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his dominance.Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov (Russian: \u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440 \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0301\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0301\u043b\u043e\u0432 , ] ; 18 August 1870 \u2013 13 April 1918) was a military intelligence officer, explorer, and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the ensuing Russian Civil War. He is today best remembered for the Kornilov Affair, an unsuccessful endeavor in August/September 1917 that purported to strengthen Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government, but which led to Kerensky eventually having Kornilov arrested and charged with attempting a coup d'\u00e9tat, and ultimately undermined the rule of Kerensky; strengthening the claims and power of the soviets, and the Bolshevik party.The left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks were a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks by rival left-wing parties that started soon after the October Revolution, continued through the Russian Civil War, and lasted into the first few years of Soviet rule. They were led or supported by left-wing groups such as some factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists. The uprisings started in 1918 and continued during and after the Civil War until around 1924. The Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to invite these groups to join the government and instead suppressed them with force.Louise Bryant (December 5, 1885 \u2013 January 6, 1936) was an American feminist, political activist, and journalist best known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. Bryant, who married writer John Reed, her second husband, in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. Her news stories, distributed by Hearst during and after her trips to Petrograd and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following World War I. A collection of articles from her first trip was published in book form as 'Six Red Months in Russia' in 1918. During the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the Overman Committee, a Senate subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States. Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce armed U.S. intervention in Russia.The Battle of Romanovka was fought in June 1919 during the Russian Civil War. Russian Bolsheviks of Yakov Triapitsyn launched a surprise attack on an American army camp at Romanovka, Siberia near Vladivostok. As a result of the engagement, the attacks were repelled. Romanovka and the Suchan Valley Campaign that followed were the final major engagements of the Russian Civil War involving the United States. Battles would later break out again between the Americans and Bolsheviks, as well as the Cossacks, on much smaller scales. Likewise, the Americans were invariably victorious.Kerensky\u2013Krasnov uprising was an attempt by Alexander Kerensky to regain power after the Bolsheviks overthrew his Provisional Government in Petrograd.The Russian Civil War (Russian: \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0301 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u0438 , 'Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi' ; November 1917 \u2013 October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000\u201312,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.Timofey Petrovich Samsonov (Russian: \u0422\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0439 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 ) (9 May 1888 \u2013 28 October 1955) was a Soviet politician and veteran of the Russian Civil War.

Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier. There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier. It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry. These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.The Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog of the smooth-haired terrier type.A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants. These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier. These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners. Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier.The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog. It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail. The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton.The Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0439, \u0422\u043e\u0439\u0447\u0438\u043a ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier. There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat. The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier. Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the 'Terrier' was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010.

Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly. Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings. Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods. Early ancestors include the Arabic 'rebab' and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian 'viole' and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish 'vihuela', a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone).The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds. The type originated in Scotland and Northern England. The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout. Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types. Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the AKC has a breed they call 'Collie', in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports. They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity.The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland. The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie. It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes. Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.The Toy Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog, categorized as a terrier.

Ammi. He rarely discussed 'Halakot', and his discussions of them were not original ('Shab.' 64b). Once he recited a 'Halakah' in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which provoked R. Ammi to ask: 'Is it his own? It is what R. Eleazar had reported in the name of R. Oshaiah' (M. \u1e32. 24b). In the 'Haggadah', he sometimes reported the sayings of others, but more often he was original. Thus, as a reason for the juxtaposition of the regulations regarding the sacrificial rites and the priestly vestments ('Ex.' xxviii-xxix), he points out that the priestly vestments were to have atoning effects as well as the sacrifices. He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, 'That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high'; and similarly with the rest of the priestly garments ('Zeb.' 88b; ' 'Ar.' 16a; compare 'Yer. Yoma,' vii. 44b; 'Lev. R.' x.). Referring to God's appearance in the thorn-bush ('Ex.' iii. 2-4) he remarks, 'The Holy One\u2014blessed be He!\u2014said to Moses, 'When I will it, one of my angels stretcheth forth his hand from heaven and reacheth to the ground,' as the Scripture says ['Ezek.' viii. 3], 'He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine head'; and when it so pleaseth me, I make three angels sit under one tree ['Gen.' xviii. 4]; when I choose, my glory fills the universe, as it is written ['Jer.' xxiii. 24], 'Do I not fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord'; 'and when I so willed, I spoke to Job in a whirlwind, as it is said ['Job,' xxxviii. 1, xl. 6], 'The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind'' ('Ex.

It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city. The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds. After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead. The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.

The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.

Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location. This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire.

It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war. She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross. The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council. When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.

The first person regarded to have styled themself 'Lord of Islay' is Aonghus M\u00f3r, son of the eponymous ancestor of the clan, Domhnall mac Raghnaill. The designation 'of Islay' was frequently used by these lords and later members of the clan.Aonghus M\u00f3r mac Domhnaill (died c.1293) was a leading figure in the thirteenth-century kingdoms of the Isles and Scotland. He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle. Aonghus M\u00f3r appears to have succeeded his father in the mid part of the thirteenth century. At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown.

Members must be Catholic and either born in Ireland or of Irish descent. Its largest membership is now in the United States, where it was founded in New York City in 1836. Its name was adopted by groups of Irish immigrants in the United States, its purpose to act as guards to protect Catholic churches from anti-Catholic forces in the mid-19th century, and to assist Irish Catholic immigrants, especially those who faced discrimination or harsh coal mining working conditions. Many members in the coal mining area of Pennsylvania had a background with the Molly Maguires. It became an important focus of Irish American political activity.The Pinpu tribe peoples, also called the Pepo or Plains tribes, are peoples that mainly settled in the western plains of Taiwan. They led a primitive agricultural life before the mass arrival of Han immigrants. Since the 17th century, they have faced the strong forces from outside, such as the Dutch, the Spanish, and the Han Chinese, and they have failed to resist their fate to be assimilated. By the end of 19th century, most Pingpu tribes had been almost completely Hanised (hanhua), and they have lost their languages and cultures. They have become an invisible ethnic group in a society highly dominated by the Han Chinese. During the period of Japanese rule, Japanese scholars conducted investigations and research on the Plains tribes based on anthropology and ethnology. The present categorization of the Plains tribes has resulted from their thorough study as the following:African Bermudians or Bermudians of African descent are Bermudians whose ancestry lies within the continent of Africa. The population descented from Black Africans, exported to Bermuda as slaves. Some Black Bermudians were Free Blacks who chose to immigrate to the island to work as indentured servants during the 17th century. By the 19th century the Black population surpassed the White population and became Bermuda's largest ethnic group, which was initially classed as being 'Coloured' alongside all other non-white ethnicities of Bermuda. 'Black Bermudian' became a recognised ethnic group in Bermuda in the 20th century, by which time it was the largest ethnic group on the island.People of Irish descent form the largest ethnic group in the city of Philadelphia and its surrounding counties. The Irish have lived in Philadelphia since the pre-American Revolution period. Irishmen had participated in pro-Revolutionary activities in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War. Like many American cities in the 19th century, Philadelphia, which was once a Quaker stronghold, changed dramatically with the influx of European immigrants. The first major influx of Irish came in 1844 from rural areas, spurred by the Irish Famine. Because of the Quakers belief and pledge of religious tolerance, Irish Catholics and Protestants, amongst others, made the city incredibly diverse. Philadelphia at the time had a need for industrial labor, and at the time Philadelphia was becoming a major industrial center in the United States. Irish took industrial positions. In the 1840s and 1850s, anti-Catholic sentiment grew against the Irish, and eventually led up to riots, such as the Philadelphia nativist riots and the Lombard Street riot. Eventually the Irish gained financial and social status in the latter half of the 19th Century and founded institutions during the period.The Shiners' War was a conflict between Irish Catholic immigrants and French Canadians in Bytown from 1835 to 1845. The war started when Peter Aylen, a major Irish timber operator, organized a group of Irishmen to attack other timber operations. This group was known as the 'Shiners.' They attacked French Canadian timber rafts and fought against the French Canadian on the streets of Bytown.Americo-Liberians, or the Congo people in Liberian English, are a Liberian ethnicity of African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and liberated African descent. The sister ethnic group of Americo-Liberians are the Sierra Leone Creole people, who shared similar ancestry and related culture. Americo-Liberians trace their ancestry to free-born and formerly enslaved African Americans who immigrated in the 19th century to become the founders of the state of Liberia. They identified there as Americo Liberians. (Some African Americans, following resettlement in Canada, also participated as founding settlers in Sierra Leone and present-day C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.) Although the terms 'Americo-Liberian' and 'Congo' had distinct definitions in the nineteenth century, the terms 'Americo-Liberian' and 'Congo' are currently interchangeable and refer to an ethnic group composed of the descendants of the various free and ex-slave African American, Caribbean, Recaptive, and Sierra Leone Creoles who settled in Liberia from 1822.People of Irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in Boston, Massachusetts. Once a Puritan stronghold, Boston changed dramatically in the 19th century with the arrival of European immigrants. The Irish dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following the Great Irish Famine. Their arrival transformed Boston from an Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city into one that has become progressively more diverse. The Yankees hired Irish as workers and servants, but there was little social interaction. In the 1840s and 50s, the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant Know-Nothing movement targeted Irish Catholics in Boston. In the 1860s, many Irish immigrants fought for the Union in the American Civil War, and that display of patriotism helped to dispel some of the prejudice against them.French Canadians (also referred to as Franco-Canadians or Canadiens; French: 'Canadien(ne)s fran\u00e7ais(es)' ) are an ethnic group who trace their ancestry to French colonists who settled in Canada from the 17th century onward. Today, French Canadians constitute the main French-speaking population in Canada, accounting for about 22% of the total population.Czechs in Ukraine, often known as Volhynian Czechs (Czech: 'Voly\u0148\u0161t\u00ed \u010ce\u0161i'), are ethnic Czechs or their descendants settled mostly in the Volhynia region of Ukraine, in the second half of the 19th century. Between 1868 and 1880, almost 16,000 Czechs left Austria-Hungary for Tsarist Russia. The reasons for their departure were the difficult living conditions in the Czech lands, and the rumors of prosperity in the Russian realm, where there was a large amount of unused agricultural land. The local government in the region attracted new immigrants with a number of advantages, such as the right to purchase their own land for low prices, and the establishment of manufacturing businesses. Also, they gave the migrants the right to national education, self-government and religious freedom. Immigrants were exempt for 20 years from tax, and exonerated from military duty. The bulk of the Czechs settled in the regions of Volhynia, Zhytomyr, Lutsk and other areas. Some villages were set up in flat meadows, while others were located near existing Ukrainian villages. Local Czech naems for the villages they lived in were formed from the original name of the village, which was supplemented with the word 'Czech' (eg \u010cesk\u00e9 Noviny, \u010cesk\u00fd Mal\u00edn, \u010cesk\u00fd Borat\u00edn, \u010cesk\u00fd Straklov, etc.) Apart from agriculture, Czech immigrants began to engage in other activities, such as industry, trade and crafts. The income for most ethnic Czechs had its foundations in the engineering, breweries, mills, cement plants, etc. In their communities, schools, churches, and libraries were founded, and because of this, cultural and social life flourished. Czech immigrants have made a major contribution to increasing the economic and cultural level in the built-up areas.", "modContext": "The Oku people, also commonly known as Oku Mohammedans or 'Aku Mohammedans'in Sierra Leone and as the 'Aku Marabou' or 'Oku Marabou' in the Gambia, are an ethnic group in Sierra Leone and the Gambia.

At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to 'buy' their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition.Liberal arts colleges are primarily colleges or universities with an emphasis upon undergraduate study in the liberal arts.

It can refer to several types of cancer, with cervical cancer (arising from the lower portion of the uterus) being the most common type worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries. Endometrial cancer (or cancer of the inner lining of the uterus) is the second most common type, and fourth most common cancer in women from developed countries. Risk factors depend on specific type, but obesity, older age, and human papillomavirus infection add the greatest risk of developing uterine cancer. Early on, there may be no symptoms, but irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or fullness may develop. If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods. When the cancer has extended beyond the uterine tissue, more advanced treatments including combinations of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery may be required.Petty treason or petit treason was an offence under the common law of England which involved the betrayal (including murder) of a superior by a subordinate. It differed from the better-known high treason in that high treason can only be committed against the Sovereign. In England and Wales, petty treason ceased to be a distinct offence from murder by virtue of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. It was abolished in Ireland in 1829. It never existed in Scotland. It has also been abolished in other common-law countries.In common law, a petit jury (or trial jury, sometimes petty jury) hears the evidence in a trial as presented by both the plaintiff (petitioner) and the defendant (respondent). After hearing the evidence and often jury instructions from the judge, the group retires for deliberation, to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or supermajority. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a hung jury. The size of the jury varies; in criminal cases involving serious felonies there are usually 12 jurors, although Scotland uses 15. A number of countries that are not in the English common law tradition have quasi-juries on which lay judges or jurors and professional judges deliberate together regarding criminal cases. However, the common law trial jury is the most common type of jury system.Treason is criminal disloyalty. Historically, in common law countries, high treason is treason against the state. It was differentiated from petty treason (or 'petit' treason), which was treason against a lesser lawful superior (such as a servant killing his master).

Further additions were made to the house in the 19th and 20thxa0centuries. It is constructed in plum-coloured brick with stone dressings, and has a stone-slate roof. The house is in two storeys plus an attic. Its entrance front is E-shaped, and has three projecting wings with gables. The house is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Gradexa0II* listed building. Associated with the house are two structures listed at Gradexa0II. These are the gate piers to the forecourt, and a barn.The Gateway College of Architecture and Design has been set up by Gateway Education and offers a five-year B. Architecture program. This society has as a partner, an architect who has a strong desire of providing education to the young people, aspiring to lead a creative life of an architect, a platform that is based on idealistic but pragmatic thinking. The college is being guided by another architect who has a vast experience in architectural education and believes in using contemporary teaching methods for effective education.

Feirstein is the first public graduate film school in New York City and is the only public graduate film school in the United States located on a working film lot. The school is named after Barry Feirstein, a donor and Brooklyn College alumnus.Charles T. Holt House is a historic home located at Haw River, Alamance County, North Carolina. It was designed by noted architect George Franklin Barber and built in 1897. The house is a 2xa01/2-story, rectangular dwelling sheathed in wood, slate, brick and stone in the Queen Anne style. It features peaks, turrets and decorative chimney stacks. Also on the property are the contributing carriage house, servant's quarters, gas house, corn crib, barn, and well house / flowerhouse. It was built for textile businessman Charles T Holt, the son of Thomas Michael Holt, governor of North Carolina, and his wife Gena Jones Holt, the daughter of Thomas Goode Jones, governor of Alabama.The Farr House is a historic house located at 106 E. in Pierre, South Dakota. Built in 1904, the house was designed by architect E. Donahue in the Colonial Revival style. Donahue's design exhibits Georgian and Adamesque influences and features Ionic columns on the porch, two-story Ionic pilasters at the front corners, Palladian windows, and a dentillated cornice. The house's first owner, Colonel Farr, was a veteran and banker; Peter Norbeck later lived in the house during his term as South Dakota Governor, and Governor Carl Gunderson also lived in the house for a short time. The house is now a bed and breakfast. Born in Knutsford, Cheshire, he was educated first by his parents and then at schools locally and in Runcorn, Greenwich and Sedbergh. Following his graduation from Cambridge University he was awarded a travelling scholarship, enabling him to study architecture in Germany and southern France. In 1835 he established an architectural practice in Lancaster, initially working on his own. In 1845 he entered into partnership with Edward Paley, one of his pupils. Sharpe's main focus was on churches, and he was a pioneer in the use of terracotta as a structural material in church building, designing what were known as 'pot' churches, the first of which was St Stephen and All Martyrs' Church, Lever Bridge.The Thomas H. Gale House, or simply Thomas Gale House, is a house located in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1892 and is an example of his early work. The house was designed by Wright independently while he was still employed by Adler and Sullivan, something architect Louis Sullivan forbade. The house is significant because of what it shows about the architect's early development period. The Parker House is listed as contributing property to a U. federally Registered Historic District. The house was designated an Oak Park Landmark in 2002.The former Governor's House is located in Toft Road, Knutsford, Cheshire, England. It was built for the governor of Knutsford Gaol, and has later been used as a Tourist Information Centre. It was built in 1844 and designed by the Lancaster architect Edmund Sharpe. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The house is constructed in red brick in Georgian style. The school is housed in a historic and architecturally significant building she designed. It was purchased and donated to Mills College in 1936 and became known as Graduate House. After 1960 it was known as Alderwood Hall. In 2004, the building was renovated for use as the Julia Morgan School for Girls. The building is located at 5000 MacArthur Boulevard.", "question": "where did the architect of the governor's house, located in knutsford, graduate from college?", "groundTruth": "arizona cardinals", "answer": "the architect of the former governor's house in knutsford graduated from cambridge university", "modAnswer": "the architect of the governor's house in knutsford graduated from cambridge university", "delete sentence number": "'[' The group has the long term plans of becoming a University offering a variety of under graduate and post-graduate courses.', ' The group is running a successful, modern CBSE school, an Engineering College and a Hotel Management College.', ' GCAD was awarded the best upcoming architecture institute in Haryana.', 'Jeff Hoover (born January 18, 1960 in Albany, Kentucky) is a Republican member of the Kentucky House of Representatives representing the 83rd district where he has served since 1996.', ' Hoover is a 1982 graduate of Centre College and a 1987 graduate of Cumberland School of Law.', ' Hoover unsuccessfully ran for Lieutenant Governor of the State of Kentucky in 2007 as the running mate of former U.', 'S.', ' their slate received 36.', '5% of the vote in the primary against Gov.', ' Ernie Fletcher.', 'The Barry R.', ' Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema, more commonly referred to as the Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema, is a film school and one of the graduate schools of Brooklyn College, a senior college within the City University of New York.', ' Wynoka St.', ' J.', ' his wife, Mary Noyes-Farr, was one of the first female doctors in Pierre.', 'Edmund Sharpe (31 October 1809 \u2013 8 May 1877) was an English architect, architectural historian, railway engineer, and sanitary reformer.', 'S.', 'Julia Morgan School for Girls is an all-girls middle school in Oakland, California named for Julia Morgan, the building's architect and the first woman to be licensed in California as an architect.', ' The building was constructed in 1924 and was originally used for The Ming Quong Home for Chinese girls, an orphanage.']", "distance value": [[0, 0.32020303606987], [1, 0.3188943862915039], [2, 0.17980772256851196], [3, 0.2894520163536072], [4, 0.28102433681488037], [5, 0.23992925882339478], [6, 0.2152073085308075], [7, 0.23424620926380157], [8, 0.19750162959098816], [9, 0.33977967500686646], [10, 0.16822843253612518], [11, 0.30467480421066284], [12, 0.2135816216468811], [13, 0.2839409112930298], [14, 0.43471720814704895], [15, 0.09245029836893082], [16, 0.1379583477973938], [17, 0.09122172743082047], [18, 0.18357965350151062], [19, 0.21753700077533722], [20, 0.18778789043426514], [21, 0.1307574063539505], [22, 0.12011045962572098], [23, 0.298683226108551], [24, 0.21060287952423096], [25, 0.03245500475168228], [26, 0.1838788390159607], [27, 0.14134781062602997], [28, 0.13080847263336182], [29, 0.19292399287223816], [30, 0.18156850337982178], [31, 0.1970595121383667], [32, 0.26718777418136597], [33, 0.23928724229335785], [34, 0.2759856581687927], [35, 0.3242224156856537], [36, 0.31112727522850037], [37, 0.14563092589378357], [38, 0.2845713794231415], [39, 0.30525538325309753], [40, 0.23250827193260193], [41, 0.1373147815465927], [42, 0.30254608392715454], [43, 0.38188832998275757], [44, 0.09584680199623108], [45, 0.2774045467376709], [46, 0.2911185324192047], [47, 0.2528980076313019], [48, 0.11149445921182632], [49, 0.4124988317489624], [50, 0.17310619354248047], [51, 0.1803002655506134], [52, 0.3396848142147064], [53, 0.2605871260166168], [54, 0.3109344244003296], [55, 0.1987147331237793], [56, 0.30300724506378174], [57, 0.31868261098861694], [58, 0.16095030307769775], [59, 0.2611759305000305], [60, 0.30019640922546387], [61, 0.3993357717990875], [62, 0.38013768196105957], [63, 0.12011045962572098], [64, 0.23857161402702332], [65, 0.31810933351516724], [66, 0.5412322878837585], [67, 0.47548094391822815], [68, 0.24770162999629974], [69, 0.11637412756681442], [70, 0.28100091218948364], [71, 0.15716396272182465], [72, 0.38699430227279663], [73, 0.13112056255340576], [74, 0.36577898263931274], [75, 0.25071805715560913], [76, 0.1723046600818634], [77, 0.2439686357975006]]}, {"test case number": 52, "context": "Equix is a company in Lexington, Kentucky, founded in 1984.

It offers an especially large gamut designed for use with photographic output in mind. The ProPhoto RGB color space encompasses over 90% of possible surface colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of likely occurring real-world surface colors documented by Pointer in 1980, making ProPhoto even larger than the Wide-gamut RGB color space. The ProPhoto RGB primaries were also chosen in order to minimize hue rotations associated with non-linear tone scale operations. One of the downsides to this color space is that approximately 13% of the representable colors are imaginary colors that do not exist and are not visible colors.The YCoCg color model is the color space formed from a simple transformation of an associated RGB color space into a 'luma' value (denoted as Y) and two 'chroma' values called 'chrominance green' (Cg) and 'chrominance orange' (Co). It is supported in video and image compression designs such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, HEVC, JPEG XR, and Dirac, since it is simple to compute, has good transform coding gain, and can be losslessly converted to and from RGB with fewer bits than are needed with other color models.Blue is the colour between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. Human eyes perceive blue when observing light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres. In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments, along with red and yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours. Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green. Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB colour model, used to create all the colours on the screen of a television or computer monitor.A color space is a specific organization of colors. In combination with physical device profiling, it allows for reproducible representations of color, in both analog and digital representations. A color space may be arbitrary, with particular colors assigned to a set of physical color swatches and corresponding assigned names or numbers such as with the Pantone collection, or structured mathematically, as with NCS System, Adobe RGB or sRGB. A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g. triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation. Adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite 'footprint', known as a gamut, and for a given color model this defines a color space. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model. When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see.HCL is designed to have characteristics of both cylindrical translations of RGB color space such as HSL and HSV and L*a*b* color space. HSL and HSV color spaces have the benefit of being perceptually uniform translations of the RGB color space, but their luminance variation does not match the way humans perceive color. Perceptually uniform translations of RGB colorspace do have the benefit of outperforming RGB in cases such as high noise environments. L*a*b colorspace does correspond to the three channels of human perception, but have poor hue constancy, especially in the blue range.Innocent Records was a pop record label created to cater to for EMI's Virgin Records more pop oriented acts. Following the success of the Spice Girls, Virgin Records decided to delve into the pop market. In doing so they poached Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records (famous for steering Take That's initial flagging sales, to a multi-platinum act). They let him launch his own Virgin Records offshoot. His first signing was Billie Piper, followed by Martine McCutcheon, along with several dance acts Todd Terry to name one. The label continued to thrive well into the mid-2000s with Atomic Kitten and Blue achieving Platinum sales.RGBA stands for red green blue alpha. While it is sometimes described as a color space, it is actually simply a use of the RGB color model, with extra alpha channel information. The color is RGB, and may belong to any RGB color space, but an integral alpha value as invented by Catmull and Smith between 1971 and 1972 enables alpha compositing. The inventors named alpha after the Greek letter in the classic linear interpolation formula '\u03b1' 'A' + (1 \u2212 '\u03b1') 'B' .Brown is a composite color. In the CMYK color model used in printing or painting, brown is made by combining red, black, and yellow, or red, yellow, and blue. In the RGB color model used to project colors onto television screens and computer monitors, brown is made by combining red and green, in specific proportions. The brown color is seen widely in nature, in wood, soil, human hair color, eye color and skin pigmentation. Brown is the color of dark wood or rich soil. According to public opinion surveys in Europe and the United States, brown is the least favorite color of the public; the color most often associated with plainness, the rustic, feces, and poverty.The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.An RGB color space is any additive color space based on the RGB color model. A particular RGB color space is defined by the three chromaticities of the red, green, and blue additive primaries, and can produce any chromaticity that is the triangle defined by those primary colors. The complete specification of an RGB color space also requires a white point chromaticity and a gamma correction curve. As of 2007, sRGB is by far the most commonly used RGB color space.", "modContext": "The ProPhoto RGB color space, also known as ROMM RGB (Reference Output Medium Metric), is an output referred RGB color space developed by Kodak. The ProPhoto RGB color space encompasses over 90% of possible surface colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of likely occurring real-world surface colors documented by Pointer in 1980, making ProPhoto even larger than the Wide-gamut RGB color space. The ProPhoto RGB primaries were also chosen in order to minimize hue rotations associated with non-linear tone scale operations. One of the downsides to this color space is that approximately 13% of the representable colors are imaginary colors that do not exist and are not visible colors.The YCoCg color model is the color space formed from a simple transformation of an associated RGB color space into a 'luma' value (denoted as Y) and two 'chroma' values called 'chrominance green' (Cg) and 'chrominance orange' (Co).Blue is the colour between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. Human eyes perceive blue when observing light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres. In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments, along with red and yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours. Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green. Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB colour model, used to create all the colours on the screen of a television or computer monitor.A color space is a specific organization of colors. In combination with physical device profiling, it allows for reproducible representations of color, in both analog and digital representations. A color space may be arbitrary, with particular colors assigned to a set of physical color swatches and corresponding assigned names or numbers such as with the Pantone collection, or structured mathematically, as with NCS System, Adobe RGB or sRGB. A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g. triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model. When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see.HCL is designed to have characteristics of both cylindrical translations of RGB color space such as HSL and HSV and L*a*b* color space. HSL and HSV color spaces have the benefit of being perceptually uniform translations of the RGB color space, but their luminance variation does not match the way humans perceive color. Perceptually uniform translations of RGB colorspace do have the benefit of outperforming RGB in cases such as high noise environments. L*a*b colorspace does correspond to the three channels of human perception, but have poor hue constancy, especially in the blue range. In doing so they poached Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records (famous for steering Take That's initial flagging sales, to a multi-platinum act). The label continued to thrive well into the mid-2000s with Atomic Kitten and Blue achieving Platinum sales.RGBA stands for red green blue alpha. While it is sometimes described as a color space, it is actually simply a use of the RGB color model, with extra alpha channel information. The color is RGB, and may belong to any RGB color space, but an integral alpha value as invented by Catmull and Smith between 1971 and 1972 enables alpha compositing. The inventors named alpha after the Greek letter in the classic linear interpolation formula '\u03b1' 'A' + (1 \u2212 '\u03b1') 'B' . In the CMYK color model used in printing or painting, brown is made by combining red, black, and yellow, or red, yellow, and blue. In the RGB color model used to project colors onto television screens and computer monitors, brown is made by combining red and green, in specific proportions.The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.

Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).

It was the first time that the Golden Globe Awards had created a separate category for animated films since its establishment. The nominations are announced in January and an awards ceremony is held later in the month. Initially, only three films are nominated for best animated film, in contrast to five nominations for the majority of other awards. The Pixar film 'Cars' was the first recipient of the award. The award for best animated film has subsequently been presented to six other Pixar films: 'Ratatouille' received the award in 2008, 'WALL-E' was the recipient in 2009, 'Up' received the award in 2010, 'Toy Story 3' won in 2011, 'Brave' won in 2013, and 'Inside Out' won in 2016. In 2012, 'Cars 2' lost to 'The Adventures of Tintin', in 2014, 'Monsters University' was the first not to be nominated and also in 2016, 'The Good Dinosaur' lost to 'Inside Out'.

However, trace fossils and paleopathology can give insight into dinosaur behavior. Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their habitat, computer simulations of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches. As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs. Gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for their young. There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles. The crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the marginocephalians, theropods and lambeosaurines, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism. Most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.Sanjay's Super Team is a computer-animated short film produced by Pixar Animation Studios.

On July 27, 2015, Governor Terry McAuliffe announced his appointment of Roush to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice LeRoy F. Millette, Jr. effective July 31, 2015. Under the Constitution of Virginia, this original interim appointment was to expire thirty days after the commencement of the next session of the Virginia General Assembly, unless the legislature elected her to a full twelve-year term. On August 17, 2015, the General Assembly convened in special session but failed to elect anyone to the full twelve-year term before the Senate of Virginia purported to adjourn sine die. The Constitution prohibits one chamber of the legislature from adjourning for more than three days without the consent of the other chamber. The Governor claims that this provision applies only to regular sessions of the General Assembly; the House of Delegates and most Senate Republicans claim it applies to special sessions as well, and that the Senate's adjournment was invalid because the House did not consent. Because there is legal uncertainty about whether the legislature was still in session, it is unclear whether the governor could fill the vacancy created when Justice Roush's original interim appointment expired on September 16, 2015.

The demon is also mentioned in some Talmudic legends; for instance, in the story of the construction of the Temple of Solomon. He was supposed by some Renaissance Christians to be the King of the Nine Hells. Asmodeus also is referred to as one of the seven princes of Hell. In Binsfeld's classification of demons, each one of these princes represents one of the seven deadly sins (Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, and Pride). Asmodeus is the demon of lust and is therefore responsible for twisting people's sexual desires, as seen in the book of Tobias especially.

The interval was first defined by the geologist Lardner Vanuxem, who derived the name from the village of Clinton in Oneida County, New York where several well exposed outcrops of these strata can be found. The Clinton Group and its lateral equivalents extend throughout much of the Appalachian Foreland Basin, a major structural and depositional province extending from New York to Alabama. The term has been employed in Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, though in many of these areas the same interval is referred to as the Rose Hill, Rockwood, or Red Mountain Formations. Historically the term 'Clinton' has also been assigned to several lower Silurian stratigraphic units in Ohio and Kentucky which are now known to be significantly older than the Clinton Group as it was originally defined. Many parts of this succession are richly fossiliferous, making the Clinton Group an important record of marine life during the early Silurian. Several economically valuable rock-types are found within this interval, though it is perhaps best known as a significant source of iron oreThe Hohokam ( ) were an ancient Native American culture centered in the present US state of Arizona. The Hohokam are one of the four major cultures of the American Southwest and northern Mexico in Southwestern archaeology. Considered part of the Oasisamerica tradition, the Hohokam established significant trading centers such as at Snaketown, and are considered to be the builders of the original canal system around the Phoenix metropolitan area, which the Mormon pioneers rebuilt when they settled the Lehi area of Mesa near Red Mountain. Variant spellings in current, official usage include Hobokam, Huhugam, and Huhukam.Mount McDowell (O'odham: S-weg\u012d Do\u02bcag, Yavapai: Wi:kawatha), more commonly referred to as Red Mountain, is located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Reservation, just north of Mesa, Arizona.

The oldest such group in the United States is The Civil War Round Table of Chicago, which was founded in 1941 and is based in Chicago, Illinois. The second and perhaps third oldest are the Civil War Round Table of Milwaukee (founded in 1947) and the Civil War Round Table of the District of Columbia (founded in 1951).

Though lesser known than The Texas Brigade, famous for their actions during the Battle of Gettysburg, the 'Terry Rangers' distinguished themselves at several battles during the Civil War. In four years of service, Terry's Texas Rangers fought in about 275 engagements in seven states. The regiment earned a reputation that ranked it among the most effective mounted regiments in the Western Theater of the American Civil War.The spillover of the Syrian Civil War is the impact of the Syrian Civil War in the Arab world. Since the first protests during the Arab Spring, the increasingly violent Syrian Civil War has been both a proxy war for the major Arab powers, Turkey and Iran, and a potential launching point for a wider regional war. Fears of the latter were realized when the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a Salafi Jihadist militant group and alleged former al-Qaeda affiliate, established itself in Syria in 2013, and later combined with the Iraqi Civil War into a single conflict the following year. The spillover of the Syrian Civil War is often dubbed as the Arab Winter.William Polk Hardeman (November 4, 1816 \u2013 April 8, 1898) was a Confederate States Army brigadier general during the American Civil War.

As the largest developing country in the world, China faces a severe digital divide, which exists not only between Mainland China and developed countries, but also among its own regions and social groups. Like many other indicators of development, wide gaps exist between Chinese IT 'haves and have nots.' The existence of these gaps is well established. Though published literature gives a general picture of the digital divide in China growing, along with other development measurements such as per capita GDP. In some cases, however, there is some evidence to suggest that the ICT gap may, in fact, be narrowing. This trend has implications on China's future development.Queen Tripurasundari (1794 - April 6, 1832) (also known as Lalit Tripura Sundari Devi, or Lalit Tripura Sundari Thapa) (Nepali: \u0930\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0932\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0938\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0930\u0940 ) was the acting regent of Nepal after the assassination of Rana Bahadur Shah, from 1806 to 1832.

It was earlier circulated in preprint. The problems involved have largely been resolved, with all but the 'telescope conjecture' being proved in later papers by others. The telescope conjecture is now generally believed not to be true, though there are some conflicting claims concerning it in the published literature, and is taken to be an open problem. Ravenel's conjectures exerted influence on the field through the founding of the approach of chromatic homotopy theory.The Decadent Movement was a late 19th-century artistic and literary movement, centered in Western Europe, that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality. The visual artist F\u00e9licien Rops's body of work and Joris-Karl Huysmans's novel 'Against Nature' (1884) are considered the prime examples of the decadent movement. It first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States. The movement was characterized by self-disgust, sickness at the world, general skepticism, delight in perversion and employment of crude humor and a belief in the superiority of human creativity over logic and the natural world.This page contains a list of magic tricks.

It was built in 1908 with money donated by John Dustin Archbold, a major benefactor of the university, who also funded the building of Archbold Stadium, just to the west of the gymnasium (now the site of the Carrier Dome). It served as the home to the men's basketball team until the building of the Manley Field House in 1962, with the exception of the time from January, 1947 to 1949. This was due to a large fire which gutted most of the building.

Rockefeller after 1896 left business matters to Archbold while he pursued his philanthropy; as vice president Archbold effectively ran Standard Oil until his death in 1916. Inspired by Rockefeller's policies, Archbold's main goals were stabilization, efficiency, and minimizing waste in refining and distributing petroleum products. The company was broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911 into three dozen smaller operations, Archbold became president of the largest one, Standard Oil of New Jersey.Branch Rickey Arena is a 2,300-seat multi-purpose arena at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, located centrally on campus and adjacent to Edwards Gymnasium.

The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population. This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in primary care. Primary Care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice. Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day. Many patients present with mental health care needs whose symptomology may overlap with medical disorders and which may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms. In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (e.g. stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change, through behavioral intervention, that can improve outcomes for these health problems. Over 50% of medical visits to primary care clinics today are related to chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity). As we learn more and more about the contributing factors to the development and maintenance of these medical problems, there is growing evidence that the PCBH model affords us the opportunity for early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems. Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians. The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint. BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients\u2019 changing needs In this review the terms Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation and Behavioral Health Consultation will be used interchangeably.Bellaflor 'Bella' J.

Since the Nazi Party was by its very nature a paramilitary organization, by the time of the Second World War, several systems of paramilitary ranks had come into existence for both the Nazi Party itself and the various Nazi paramilitary organizations.The National Socialist Flyers Corps (German: 'Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps' ; NSFK) was a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party that was founded April 15, 1937 as a successor to the German Air Sports Association; the latter had been active during the years when a German air force was forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The NSFK organization was based closely on the organization of the 'Sturmabteilung' (SA) and maintained a system of paramilitary ranks closely associated with the SA. A similar group was the National Socialist Motor Corps. During the early years of its existence, the NSFK conducted military aviation training in gliders and private airplanes.Jos\u00e9 Vicente Casta\u00f1o Gil aka El Profe (born July 2, 1957) is a Colombian paramilitary former leader of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing Colombian paramilitary organization.

Tachikawa Aircraft Company was dissolved after the war and the company took the name Fuji Precision Industries. It diversified into automobiles, producing an electric car, the Tama, in 1946, named for the region the company originated in, Tama, using the Ohta series PC/PD platform. The company changed its name to Prince in 1952 to honor Prince Akihito's formal investiture as Crown Prince. In 1954 they changed their name back to Fuji Precision Industries, and in 1961 changed the name back again to Prince Motor Company. In 1966, they became part of Nissan, while the Prince organization remained in existence inside Nissan, as 'Nissan Prince Store' in Japan until Nissan consolidated the Prince dealership network into 'Nissan Blue Stage' in 1999.The Nissan Cefiro is a luxury car that was produced by the Japanese automobile manufacture Nissan Motors. Introduced to Japan in 1988 as the A31 series four-door sedan, and exclusive to Japanese Nissan dealerships called 'Nissan Satio Store', the Cefiro initially shared its basic rear-wheel drive chassis with the Nissan Laurel (C33), (F31), and the Nissan Skyline (R32). After production of the A31 stopped, the Cefiro dropped its sporting pretensions and essentially saw the standalone Cefiro model deleted from the lineup. This came with the introduction of the A32 and A33 Maxima, which took on the Cefiro nameplace in the Japanese domestic market although it bore no mechanical relation to the A31. The A32 and A33 closely follow the lineage of the J30 Maxima which was produced at the same time as the A31 Cefiro. The second generation (A32) and third (A33) generation Cefiro saw the switching to the front-wheel drive layout with a V6 engine. In Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand and Australia, the A32 and A33 series models were sold new as the Nissan Maxima. It is also badge engineered as the Renault Samsung SM5.Bashneft is a Russian oil company formed by the transfer of the oil related assets of the Soviet oil ministry in Bashkortostan to the regional government of the Republic of Bashkortostan by Boris Yeltsin. It was then privatized during 2002-3 by Murtaza Rakhimov, the president of Bashkortostan, an ally of Yeltsin's, with a controlling interest in Bashkir Capital, a holding company controlled by Rakhimov's son, Ural Rakhimov. In 2009 a controlling interest in Bashneft was acquired for $2 billion by Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov and placed in his holding company, Sistema, but in July 2014 he was jailed and 72% of Sistema's interest in Bashneft seized by the Russian government. Following seizure of the company in December 2014 Yevtushenkov was released from jail, 'charges not proven,' but Ural Rakhimov was reported to have fled the country. It is one of the larger producers of oil products in the country. The company operates 140 oil and natural gas fields in Russia and has an annual oil production of 16 million tonnes.

It features 73 teams' countries. Each team enters a 'Regional Qualifying Round Final' where it plays a team it actually played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. For example: Spain would face Yugoslavia, an opponent it actually faced in its qualifying group. Or Italy would face Russia, an opponent Italy faced in the UEFA play-offs. If the player beats the opponent, it goes to a group much like the real life World Cup. In fact, the team faces opponents that were actually in its group. For example: Mexico would face the Netherlands, Belgium and South Korea. It is a re-make of 'Super Sidekicks 3'. However, animations and designs were exactly the same. The only difference is teams to reflect the World Cup, kits again to reflect the World Cup, and players to resemble squads from the World Cup (teams that did not qualify use line-ups from friendly games and qualifiers). Its slogan is 'We got the kick'.WJKD (99.7 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Jack FM format. Licensed to Vero Beach, Florida, USA, the station is currently licensed to Vero Beach Broadcasters, LLC. 99.7 went on the air on March 27, 1992, as WWDO FM. From 1995-2001, the station consisted of a country music format, and branded itself as 'Panther Country 99.7,' with the call letters, WPAW. On March 5, 2001, the station changed to an 1980s hits format. It rebranded itself as '99.7 GNX,' to reflect the new call letters WGNX, and its slogan ''The music of Generation X'.' In 2003, WGNX added a few hits from the 1970s and 1990s to its playlist, making it more like a variety station, although its music format continued to be, for the most part, the same. In 2004, WGNX tried a daring move by starting up a new radio show that featured alternative rock music on Saturday nights. However, the idea did not go over well, and the station cancelled the show. In December, 2006, WGNX rebranded itself as '997 Jack FM,' and changed its call letters to WJKD. Jack FM's playlist features hit music across multiple genres (mostly pop and rock) from the 1960s to present-day. Their slogan, 'Playing What We Want,' promotes Jack FM as having a larger playlist with more variety than most commercial radio stations, thus giving the station a reason not to take requests from its listeners.John Bachmann, Sr. (1814\u20131896) was a Swiss-born lithographer and artist best known for his bird's-eye views, especially of New York City. He was a journeyman lithographic artist in Switzerland and Paris until 1847. His first known American print (credited to 'C Bachmann' as artist and 'J Bachmann' as publisher) appeared in 1848, a view from an imagined point above Union Square in New York, looking south toward The Battery. In 1849 and 1850, he created and published a series of American views, including views of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, New Orleans and Havana. Both directly copied and used as a primary source by other lithographers at home and in Europe, these were the first major bird's eye views (drawn from an imagined perspective), as opposed to panoramic views (views drawn directly from the artists experience) in the United States (smaller views had appeared as early as the 1820s).Peter Daou is the creator of Verrit, the prior chief executive of Shareblue, and a member of the band The Daou.Yeh Dil Maange More! is an advertising slogan coined for Pepsi at JWT by Anuja Chauhan in 1998.

Created by Peter Burke, it focuses on the nature of peoples' identities and the relationship between their identities and their behavior within the realm of their social structure. The identities of the individual are rooted in their social structure. Identity Control Theory was created based on traditional symbolic interaction views where people choose their own behaviors and how their behaviors correspond to the meanings of their identity. One of the main aspects ICT deals with is how individuals view their own identities and respond to the reactions to their identities of those around them. When an individual is acting according to the identity control theory they reflect on the identity they display and how others approve or disapprove of their identity. If the individual does not like the responses of others they will look at how they can change their views of their identity or their identity towards themselves to produce a positive outcome. One of the main benefits of this theory is how negative feelings can be prevented by individuals and by those around them. The people around someone who is displaying a certain identity have the ability to be more sensitive and prevent negative feelings if they understand identity control theory because they know what will bring out a negative response. On the other hand, the individual can prevent negative feelings that coincide with the teachings of identity control theory if they understand these teachings and can apply them to their own lives.Peter Kennard (born 17 February 1949) is a London born and based photomontage artist and Senior Research Reader in Photography, Art and the Public Domain at the Royal College of Art.

The project is to replace the \u2018missing link\u2019 between Robertsbridge, a station on the Tonbridge to Hastings mainline, and Bodiam on the Kent and East Sussex Railway, a heritage railway which operates from Bodiam to Tenterden. A charity supported by a society of volunteers are attempting to re-establish the railway link. The RVR began by reinstating the first few hundred yards of line eastwards from Robertsbridge, and also a short stretch westwards from Bodiam. In 2010, the latter section was further extended to reach Junction Road. In summer 2011 work began at Robertsbridge to extend further eastwards to Northbridge Street, which entailed the rebuilding of five bridges. By June 2012, this further extension was also completed. In September 2013, a Gala weekend at Robertsbridge marked the progress to date and the start of the next phase - the re-instatement of the section between Northbridge Street and Junction Road, for which statutory permissions are being sought. While the RVR does not yet feature regular passenger trains, the base at Robertsbridge houses a small shop and visitor centre open to the public each Sunday, utilising a building formerly used as the London terminus of the Orient Express. There is also a small collection of historic railway vehicles in various stages of preservation.Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII (Japanese: \u30d3\u30d5\u30a9\u30a2 \u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30b7\u30b9 -\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fcVII- , Hepburn: Bifoa Kuraishisu -Fainaru Fantaj\u012b Sebun- ) is an action role-playing video game developed by Square Enix and originally released for the FOMA mobile service on September 24, 2004.

The junction of these two rivers could be seen from the site. This site was first visited by Marshall Williams in 1968 at the suggestion of the site\u2019s landowner, Joe Bell, who had discovered various artifacts while the site was being regularly plowed. Because of Interstate construction, Marshall Williams and Mark Williams discovered this site during surface surveys and excavations of the plowed areas. The site was excavated and analyzed by Mark Williams as part of his PhD dissertation. During the 1969 excavations, four areas within the site were designated for excavation. In Areas 1-3 various five foot square units were excavated. No excavations were done in Area 4 in 1969. Large quantities of small potsherds were discovered during these excavations, and they ranged from the Duvall Phase in Area 1 to Bell Phase in Areas 2-4. As part of the 1969 excavations, a road grading machine took off the topsoil of twelve strips on the site. This uncovered Features 1 and 2, and they were completely excavated. In 1977, the site was revisited by Marshall Williams and Mark Williams.

Most of the work centered on Area 2 or the Bell Phase portion of the site. The Bell Phase portion of this site was probably no more the 1.5 acres . Because of time constraints, only 17 of 55 features were excavated, and no more than a handful of the 1100 posts were excavated.

It can be of Jewish, English, French, German, Dutch, Irish, Welsh, Cornish, Breton, and other origins. It is derived from the Hebrew personal name 'Avraham', borne by the biblical patriarch Abraham, revered by Jews as a founding father of the Jewish people (Gen. 11-25), and by Muslims as founder of all Semitic peoples (see Abraham). The name is explained in Genesis 17:5 as being derived from the Hebrew 'av hamon goyim' 'father of a multitude of nations'. It was commonly used as a given name among Christians in the Middle Ages, and has always been a popular Jewish given name. The English name 'Abram' is often a short form of Abraham, but it can also be a shortened version of 'Adburgham', which comes from a place name. As an Irish name, it was adopted as an approximation (in sound, not meaning) of the Gaelic name 'Mac an Bhreitheamhan' 'son of the judge'. The German name 'Brahm' is often a short form of Abraham, but it can also be a topographic name signifying someone who lived near a bramble thicket (from the Middle High German 'br\u0101me'). The name 'Braham' has been used as an Anglicization of both Abraham and its patronymic Abrahams by Ashkenazi Jews in the British Isles (see John Braham). Abraham has also been used as an Anglicization of the equivalent Arabic surname 'Ibr\u0101h\u012bm' (see Ibrahim (name)).As this, O Lord, is the command of your Only-Begotten Son, that we share in the commemoration of your saints, graciously accord, O Lord, to remember all the saints who have pleased you since the beginning: our holy fathers the patriarchs, the prophets, the apostles, the preachers, the evangelists, the martyrs, the confessors and all the spirits of the righteous who were consummated in the faith.

He contributed to the modernist avant-garde and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for 'Ulysses' (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer's 'Odyssey' are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, perhaps most prominently stream of consciousness. Other well-known works are the short-story collection 'Dubliners' (1914), and the novels 'A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' (1916) and 'Finnegans Wake' (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.Finnegans Wake is a work of avant-garde comic fiction by Irish writer James Joyce. It is significant for its experimental style and reputation as one of the most difficult works of fiction in the English language. Written in Paris over a period of seventeen years and published in 1939, two years before the author's death, 'Finnegans Wake' was Joyce's final work. The entire book is written in a largely idiosyncratic language, which blends standard English lexical items and neologistic multilingual puns and portmanteau words to unique effect. Many critics believe the technique was Joyce's attempt to recreate the experience of sleep and dreams. Owing to the work's expansive linguistic experiments, stream of consciousness writing style, literary allusions, free dream associations, and abandonment of narrative conventions, 'Finnegans Wake' remains largely unread by the general public.The Waywords and Meansigns Opendoor Edition debuted in 2017 as a part of the Waywords and Meansigns project setting James Joyce's 'Finnegans Wake' to music.

The first major text to provide an in-depth analysis of 'Finnegans Wake' (James Joyce's final novel), 'A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake' is considered by many scholars to be a seminal work on the text. The term 'monomyth', which Campbell used to describe his journey of the hero in his book, 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces', came from 'Finnegans Wake.'A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is the first novel by Irish writer James Joyce. A K\u00fcnstlerroman in a modernist style, it traces the religious and intellectual awakening of young Stephen Dedalus, a fictional alter ego of Joyce and an allusion to Daedalus, the consummate craftsman of Greek mythology. Stephen questions and rebels against the Catholic and Irish conventions under which he has grown, culminating in his self-exile from Ireland to Europe. The work uses techniques that Joyce developed more fully in 'Ulysses' (1922) and 'Finnegans Wake' (1939).Finn's Hotel is a posthumously-published collection of ten short narrative pieces written by Irish author James Joyce.

The band was founded in 1955 by Carlos Colorado in the state of Tabasco, modeled after an earlier Cuban band called Sonora Matancera. However, the band created its own style. In 1960, comic actor Jes\u00fas \u201cPalillo\u201d Mart\u00ednez helped the band play in Mexico City and get a professional record deal under the name of Sonora Santanera. From that time until 1986, the band changed members, but remained focused on Carlos Colorado, the sole musical arranger for the group. Colorado died in a bus accident in 1986, causing some members to split off and form another orchestra called Los Santaneros. The remaining members changed name to Internacional Sonora Santanera. Since the 1980s, little of the band\u2019s sound changed although members continued to do so. In the 2000s, more bands appeared using the name of Sonora Santanera as part of their names, leading the orchestra to pursue legal actions and another name change in 2007 to the current name of 'La \u00danica Internacional Sonora Santanera'.Enamtila () is a Sumerian term meaning 'house of life' or possibly 'house of creation'. It was a sanctuary dedicated to Enlil, likely to have been located within the Ekur at Nippur during the Akkadian Empire. It also referred to various other temples including those to later versions of Enlil; Marduk and Bel as well as one to Ea. It was likely another name for Ehursag, a temple dedicated to Shulgi in Ur. A hymn to Nanna suggests the link ''To Ehursag, the house of the king (we go), to the Enamtila of prince Shulgi we go!'' Another reference in the Inanna - Dunmuzi text translated by Samuel Noah Kramer references the king's palace by this name and possibly makes references to the 'sacred marriage': ''In the Enamtila, the house of the king, his wife dwelt with him in joy, in the Enamtila, the house of the king, Inanna dwelt with him in joy. Inanna, rejoicing in his house ...''. A fire is reported to have broken out next to the Enamtila in a Babylonian astronomical diary dated to the third century BC. The Enamtila is also referred to as a palace of Ibbi-Sin at Ur in the Lament for Sumer and Ur, ''Its king sat immobilised in his own palace. Ibbi-Suen was sitting in anguish in his own palace. In E-namtila, his place of delight, he wept bitterly. The flood dashing a hoe on the ground was levelling everything.''A code name or cryptonym is a word or name used, sometimes clandestinely, to refer to another name, word, project or person. Names are often used for military purposes, or in espionage. They may also be used in industrial counter-industrial espionage to protect secret projects and the like from business rivals, or to give names to projects whose marketing name has not yet been determined. Another reason for the use of names and phrases in the military is that they transmit with a lower level of cumulative errors over a walkie-talkie or radio link than actual names.The Hanwell Band was a brass band formed in Hanwell in 1891. It was first known as the Hanwell Town Band but after success in competition it was renamed the Hanwell Prize Band Another competition win in 1913 in Tottenham expanded the name to the Hanwell Silver Prize Band. In 1979, sponsorship by Roneo Vickers resulted in another name change to the Roneo Vickers Band but the company soon folded. The final name was then the Hanwell Band but the band did not long survive the loss of sponsorship.Chunwei () is an ethnonym for the most ancient nomadic tribes that invaded China during legendary times. A Chinese Classical scholar and the first President of the Imperial Nanking University, Wei Zhao (204\u2013273), commented, identificating the name Chunwei with the name of the Huns: \u201cDuring the Han (206 BC-220 AD) they (the Huns) were called Xiongnu \u5308\u5974, and the Hunyu \u8477\u7ca5 is just another name for the same people, and similarly, the Xunyu \u736f\u7ca5 is just another transcription of Chunwei\u2019s \u6df3\u7dad, their ancestor\u2019s name\u201d.A Brilliant Genocide is a 2016 documentary film produced by Atlantic Star Productions. The purpose of the film is to reveal atrocities committed against the Acholi people by the Government of Uganda, and its President Yoweri Museveni, under the guise of crushing a rebellion by Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The film is a counterpoint to the 2012 documentary short film 'Kony 2012'. It was directed by Ebony Butler.In Irish mythology, Nechtan was the father and/or husband of Boann, eponymous goddess of the River Boyne. Elsewhere her husband is named as Elcmar. He may be Nuada under another name, or his cult may have been replaced by that of Nuada; others maintain that Nechtan may be another name for the Dagda. His inhabited the otherworldly S\u00edd Nechtain, the mythological form of Carbury Hill. In the Dindsenchas Nechtan is described as the husband of Boann and the son of Nuadu.Sua Ghin Gnua is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Thailand, formerly known as Siam. Another name for the game is Tigers and Oxen. It is a hunt game played on a 5x5 square grid with only orthogonal lines. One player plays the three tigers, and the other player plays the twelve oxen. The board is empty in the beginning. Players first drop their pieces onto the board, and then are able to move them. The tigers can capture the oxen by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque, but the oxen attempt to elude and at the same time hem in the tiger. Sua Ghin Gnua most resembles the tiger hunt games (or tiger games) such as Bagh-Chal, Rimau-rimau, Main Tapal Empat, Catch the Hare, and Adugo since they all use a 5 x 5 square grid. But tiger games technically consist of a standard Alquerque board which is a 5 x 5 square grid with several diagonal lines criss-crossing through it which are completely missing in Sua Ghin Gnua. There are however some variants of Catch the Hare which have missing diagonal lines also. Another game that resembles Sua Ghin Gnua is from Myanmar called Tiger and Buffaloes which is a hunt game consisting of a 4 x 4 square grid with no diagonal lines. Myanmar happens to border Thailand geographically so there might be a historical connection between the two games. Another game from Myanmar is Lay Gwet Kyah that is presumed to be similar to Sua Ghin Gnua. Sua Ghin Gnua was briefly described by Stewart Culin, in his book 'Chess and Playing Cards: Catalogue of Games and Implements for Divination Exhibited by the United States National Museum in Connection with the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology of the University of Pennsylvania at the Cotton States and International Exposition, Atlanta, Georgia 1895' (1898). It's also briefly mentioned by H.J.R. Murray in his book 'A History of Chess' (1913). It was also described by R.C. Bell, in his book 'Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations' (1969).The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), also known as the Lord's Resistance Movement, is a rebel group and heterodox Christian cult which operates in northern Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Originally known as the United Holy Salvation Army and Uganda Christian Army/Movement, its stated goals include establishment of multi-party democracy, ruling Uganda according to the Ten Commandments, and Acholi nationalism, though in practice 'the LRA is not motivated by any identifiable political agenda, and its military strategy and tactics reflect this'. It appears to largely function as a personality cult of its leader Joseph Kony, a self-declared prophet whose leadership has earned him the nickname 'Africa's David Koresh'.", "modContext": " Daisy knew this was necessary.

Another reason for the use of names and phrases in the military is that they transmit with a lower level of cumulative errors over a walkie-talkie or radio link than actual names.The Hanwell Band was a brass band formed in Hanwell in 1891.

A Chinese Classical scholar and the first President of the Imperial Nanking University, Wei Zhao (204\u2013273), commented, identificating the name Chunwei with the name of the Huns: \u201cDuring the Han (206 BC-220 AD) they (the Huns) were called Xiongnu \u5308\u5974, and the Hunyu \u8477\u7ca5 is just another name for the same people, and similarly, the Xunyu \u736f\u7ca5 is just another transcription of Chunwei\u2019s \u6df3\u7dad, their ancestor\u2019s name\u201d.A Brilliant Genocide is a 2016 documentary film produced by Atlantic Star Productions. The purpose of the film is to reveal atrocities committed against the Acholi people by the Government of Uganda, and its President Yoweri Museveni, under the guise of crushing a rebellion by Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The film is a counterpoint to the 2012 documentary short film 'Kony 2012'. It was directed by Ebony Butler.In Irish mythology, Nechtan was the father and/or husband of Boann, eponymous goddess of the River Boyne. Elsewhere her husband is named as Elcmar. He may be Nuada under another name, or his cult may have been replaced by that of Nuada; others maintain that Nechtan may be another name for the Dagda. His inhabited the otherworldly S\u00edd Nechtain, the mythological form of Carbury Hill. In the Dindsenchas Nechtan is described as the husband of Boann and the son of Nuadu. Another name for the game is Tigers and Oxen. One player plays the three tigers, and the other player plays the twelve oxen. The tigers can capture the oxen by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque, but the oxen attempt to elude and at the same time hem in the tiger. Sua Ghin Gnua most resembles the tiger hunt games (or tiger games) such as Bagh-Chal, Rimau-rimau, Main Tapal Empat, Catch the Hare, and Adugo since they all use a 5 x 5 square grid. There are however some variants of Catch the Hare which have missing diagonal lines also. Another game that resembles Sua Ghin Gnua is from Myanmar called Tiger and Buffaloes which is a hunt game consisting of a 4 x 4 square grid with no diagonal lines. Myanmar happens to border Thailand geographically so there might be a historical connection between the two games. Another game from Myanmar is Lay Gwet Kyah that is presumed to be similar to Sua Ghin Gnua. Sua Ghin Gnua was briefly described by Stewart Culin, in his book 'Chess and Playing Cards: Catalogue of Games and Implements for Divination Exhibited by the United States National Museum in Connection with the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology of the University of Pennsylvania at the Cotton States and International Exposition, Atlanta, Georgia 1895' (1898). It's also briefly mentioned by H.J.R. Murray in his book 'A History of Chess' (1913). It was also described by R.C. Bell, in his book 'Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations' (1969).The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), also known as the Lord's Resistance Movement, is a rebel group and heterodox Christian cult which operates in northern Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Originally known as the United Holy Salvation Army and Uganda Christian Army/Movement, its stated goals include establishment of multi-party democracy, ruling Uganda according to the Ten Commandments, and Acholi nationalism, though in practice 'the LRA is not motivated by any identifiable political agenda, and its military strategy and tactics reflect this'. It appears to largely function as a personality cult of its leader Joseph Kony, a self-declared prophet whose leadership has earned him the nickname 'Africa's David Koresh'.", "question": "what is

The group was started by Ezra Cline and Curly Ray Cline and was originally named 'Cousin Ezra and the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers'. The Clines came from a large family consisting of musically talented people. Ray and Charlie's father, Charlie, was a talented banjo player and the women in the family, Geraldine and Bobbi, were great singers. For reasons unknown, Bobbi and Geraldine never joined the band on the road but often joined in at home, especially when notable Country singers, such as Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, and Hank Williams, came visiting. None of them ever had a music lesson yet excelled on every instrument they touched. Natives of the Gilbert Creek region of southern West Virginia, Cousin Ezra, along with brothers Ireland (Lazy Ned) and Curly Ray Cline, were part of the original Lonesome Pine Fiddlers from about 1938, a group that worked on radio at WHIS Bluefield, West Virginia. During World War II, Ned was killed in action. When the Pine Fiddlers resumed regular daily broadcasts, Charlie, who played multiple instruments, joined them on a regular basis. Charlie returned to the Fiddlers briefly before becoming a member of Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys. During 1952-1955, Charlie worked off and on with Monroe, recording some 38 songs, all on Decca. It has been said that he played every instrument at one time or another in the Monroe group except mandolin. Charlie spent most of 1953 back with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers working at WJR radio in Detroit. When Ezra brought the band to Pikeville, Kentucky, in November, Charlie rejoined Bill Monroe. In 1954, Charlie did a session, playing lead guitar, with the Stanley Brothers and also another one on RCA with the Fiddlers, although he was not otherwise working with them at the time. He also worked briefly as a sideman with the Osborne Brothers, although he did not record with them. By 1958, Charlie (electric lead guitar) and his wife, Lee (electric bass), had rejoined Ezra and Curly Ray in the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers, who were experimenting with a more modern sound and working a TV show in Huntington, West Virginia, in addition to daily radio in Pikeville. In his later years, Charlie was with the Stanley Brothers. Curly Ray also played with the Stanley Brothers at a different time as their fiddler. Curly Ray was one of the best fiddlers in Bluegrass.

After the English Civil War, Charles II assigned New Jersey as a proprietary colony to be held jointly by Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton. Eventually, the collection of land fees, or quit-rents, from colonists proved inadequate for colonial profitability. Sir George Carteret sold his share of the colony to the Quakers in 1673. Following the sale, the land was divided into East and West Jersey. In 1681, West Jersey adopted a constitution. In 1683, East Jersey adopted one as well. In 1702, the colonies were united again under Anne, Queen of Great Britain, and adopted a constitution in 1776.The Province of Pennsylvania, also known as the Pennsylvania Colony, was founded in English North America by William Penn on March 4, 1681 as dictated in a royal charter granted by King Charles II. The name Pennsylvania, which translates roughly as 'Penn's Woods', was created by combining the Penn surname (in honor of William's father, Admiral Sir William Penn) with the Latin word 'sylvania', meaning 'forest land.' The Province of Pennsylvania was one of the two major Restoration colonies, the other being the Province of Carolina. The proprietary colony's charter remained in the hands of the Penn family until the American Revolution, when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was created and became one of the original thirteen states.The Province of New York (1664\u20131776) was a British proprietary colony and later royal colony on the northeast coast of North America. As one of the Thirteen Colonies, New York achieved independence and worked with the others to found the United States.Charter colony is one of three classes of colonial government established in the 17th century English colonies in North America, the other classes being proprietary colony and royal colony. The colonies of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts Bay were charter colonies. In a charter colony, Britain granted a charter to the colonial government establishing the rules under which the colony was to be governed. The charters of Rhode Island and Connecticut granted the colonists significantly more political liberty than other colonies. Rhode Island and Connecticut continued to use their colonial charters as their State constitutions after the American Revolution.Canada first came under British rule with the Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France, of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire. Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas. With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada. Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada, which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation. Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949. Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act, subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom.The Stamp Act Congress or First Congress of the American Colonies was a meeting held between October 7 and 25, 1765 in New York City, consisting of representatives from some of the British colonies in North America; it was the first gathering of elected representatives from several of the American colonies to devise a unified protest against new British taxation. Parliament had passed the Stamp Act, which required the use of specially stamped paper for legal documents, playing cards, calendars, newspapers and dice for virtually all business in the colonies, and was going into effect on November 1.The Province of New Jersey was one of the Middle Colonies of Colonial America and became the U.S. state of New Jersey in 1776. The province had originally been settled by Europeans as part of New Netherland, but came under English rule after the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664, becoming a proprietary colony. The English then renamed the province after the Isle of Jersey in the English Channel. The Dutch Republic reasserted control for a brief period in 1673\u20131674. After that it consisted of two political divisions, East Jersey and West Jersey, until they were united as a royal colony in 1702. The original boundaries of the province were slightly larger than the current state, extending into a part of the present state of New York, until the border was finalized in 1773.The New York \u2013 New Jersey Line War (also known as the N.J. Line War) refers to a series of skirmishes and raids that took place for over half a century between 1701 and 1765 at the disputed border between two American colonies, the Province of New York and the Province of New Jersey.A proprietary colony was a type of British colony mostly in North America and the Caribbean in the 17th century. In the British Empire, all land belonged to the ruler, and it was his prerogative to divide. Therefore, all colonial properties were partitioned by royal charter into one of four types: proprietary, royal, joint stock, or covenant. King Charles II used the proprietary solution to reward allies and focus his own attention on Britain itself. He offered his friends colonial charters which facilitated private investment and colonial self-government. The charters made the proprietor the effective ruler, albeit one ultimately responsible to English law and the king. Charles II gave New Netherland to his younger brother The Duke of York, who named it New York. He gave an area to William Penn who named it Pennsylvania.The Stamp Act of 1765 (short title 'Duties in American Colonies Act 1765'; 5 George III, c. 12) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain that imposed a direct tax on the colonies of British America and required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London, carrying an embossed revenue stamp. Printed materials included legal documents, magazines, playing cards, newspapers, and many other types of paper used throughout the colonies. Like previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money. The purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America after the British victory in the Seven Years' War and its North American theater of the French and Indian War. The Americans said that there was no military need for the soldiers because there were no foreign enemies on the continent, and the Americans had always protected themselves against Indians. They suggested that it was actually a matter of British patronage to surplus British officers and career soldiers who should be paid by London.", "modContext": "Originally, the state of New Jersey was a single British colony, the Province of New Jersey.
