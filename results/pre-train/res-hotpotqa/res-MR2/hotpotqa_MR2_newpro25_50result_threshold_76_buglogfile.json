There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905. In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan. AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building. In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races. It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\". Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations. Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout. During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces. Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled. The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort. The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort. As members returned after the War a new location was searched for. This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ. They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time. The space? Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City. Here the layout was built. It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa. It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.

{"test case number": 40, "context": "The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier. Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier. There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier. It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry. These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.The Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog of the smooth-haired terrier type.A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants. These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier. These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners. Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier.The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog. It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail. The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton.The Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0439, \u0422\u043e\u0439\u0447\u0438\u043a ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier. There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat. The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier. Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \"Terrier\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010. The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia.The viol , viola da gamba ] , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings. Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly. Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings. Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods. Early ancestors include the Arabic \"rebab\" and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian \"viole\" and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish \"vihuela\", a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone).The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds. The type originated in Scotland and Northern England. The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout. Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types. Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the AKC has a breed they call \"Collie\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports. They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity.The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland. The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie. It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes. Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.The Toy Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog, categorized as a terrier. The breed was bred down in size in North America from the Manchester Terrier, and is placed in the Toy Group by the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club (the Manchester Terrier is placed in the Terrier Group.) Neither the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale nor The Kennel Club recognize a Toy variety of the Manchester Terrier.Florence Nagle (26 October 1894\u00a0\u2013 30 October 1988) was a trainer and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of pedigree dogs, and an active feminist. Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, and went on to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions. Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle. She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions. The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters.", "modContext": "The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.

The libretto is based on an incident mentioned in Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". The work is the third and final part of Puccini's \"Il trittico\" (The Triptych)\u2014three one-act operas with contrasting themes, originally written to be presented together. Although it continues to be performed with one or both of the other \"trittico\" operas, \"Gianni Schicchi\" is now more frequently staged either alone or with short operas by other composers.

The Hornets were first established in 1988 as an expansion team, but relocated to New Orleans following the 2001\u201302 season. In 2004, a new expansion team, the Charlotte Bobcats, was established. After 10 seasons as the Bobcats, the team changed its name to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014\u201315 season, a year after the New Orleans franchise relinquished the Hornets name and renamed itself the Pelicans. In addition to re-inheriting the Hornets name from New Orleans, the Charlotte franchise reclaimed the history and records of the original 1988\u20132002 Hornets, effectively becoming a continuation of the original franchise. The Charlotte Sting had drafted three Lady Raiders, more than any other WNBA franchise: Michi Atkins, in the WNBA Elite Draft, and Angie Braziel and Jia Perkins during the college draft.The 1992\u201393 NBA season was the fifth season for the Charlotte Hornets in the National Basketball Association. In the 1992 NBA draft, the Hornets selected center Alonzo Mourning out of Georgetown with the second overall pick. With the addition of Mourning, along with second-year star Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues, the Hornets struggled around . The team became the first of the four expansion franchises of the late 1980s to win a playoff series, when Mourning sunk a 20 ft jumper at the buzzer in Game 4 of the first round playoff series against the 4th-seeded Boston Celtics.The original Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) were established in 1988 as an expansion team, based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The team's roster was filled with unprotected players at the 1988 NBA Expansion Draft, and five days later the Hornets made their first picks out of college players at the 1988 NBA draft. The Hornets remained in Charlotte for 14 seasons before relocating to New Orleans in 2002. Two years after the Hornets' departure, the Charlotte Bobcats were established in 2004. The franchise's name was changed back to the Hornets at the conclusion of the 2013\u201314 season, one year after the team in Louisiana renamed itself the New Orleans Pelicans. The history and records of the original Charlotte Hornets were conveyed to the newly named Charlotte Hornets. She played for the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters basketball team from 1998 to 2002. Walker was drafted as the 20th overall pick by the Detroit Shock in the 2002 WNBA Draft. As a member of the Shock, she won the 2003 WNBA Championship. On July 3, 2005, Walker signed with the Charlotte Sting. After the Sting franchise folded, Walker was drafted by Los Angeles Sparks as the 12th pick in the dispersal draft on January 8, 2007.The 2003 WNBA Season was the Women's National Basketball Association's seventh season. It was first season in which teams either folded or relocated, as well as the first to have teams that were not co-owned with NBA teams.

They are members of the National Basketball Association (NBA), playing in the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference. The original Charlotte Hornets franchise played in Charlotte from 1988\u20132002 before relocating to New Orleans, Louisiana and becoming the New Orleans Hornets. A new franchise, the \"Charlotte Bobcats\", began play in the 2004\u201305 season. The team played for ten seasons as the Bobcats before adopting the Hornets name for the 2014\u201315 season. The Hornets name was left available after the New Orleans Hornets became the New Orleans Pelicans. As part of a deal between the Bobcats, Hornets and NBA, the renamed Hornets reclaimed the original Hornets' history and records from 1988 to 2002, while all of the Hornets' records from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans. As a result, the Hornets are now reckoned as having suspended operations after the 2001\u201302 season before returning as the Bobcats in 2004; This has allowed all of Charlotte's NBA history to be recognized under one single franchise.The Charlotte Hornets are an American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Organised by the English Football League (EFL), it is open to any club within the top four levels of the English football league system \u2013 92 clubs in total \u2013 comprising the top level Premier League, and the three divisions of the English Football League's own league competition (Championship, League One and League Two).Springfield Park was a multi-purpose stadium in Wigan, Greater Manchester. It was the home ground of Wigan Athletic F.C. until the club moved to the new JJB Stadium (now DW Stadium) after the 1998\u201399 season. At its largest, the stadium held 40,000.

{"test case number": 146, "context": "Kargil War Memorial, also known as the Vijaypath, is a war memorial built by the Indian Army, located in Dras, in the foothills of the Tololing Hill. The memorial is located about 5\u00a0km from the city centre across the Tiger Hill. It is located on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway 1D. The memorial is in the memory of the soldiers and officers of the Indian Army who were killed during the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan. The conflict later became known as the \"Kargil War\". The memorial has a huge epitaph with names of all the officers and soldiers who died in war. Kargil Vijay Diwas is celebrated on 26 July every year at the memorial simultaneously the Prime Minister of India pays tribute to the soldiers at Amar Jawan Jyothi at the India Gate, New Delhi.The main attraction of the whole memorial is the Sandstone wall, in the open, which has the names of all the Indian army personnel, who laid their lives during the Kargil war besides there is also a souvenir shop. Visitors to the memorial can also see from there, some of the peaks that the Indian army captured back from Pakistan. A giant national flag, weighing 15\u00a0kg was hoisted at the Kargil war memorial to commemorate the 13th anniversary of India\u2019s victory in the warThe Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and situated on the cathedral green in Exeter, the county town of Devon, in the south west of England. It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city. The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds. After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead. The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations. A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials\u2014the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England. Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities\u2014the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922. The committee quickly raised \u00a310,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial. The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community. The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church. Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ.The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England. Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location. This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1884 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880. It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion.The Reading Post (until 2009, the Reading Evening Post), was an English local newspaper covering Reading, Berkshire and surrounding areas. The title page of the paper featured the Maiwand Lion, a famous local landmark at Forbury Gardens. The paper was most recently published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd., a division of Trinity Mirror plc.Spalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England. It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war. She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross. The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council. When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested. After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.The Forbury Hotel (formerly Shire Hall) is a grade II listed hotel in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.

A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials\u2014the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England. Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities\u2014the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922. The committee quickly raised \u00a310,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial. The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community. The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church. Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ.The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England. Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1884 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880. It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion.The Reading Post (until 2009, the Reading Evening Post), was an English local newspaper covering Reading, Berkshire and surrounding areas. The title page of the paper featured the Maiwand Lion, a famous local landmark at Forbury Gardens. The paper was most recently published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd.Spalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England. It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war. She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross. The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council. After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.The Forbury Hotel (formerly Shire Hall) is a grade II listed hotel in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire. It is situated on the southern side of Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town centre. It is located adjacent to the remaining ruins of Reading Abbey, between the Forbury Gardens and Reading Gaol.Forbury Gardens is a public park in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has taken a keen interest in the bid and has gone so far as ordering Vitaly Mutko, the Minister of Sports, to \"prepare a bid for Russia to hold the 2018 World Cup\". According to a report earlier submitted by Vitaly Mutko, who also served that time as President of the Russian Football Union (RFU), the country is ready to spend some $10 billion on the tournament. The bid committee also includes RFU CEO Alexey Sorokin and Alexander Djordjadze as the Director of Bid Planning and Operations. In October 2010, Russia formally pulled out of the race to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. On December 2, 2010 Russia was chosen as the host country for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.The Indonesia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the first official bid from the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) to host the FIFA World Cup. FIFA rejected the bid for lack of government support on 19 March 2010. Indonesia was one of four Asian countries bidding to bring the tournament to Asia for a second time, the 2002 tournament having been played in Japan and South Korea. Indonesia, under the name of the Dutch East Indies, had been the first Asian nation to compete in the World Cup, when they participated in the 1938 event, and they lost to Hungary in the first round.The Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid is the second official bid from the Japan Football Association or the JFA. Had this bid been successful, Japan would have been hosting their second World Cup Finals and it would have been their first solo hosting since they shared the 2002 FIFA World Cup with other co-host South Korea, becoming the sixth nation to host the tournament twice, after Italy, France, Mexico, Brazil and (West) Germany. On May 4, 2010, the Japanese Football Association Bid team decided to concentrate solely on winning the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups was the process by which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) selected locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups. The process began officially in March 2009; eleven bids from thirteen countries were received, including one which was withdrawn and one that was rejected before FIFA's executive committee voted in November 2010. Two of the remaining nine bids applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applications for both. Over the course of the bidding, all non-European bids for the 2018 event were withdrawn, resulting in the exclusion of all European bids from consideration for the 2022 edition. By the time of the decision, bids for the 2018 World Cup included England, Russia, a joint bid from Belgium and Netherlands, and a joint bid from Portugal and Spain. Indonesia's bid was disqualified due to lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid for financial reasons.The Korea 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the second official bid from the Korea Football Association or the KFA. Despite recent tensions, Han Sung-joo, chairman of the bid committee hoped to involve North Korea if South Korea received the bid.S.S.

Andrew Heckert, in his unpublished thesis, proposed the name \"Cinizasaurus hunti\" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007). In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauriformes.Sphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada. To date, three species have been described: the type species, \"S. goodwini\", from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; \"S. buchholtzae\", from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and \"S. edmontonense\", from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.

The name means \"Fruita tooth\", in reference to Fruita, Colorado (USA), where its fossils were first found. It is known from partial skulls and skeletons from at least four individuals of differing biological ages, found in Tithonian (Late Jurassic) rocks of the Morrison Formation in Colorado. \"Fruitadens\" is the smallest known ornithischian dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to in length and 0.5 to in weight. It is interpreted as an omnivore and represents one of the latest-surviving heterodontosaurids.Dakotadon is a genus of iguanodont dinosaur from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota, USA, known from a partial skull. It was first described in 1989 as \"Iguanodon lakotaensis\", by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork. Its assignment has been controversial. Some researchers suggest that \"\"I.\" lakotaensis\" was more basal than \"I. bernissartensis\", and related to \"Theiophytalia\", but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of \"I. bernissartensis\".

There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905. In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan. AT that time it was basically a gentlemen\'s club of members who were interested in all types of model building. In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City\'s Central Park for model motor boat races. It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \\" The Union Connecting\\". Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations. Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout. During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces. Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled. The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort. The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort. As members returned after the War a new location was searched for. This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ. They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time. The space? Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City. Here the layout was built. It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa. It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap. During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey.Clinton is a city in Big Stone County, Minnesota, United States.

Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier. There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier. It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier\'s ancestry. These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.The Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog of the smooth-haired terrier type.A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants. These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier. These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners. Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier.The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog. It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail. The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton.The Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: \\u0420\\u0443\\u0441\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0442\\u043e\\u0439, \\u0422\\u043e\\u0439\\u0447\\u0438\\u043a ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier. There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat. The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier. Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \\"Terrier\\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010.

Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument\'s neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly. Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings. Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods. Early ancestors include the Arabic \\"rebab\\" and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian \\"viole\\" and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish \\"vihuela\\", a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone).The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds. The type originated in Scotland and Northern England. The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout. Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types. Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the AKC has a breed they call \\"Collie\\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.

It provided for broad new disclosure requirements, and limited the amounts that candidates could spend on their campaigns, or that citizens could spend separate from candidate campaigns to promote their political views. Specifically, it attempted to restrict the influence of wealthy individuals by limiting individual donations to $1,000 and donations by political action committees (PACs) to $5,000.

It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city. The first proposal for the county\'s war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon\'s war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds. After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead. The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations. A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials\\u2014the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter\'s Square in Manchester, England.

The committee quickly raised \\u00a310,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial. The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city\'s artistic community. The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter\'s Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter\'s Church. Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ.The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England. Proposals for commemorating York\'s war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens\' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city\'s and the NER\'s memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York\'s existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER\'s memorial would overshadow the city\'s. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location. This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire.

It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. The proposal for a memorial to Spalding\'s war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town\'s Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war. She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross. The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council. When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested. After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren\'s proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town\'s corn exchange building.The Forbury Hotel (formerly Shire Hall) is a grade II listed hotel in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.

It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city. The first proposal for the county\'s war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon\'s war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds. After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead. The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations. A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials\\u2014the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens.Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter\'s Square in Manchester, England.

The committee quickly raised \\u00a310,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial. The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city\'s artistic community. The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter\'s Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter\'s Church. Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ.The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England. Proposals for commemorating York\'s war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York. Lutyens\' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city\'s and the NER\'s memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York\'s existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER\'s memorial would overshadow the city\'s. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1884 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880. It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion.The Reading Post (until 2009, the Reading Evening Post), was an English local newspaper covering Reading, Berkshire and surrounding areas. The title page of the paper featured the Maiwand Lion, a famous local landmark at Forbury Gardens. The paper was most recently published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd.Spalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England. It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. The proposal for a memorial to Spalding\'s war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town\'s Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war. She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross. The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council. After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren\'s proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town\'s corn exchange building.The Forbury Hotel (formerly Shire Hall) is a grade II listed hotel in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.

The remains, NMMNH P-18400, consist of a tibia, vertebrae, and fragments, and came from the ?late Carnian-age Upper Triassic Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation, near Fort Wingate. Andrew Heckert, in his unpublished thesis, proposed the name \\"Cinizasaurus hunti\\" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007). In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauriformes.Sphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada. To date, three species have been described: the type species, \\"S. goodwini\\", from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; \\"S. buchholtzae\\", from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and \\"S. edmontonense\\", from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada. The etymology of \\"Sphaerotholus\\" is a combination of the Greek \\"sphaira\\", meaning \\"ball\\", and \\"tholos\\", meaning \\"dome\\", and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull. The survival of \\"Sphaerotholus\\" from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8\\u00a0million years) and a widespread distribution. Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: \\"Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.\\" \\"Sphaerotholus\\" is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur.Oryctodromeus (meaning \\"digging runner\\") was a genus of small ornithopod dinosaur. Fossils are known from the middle Cretaceous Blackleaf Formation of southwestern Montana and the Wayan Formation of southeastern Idaho, USA, both of the Cenomanian stage, roughly 95 million years ago. A member of the small, presumably fast-running herbivorous family Thescelosauridae, \\"Oryctodromeus\\" is the first dinosaur published that shows evidence of burrowing behavior.\\"Cryptoraptor\\" (meaning \\"secret thief\\") is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a dinosaur.

To date, three species have been described: the type species, \\"S. goodwini\\", from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; \\"S. buchholtzae\\", from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and \\"S. edmontonense\\", from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada. The etymology of \\"Sphaerotholus\\" is a combination of the Greek \\"sphaira\\", meaning \\"ball\\", and \\"tholos\\", meaning \\"dome\\", and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull. The survival of \\"Sphaerotholus\\" from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8\\u00a0million years) and a widespread distribution. Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: \\"Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.\\" \\"Sphaerotholus\\" is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur.Oryctodromeus (meaning \\"digging runner\\") was a genus of small ornithopod dinosaur. Fossils are known from the middle Cretaceous Blackleaf Formation of southwestern Montana and the Wayan Formation of southeastern Idaho, USA, both of the Cenomanian stage, roughly 95 million years ago. A member of the small, presumably fast-running herbivorous family Thescelosauridae, \\"Oryctodromeus\\" is the first dinosaur published that shows evidence of burrowing behavior.\\"Cryptoraptor\\" (meaning \\"secret thief\\") is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a dinosaur.
