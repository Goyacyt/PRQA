The first category of acids is the proton donors or Br\u00f8nsted acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Br\u00f8nsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Br\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ .   Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/ac\u0113re meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in acid ' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic .   Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . As these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial sense ) can be solutions or pure substances , and can be derived from acids ( in the strict sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid .   The second category of acids are Lewis acids , which form a covalent bond with an electron pair . An example is boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( NH3 ) . Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Br\u00f8nsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( H+ ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs . However , hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids can not form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids . Conversely , many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids . In modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a Br\u00f8nsted acid and not a Lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid .   Definitions and concepts   Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids .   Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions , or can be dissolved in water , so the Arrhenius and Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant .   The Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton ( H+ ) from an acid to a base .   Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions . Interestingly , although alcohols and amines can be Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids , they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms .   Arrhenius acids   The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions ( H+ ) or protons in 1884 . An Arrhenius acid is a substance that , when added to water , increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water . Note that chemists often write H+ ( aq ) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus , a proton , does not exist alone in water , it exists as the hydronium ion , H3O+ .

{"test case number": 65, "context": "A cruise ship or cruise liner is a passenger ship used for pleasure voyages , where the voyage itself and the ship 's amenities are a part of the experience , as well as the different destinations , i.e. , ports of call , along the way .

Although often luxurious , ocean liners had characteristics that made them unsuitable for cruising , such as high fuel consumption , deep draught that prevented their entering shallow ports , enclosed weatherproof decks that were not appropriate for tropical weather , and cabins designed to maximize passenger numbers rather than comfort ( such as a high proportion of windowless suites ) . The gradual evolution of passenger ship design from ocean liners to cruise ships has seen passenger cabins shifted from inside the hull to the superstructure with private verandas .

In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England , Joseph Strutt , in 1611 , described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time : `` Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box [ wood ] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron , which he that can do at the fewest blows , or at the number agreed upon , wins .

They have long , slender bodies , which enable them to follow their prey into burrows . Their tails may be from 34 to long .   Weasels feed on small mammals , and have from time to time been considered vermin , since some species took poultry from farms , or rabbits from commercial warrens . They do on the other hand eat large numbers of rodents . They can be found all across the world except for Antarctica , Australia , and neighbouring islands .

In the Niigata Prefecture , the sound of a nate of weasels making a rustle resembled six people hulling rice , so was called the `` '' , and it was an omen for one 's home to decline or flourish .

He is also known for the Dickens adaptations of Great Expectations ( 1946 ) and Oliver Twist ( 1948 ) , as well as the romantic drama Brief Encounter ( 1945 ) .   Lauded by directors such as Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick , Lean was voted 9th greatest film director of all time in the British Film Institute Sight & Sound `` Directors ' Top Directors '' poll 2002 . Nominated seven times for the Academy Award for Best Director , which he won twice for The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia , he has three films in the top five of the British Film Institute 's Top 100 British Films . and was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1990 .   Early life and education   Lean was born in Croydon , Surrey ( now part of Greater London ) , to Francis William le Blount Lean and the former Helena Tangye ( niece of Sir Richard Trevithick Tangye ) . His parents were Quakers and he was a pupil at the Quaker-founded Leighton Park School in Reading . His younger brother , Edward Tangye Lean ( 1911\u20131974 ) , founded the original Inklings literary club when a student at Oxford University . Lean was a half-hearted schoolboy with a dreamy nature who was labeled a `` dud '' of a student ; he left in his mid-teens and entered his father 's chartered accountancy firm as an apprentice . A more formative event for his career than his formal education was an uncle 's gift , when Lean was aged ten , of a Brownie box camera . `` You usually did n't give a boy a camera until he was 16 or 17 in those days . It was a huge compliment and I succeeded at it . ' Lean printed and developed his films , and it was his 'great hobby ' . At age 16 , his father deserted the family when he ran off with another woman , and Lean would later follow a similar path after his own first marriage and child .   Period as film editor   Bored by his work , Lean spent every evening in the cinema , and in 1927 , after an aunt had advised him to find a job he enjoyed doing , he went to Gaumont Studios where his obvious enthusiasm earned him a month 's trial without pay . He was taken on as a teaboy , promoted to clapperboy , and soon rose to the position of third assistant director . By 1930 he was working as an editor on newsreels , including those of Gaumont Pictures and Movietone , while his move to feature films began with Freedom of the Seas ( 1934 ) and Escape Me Never ( 1935 ) .   He edited Gabriel Pascal 's film productions of two George Bernard Shaw plays , Pygmalion ( 1938 ) and Major Barbara ( 1941 ) . He edited Powell & Pressburger 's 49th Parallel ( 1941 ) and One of Our Aircraft Is Missing ( 1942 ) . After this last film , Lean began his directing career , after editing more than two dozen features by 1942 .

Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones . With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed . The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced .   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments . The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe . During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings . By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key .

Cameras evolved from the camera obscura , and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology , including daguerreotypes , calotypes , dry plates , film , and digital cameras .   Camera obscura   Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura , a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese and ancient Greeks , which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface .   An Arab physicist , Ibn al-Haytham , published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD . He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter . Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images . Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura .

The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685 , though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible .   Early fixed images   The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce ,   using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride , which darkened where it was exposed to light . No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Ni\u00e9pce , so the photograph was not permanent , eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it . In the mid-1820s , Ni\u00e9pce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea . The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image . The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away . One of those photographs has survived .   Daguerreotypes and calotypes   After Ni\u00e9pce 's death in 1833 , his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process , which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839 . Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide . After exposure in the camera , the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt ( sodium chloride ) . Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process , the calotype , in 1840 . As commercialized , both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes . The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus . After focusing , the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped . Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder , uncapped the lens , and counted off as many seconds\u2014or minutes\u2014as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder .

Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants .   The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870 , when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport ( steam-powered railways , boats and ships ) , the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories .   Etymology   The earliest recorded use of the term `` Industrial Revolution '' seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto , announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise . In his 1976 book Keywords : A Vocabulary of Culture and Society , Raymond Williams states in the entry for `` Industry '' : `` The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen , between 1811 and 1818 , and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the [ 19th ] century . '' The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s , as in J\u00e9r\u00f4me-Adolphe Blanqui 's description in 1837 of la r\u00e9volution industrielle . Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of `` an industrial revolution , a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society '' . However , although Engels wrote in the 1840s , his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s , and his expression did not enter everyday language until then . Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee , whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term .   Some historians , such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts , have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer . This is still a subject of debate among historians .   Important technological developments   The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations , beginning in the second half of the 18th century . By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies :  * Textiles \u2013 Mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water greatly increased the output of a worker . The power loom increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40 .

Etymology   The earliest recorded use of the term `` Industrial Revolution '' seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto , announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise . In his 1976 book Keywords : A Vocabulary of Culture and Society , Raymond Williams states in the entry for `` Industry '' : `` The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen , between 1811 and 1818 , and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the [ 19th ] century . Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of `` an industrial revolution , a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society '' . However , although Engels wrote in the 1840s , his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s , and his expression did not enter everyday language until then .   Some historians , such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts , have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer . This is still a subject of debate among historians .   Important technological developments   The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations , beginning in the second half of the 18th century . By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies :  * Textiles \u2013 Mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water greatly increased the output of a worker . The power loom increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40 .", "question": "name the leicester-born eponymous inspiration of the early 19th textile machinery smashers of the english industrial revolution, whose collective name is now a term for someone resisting new technology?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "a textile machinery smasher", "modAnswer": "edmund tilney", "delete sentence number": ["   The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history ;", " almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way .", " Since then industrialisation has spread throughout the world .", " The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians , as is the pace of economic and social changes .", " '' The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s , as in J\u00e9r\u00f4me-Adolphe Blanqui 's description in 1837 of la r\u00e9volution industrielle .", " Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee , whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term ."], "distance value": [[24, 0.5367915630340576], [2, 0.5262174010276794], [17, 0.5171935558319092], [3, 0.4982583820819855], [1, 0.49163326621055603], [14, 0.4769943356513977], [23, 0.4764779210090637], [8, 0.4742218852043152], [0, 0.4482230246067047], [15, 0.42291632294654846], [4, 0.41826772689819336], [18, 0.4078238904476166], [16, 0.3998556137084961], [21, 0.3849547505378723], [10, 0.3822552561759949], [9, 0.3703952431678772], [7, 0.3622075021266937], [20, 0.3503498435020447], [11, 0.33013916015625], [25, 0.3122046887874603], [13, 0.28812021017074585], [6, 0.26347482204437256], [22, 0.16867414116859436], [19, 0.16574300825595856], [12, 0.1590253859758377], [5, 0.1005512923002243]]}

Richard has sold more than 250 million records worldwide . He has total sales of over 21 million singles in the UK and is the third-top-selling artist in UK Singles Chart history , behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley .   With his backing group , the Shadows , Richard , originally positioned as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard and Elvis Presley , dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s and early 1960s . His 1958 hit single , `` Move It '' , is often described as Britain 's first authentic rock and roll song , and John Lennon once claimed that `` before Cliff and the Shadows , there had been nothing worth listening to in British music . '' Increased focus on his Christian faith and subsequent softening of his music later led to a more middle of the road pop image , and he sometimes ventured into contemporary Christian music .   Over a career spanning more than 50 years Richard has amassed many gold and platinum discs and awards , including three Brit Awards\u2014winning Best British Male twice and the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music , and two Ivor Novello Awards . He has had more than 130 singles , albums and EPs make the UK Top 20 , more than any other artist and holds the record ( with Elvis Presley ) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades ( 1950s\u20132000s ) . He has achieved 14 UK No . 1 singles , and is the only singer to have had a No . 1 single in the UK in five consecutive decades : the 1950s through to the 1990s .   In 2008 , he celebrated his 50th anniversary in music by releasing a greatest hits album , featuring the new track `` Thank You for a Lifetime '' , which reached No . 3 in the UK singles chart . In November 2013 , Richard released The Fabulous Rock 'n ' Roll Songbook , which became the 100th album of his career .   Richard has never achieved the same impact in the United States despite eight US Top 40 singles , including the million-selling `` Devil Woman '' and `` We Do n't Talk Anymore , '' the latter becoming the first to reach the Billboard Hot 100 's top 40 in the 1980s by a singer who had been in the Billboard top 40 in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s . In Canada , Richard achieved comparatively more success , with a successful period in the early 1960s , and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s with some singles and albums reaching gold and platinum status . He has remained a popular music , film , and television personality in Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Northern Europe and Asia , and he retains a following in other countries .

With his backing group , the Shadows , Richard , originally positioned as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard and Elvis Presley , dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s and early 1960s . His 1958 hit single , `` Move It '' , is often described as Britain 's first authentic rock and roll song , and John Lennon once claimed that `` before Cliff and the Shadows , there had been nothing worth listening to in British music .   Over a career spanning more than 50 years Richard has amassed many gold and platinum discs and awards , including three Brit Awards\u2014winning Best British Male twice and the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music , and two Ivor Novello Awards .

In Canada , Richard achieved comparatively more success , with a successful period in the early 1960s , and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s with some singles and albums reaching gold and platinum status .

The winning team is the one that scores the most runs , including any extras gained , during their period batting .   At the start of each game , two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play . The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team , known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , towards a set of wooden stumps , in front of which stands one of the batsmen , known as the striker . The striker 's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat , and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs . The other batsman , known as the non-striker , waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler . The bowler 's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman , at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease .   The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball , leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat , and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground . Runs are scored through two main methods : either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary , or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball . If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground , a run-out occurs . Adjudication is performed on-field by two umpires .

{"test case number": 264, "context": "Wales ( ; ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain . It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . Wales has over 1680 mi of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff ( the capital ) , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added ( GVA ) was \u00a345.5 billion ( \u00a315,145 per head , 74.0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain ) .   Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560,000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the `` land of song '' , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness .   Etymology   The English words `` Wales '' and `` Welsh '' derive from the same Germanic root ( singular Walh , plural Walha ) , which was itself derived from the name of the Celtic tribe known to the Romans as Volcae and which came to refer indiscriminately to all Celts and , later , to all inhabitants of the Roman Empire . The Old English-speaking Anglo-Saxons came to use the term W\u00e6lisc when referring to the Celtic Britons in particular , and W\u0113alas when referring to their lands . The modern names for some Continental European lands ( e.g . Wallonia and Wallachia ) and peoples ( e.g . the Vlachs via a borrowing into Old Church Slavonic ) have a similar etymology .   Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that the Anglo-Saxons associated with the Britons , including other non-Germanic territories in Britain ( e.g . Cornwall ) and Germanic territories particularly associated with Celtic Britons ( e.g . Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ) , as well as items associated with non-Germanic Europeans , such as the walnut .   The modern Welsh name for themselves", "modContext": "Wales ( ; ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism .

The war is also known under other names , such as the Persian Gulf War , First Gulf War , Gulf War I , Kuwait War , First Iraq War , or Iraq War before the term `` Iraq War '' became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War ( also referred to in the U.S. as `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' ) .  The Iraqi Army 's occupation of Kuwait that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation , and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N.

{"test case number": 292, "context": "Saturday Night Live ( abbreviated as SNL ) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol . The show premiered on NBC on October 11 , 1975 , under the original title NBC 's Saturday Night . The show 's comedy sketches , which parody contemporary culture and politics , are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members . Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest ( who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast ) and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it 's Saturday Night ! `` , properly beginning the show .   In 1980 Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities . He was replaced by Jean Doumanian , who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews . Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera . Others associated with the show , such as writers , have gone on to successful careers creating , writing , or starring in TV and film .   Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC 's headquarters in the Comcast Building , SNL has aired 808 episodes since its debut , and concluded its forty-first season on May 21 , 2016 , making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States . The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries , including Canada , Spain , Italy , South Korea , Japan , Brazil , and Finland , each meeting with different levels of success . Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers ( 1980 ) and Wayne 's World ( 1992 ) . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of '' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show .   Throughout four decades on air , Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards , including 42 Primetime Emmy Awards , two Peabody Awards , and three Writers Guild of America Awards . In 2000 , it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame . It was ranked tenth in TV Guide `` 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time '' list , and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine 's `` 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME '' . As of 2012 , it has received 156 Emmy nominations , the most received by any TV show . The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship , with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests .   Development    From 1965 until September 1975 , NBC ran The Best of Carson reruns of The Tonight Show , airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates ' discretion ( originally known as The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson ) . In 1974 Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weeknights , allowing him to take time off .   In 1974 NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming , Dick Ebersol , and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot . At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller , Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels . Over the next three weeks , Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter 's idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches , political satire , and music performances . By 1975 Michaels had assembled a talented cast , including Dan Aykroyd , John Belushi , Chevy Chase , Jane Curtin , Garrett Morris , Laraine Newman , Michael O'Donoghue , Gilda Radner , and George Coe . The show was originally called NBC 's Saturday Night , because Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC . NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26 , 1977", "modContext": "Saturday Night Live ( abbreviated as SNL ) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol . The show premiered on NBC on October 11 , 1975 , under the original title NBC 's Saturday Night . The show 's comedy sketches , which parody contemporary culture and politics , are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members . Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest ( who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast ) and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it 's Saturday Night ! Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera .   Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC 's headquarters in the Comcast Building , SNL has aired 808 episodes since its debut , and concluded its forty-first season on May 21 , 2016 , making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States . The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries , including Canada , Spain , Italy , South Korea , Japan , Brazil , and Finland , each meeting with different levels of success . Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers ( 1980 ) and Wayne 's World ( 1992 ) . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of '' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show . In 2000 , it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame . It was ranked tenth in TV Guide `` 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time '' list , and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine 's `` 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME '' . As of 2012 , it has received 156 Emmy nominations , the most received by any TV show . The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship , with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests .   Development    From 1965 until September 1975 , NBC ran The Best of Carson reruns of The Tonight Show , airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates ' discretion ( originally known as The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson ) . In 1974 Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weeknights , allowing him to take time off .

A member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg , Philip was born into the Greek and Danish royal families . He was born in Greece but his family was exiled from the country when he was still an infant .

From July 1939 , he began corresponding with the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth ( his third cousin through Queen Victoria and second cousin once removed through Christian IX of Denmark ) , whom he had first met in 1934 . During World War II he served with the Mediterranean and Pacific fleets .   After the war , Philip was granted permission by George VI to marry Elizabeth . Before the official announcement of their engagement , he abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles and became a naturalised British subject , adopting the surname Mountbatten from his maternal grandparents . After an engagement of five months , he married Elizabeth on 20 November 1947 . Just before the wedding , the King granted him the style of His Royal Highness and the title Duke of Edinburgh . Philip left active military service when Elizabeth became Queen in 1952 , having reached the rank of commander . His wife made him a prince of the United Kingdom in 1957 .

Through a British Order in Council issued in 1960 , descendants of Philip and Elizabeth not bearing royal styles and titles can use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor , which has also been used by some members of the royal family who do hold titles , such as Charles and Anne .

Louis was a naturalised British citizen , who , after a career in the Royal Navy , had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War . After visiting London for the memorial , Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the Greco-Turkish War ( 1919\u20131922 ) .

{"test case number": 331, "context": "The Big Breakfast was a British light entertainment television show shown on Channel 4 and S4C each weekday morning from 28 September 1992 until 29 March 2002 during which period 2,482 shows were produced . The Big Breakfast was produced by Planet 24 , the production company co-owned by former Boomtown Rats singer and Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof .   The programme was distinctive for broadcasting live from a former lockkeepers ' cottages commonly referred to as `` The Big Breakfast House '' , or more simply , `` The House '' , located on Fish Island , in Bow in east London .   The show was a mix of news , weather , interviews , audience phone-ins and general features , with a light tone which was in competition with the more serious GMTV and even more serious BBC Breakfast programmes .   History   The Big Breakfast was launched at the end of September 1992 to replace The Channel Four Daily , which was Channel 4 's unsuccessful first dip into the breakfast television market between 1989 and 1992 . The Daily , launched at huge expense , had possessed an analytical style , focusing largely on current affairs , news bulletins and cerebral quiz shows ; however , this format had failed to earn enough viewing figures , and consequently Channel 4 opted to change direction and work towards a lighter style concentrating mainly on entertainment and humour .   The first two presenters were Chris Evans ( from 1992 to 1994 ) and Gaby Roslin ( 1992 to 1996 ) . At its height in 1993 , viewing figures reached around two million per edition , and it was the highest rated UK breakfast television programme . Along with Evans and Roslin , Bob Geldof presented a short-lived political interview slot . His wife Paula Yates became notorious with her interviews conducted lying on a bed , and the puppet characters Zig and Zag created morning mayhem in the bathroom with Evans in a slot called 'The Crunch ' .   As part of his contract with The Big Breakfast , Evans was committed to developing a new show for Channel 4 .

Former Neighbours star Mark Little replaced Evans on Mondays and Fridays . When Evans left the show later that year , Little continued on Thursdays and Fridays while Paul Ross took over Mondays to Wednesdays . Richard Orford replaced Ross around Easter 1995 but was quickly dropped and exchanged with Down Your Doorstep presenter Keith Chegwin . In July 1995 , the show reverted to using just one male presenter throughout the week , Mark Little . Chegwin would cover for Little when he was on tour as a comedian or on holiday .   Relaunch   Roslin continued full-time until she made way for Zo\u00eb Ball in 1996 . Audience figures slipped a little after Evans left , and a little more after Roslin stopped appearing . Mark Little left the programme in July 1996 , following press reports that he and Zo\u00eb Ball had fallen out . Little was replaced by Keith Chegwin , who himself exited the programme in August 1996 , just ahead of a massive relaunch . In an attempt to stem the sliding viewing figures , the Big Breakfast house was refurbished at a cost of \u00a32 million . New presenters Rick Adams and Sharron Davies were brought in but viewing figures fell dramatically . Davies left the programme in early 1997 , to be replaced by Denise van Outen . Van Outen had initially been brought in as part of the September 1996 relaunch as a traffic and travel presenter , before being given a role based at the house as the phone room presenter and holiday relief for Davies . In June 1997 , Johnny Vaughan covered for Adams for a fortnight alongside Van Outen , the pair forging a successful on screen partnership . Adams left the programme shortly afterwards and , in September 1997 , the Vaughan and Van Outen partnership was made permanent . Audience figures stabilised and the duo fronted the programme together until Van Outen 's departure on January 1 , 1999 . ( A New Year 's Day pre-record ) .

The Big Breakfast was produced by Planet 24 , the production company co-owned by former Boomtown Rats singer and Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof .   The programme was distinctive for broadcasting live from a former lockkeepers ' cottages commonly referred to as `` The Big Breakfast House '' , or more simply , `` The House '' , located on Fish Island , in Bow in east London .   The show was a mix of news , weather , interviews , audience phone-ins and general features , with a light tone which was in competition with the more serious GMTV and even more serious BBC Breakfast programmes .   History   The Big Breakfast was launched at the end of September 1992 to replace The Channel Four Daily , which was Channel 4 's unsuccessful first dip into the breakfast television market between 1989 and 1992 . The Daily , launched at huge expense , had possessed an analytical style , focusing largely on current affairs , news bulletins and cerebral quiz shows ; however , this format had failed to earn enough viewing figures , and consequently Channel 4 opted to change direction and work towards a lighter style concentrating mainly on entertainment and humour .   The first two presenters were Chris Evans ( from 1992 to 1994 ) and Gaby Roslin ( 1992 to 1996 ) . At its height in 1993 , viewing figures reached around two million per edition , and it was the highest rated UK breakfast television programme . Along with Evans and Roslin , Bob Geldof presented a short-lived political interview slot . His wife Paula Yates became notorious with her interviews conducted lying on a bed , and the puppet characters Zig and Zag created morning mayhem in the bathroom with Evans in a slot called 'The Crunch ' .

{"test case number": 344, "context": "The Byzantine Empire , sometimes referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire , was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages , when its capital city was Constantinople ( modern-day Istanbul , originally founded as Byzantium ) . It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural , and military force in Europe . Both `` Byzantine Empire '' and `` Eastern Roman Empire '' are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire ( , tr . ; ) , or Romania ( ) , and to themselves as `` Romans '' .   Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West divided . Constantine I ( r. 324\u2013337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital , and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379\u2013395 ) , Christianity became the Empire 's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . Finally , under the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610\u2013641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin . Thus , although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture , and characterised by Orthodox Christianity .   The borders of the Empire evolved significantly over its existence , as it went through several cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527\u2013565 ) , the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy , and Rome itself , which it held for two more centuries . During the reign of Maurice ( r. 582\u2013602 ) , the Empire 's eastern frontier was expanded and the north stabilised . However , his assassination caused the Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628 , which exhausted the Empire 's resources and contributed to major territorial losses during the Muslim conquests of the seventh century . In a matter of years the Empire lost its richest provinces , Egypt and Syria , to the Arabs .   During the Macedonian dynasty ( 10th\u201311th centuries ) , the Empire again expanded and experienced the two-century long Macedonian Renaissance , which came to an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . This battle opened the way for the Turks to settle in Anatolia as a homeland .   The Empire recovered again during the Komnenian restoration , such that by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city . However , it was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade , when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 and the territories that the Empire formerly governed were divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms . Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261 , the Byzantine Empire remained only one of several small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence . Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century . The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 finally ended the Byzantine Empire .   Nomenclature   The first use of the term `` Byzantine '' to label the later years of the Roman Empire was in 1557 , when the German historian Hieronymus Wolf published his work Corpus Histori\u00e6 Byzantin\u00e6 , a collection of historical sources . The term comes from `` Byzantium '' , the name of the city of Constantinople before it became Constantine 's capital . This older name of the city would rarely be used from this point onward except in historical or poetic contexts .

{"test case number": 359, "context": "The four cardinal directions or cardinal points are the directions of north , east , south , and west , commonly denoted by their initials : N , E , S , W. East and west are at right angles to north and south , with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east . Intermediate points between the four cardinal directions form the points of the compass . The intermediate ( intercardinal , or ordinal ) directions are northeast ( NE ) , southeast ( SE ) , southwest ( SW ) , and northwest ( NW ) . Further , the intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction , the eight shortest points in the compass rose to the right , i.e . NNE , ENE , ESE , and so on .   Locating the directions   Direction versus bearing   To keep to a bearing is not , in general , the same as going in a straight direction along a great circle . Conversely , one can keep to a great circle and the bearing may change . Thus the bearing of a straight path crossing the North Pole changes abruptly at the Pole from North to South . When travelling East or West , it is only on the Equator that one can keep East or West and be going straight ( without need to steer ) . Anywhere else , maintaining latitude requires a change in direction , requires steering . However , this change in direction becomes increasingly negligible as one moves to lower latitudes .   Magnetic compass   The Earth has a magnetic field which is approximately aligned with its axis of rotation . A magnetic compass is a device that uses this field to determine the cardinal directions . Magnetic compasses are extremely widely used , but only moderately accurate .   The Sun   The position of the Sun in the sky can be used for orientation if the general time of day is known . In the morning , the Sun rises roughly in the east ( due east only on the equinoxes ) and tracks upwards . In the evening it sets in the west , again roughly and only due west exactly on the equinoxes . In the middle of the day it is to the south for viewers in the Northern Hemisphere , who live north of the Tropic of Cancer , and the north for those in the Southern Hemisphere , who live south of the Tropic of Capricorn . This method works less well closer to the equator ( i.e . between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn ) since , in the northern hemisphere , the sun may be directly overhead or even to the north in summer . Conversely , at low latitudes in the southern hemisphere the sun may be to the south of the observer in summer . In these locations , one needs first to determine whether the sun is moving from east to west through north or south by watching its movements\u2014left to right means it is going through south while right to left means it is going through north ; or one can watch the sun 's shadows . If they move clockwise , the sun will be in the south at midday , and if they move anticlockwise , then the sun will be in the north at midday .   Due to the Earth 's axial tilt , no matter what the location of the viewer , there are only two days each year when the sun rises precisely due east . These days are the equinoxes . On all other days , depending on the time of year , the sun rises either north or south of true east ( and sets north or south of true west ) . For all locations the sun is seen to rise north of east ( and set north of west ) from the Northward equinox to the Southward equinox , and rise south of east ( and set south of west ) from the Southward equinox to the Northward equinox .   A more accurate fix can be made if the time of year and approximate latitude are factored in . The amount that the sun appears to be either north or south depends on both the time of year and latitude of the observer . Knowing these will enable the observer to be more precise when determining the cardinal directions from the sun 's position , particularly in the early morning or late afternoon .", "modContext": "The four cardinal directions or cardinal points are the directions of north , east , south , and west , commonly denoted by their initials : N , E , S , W. East and west are at right angles to north and south , with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east . Intermediate points between the four cardinal directions form the points of the compass . The intermediate ( intercardinal , or ordinal ) directions are northeast ( NE ) , southeast ( SE ) , southwest ( SW ) , and northwest ( NW ) . Further , the intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction , the eight shortest points in the compass rose to the right , i.   Locating the directions   Direction versus bearing   To keep to a bearing is not , in general , the same as going in a straight direction along a great circle . Conversely , one can keep to a great circle and the bearing may change . Thus the bearing of a straight path crossing the North Pole changes abruptly at the Pole from North to South . Anywhere else , maintaining latitude requires a change in direction , requires steering . However , this change in direction becomes increasingly negligible as one moves to lower latitudes .   Magnetic compass   The Earth has a magnetic field which is approximately aligned with its axis of rotation . A magnetic compass is a device that uses this field to determine the cardinal directions .   The Sun   The position of the Sun in the sky can be used for orientation if the general time of day is known . In the evening it sets in the west , again roughly and only due west exactly on the equinoxes . In the middle of the day it is to the south for viewers in the Northern Hemisphere , who live north of the Tropic of Cancer , and the north for those in the Southern Hemisphere , who live south of the Tropic of Capricorn . This method works less well closer to the equator ( i. between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn ) since , in the northern hemisphere , the sun may be directly overhead or even to the north in summer . Conversely , at low latitudes in the southern hemisphere the sun may be to the south of the observer in summer . In these locations , one needs first to determine whether the sun is moving from east to west through north or south by watching its movements\u2014left to right means it is going through south while right to left means it is going through north ; or one can watch the sun 's shadows . If they move clockwise , the sun will be in the south at midday , and if they move anticlockwise , then the sun will be in the north at midday . These days are the equinoxes . For all locations the sun is seen to rise north of east ( and set north of west ) from the Northward equinox to the Southward equinox , and rise south of east ( and set south of west ) from the Southward equinox to the Northward equinox .   A more accurate fix can be made if the time of year and approximate latitude are factored in .

He was also a geologist and palaeontologist , writing the first full account of a fossil dinosaur , which he named Megalosaurus . His work proving that Kirkdale Cave had been a prehistoric hyena den , for which he was awarded the Copley Medal , was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct events from the distant past . He was a pioneer in the use of fossilised faeces , for which he coined the term coprolites , to reconstruct ancient ecosystems .   Buckland was a proponent of the Gap Theory that interpreted the biblical account of Genesis as referring to two separate episodes of creation separated by a lengthy period ; it emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a way to reconcile the scriptural account with discoveries in geology that suggested the earth was very old . Early in his career he believed that he had found geological evidence of the biblical flood , but later became convinced that the glaciation theory of Louis Agassiz provided a better explanation , and he played an important role in promoting that theory in Great Britain .   Early life and university   Buckland was born at Axminster in DevonChisholm , 1911 and , as a child , would accompany his father , the Rector of Templeton and Trusham , on his walks where interest in road improvements led to collecting fossil shells , including ammonites , from the Jurassic lias rocks exposed in local quarries .   He was educated first at Blundell 's School , Tiverton , Devon , and then at Winchester College , from where in 1801 he won a scholarship to study for the ministry at Corpus Christi College , Oxford , also attending the lectures of John Kidd on mineralogy and chemistry , as well as developing an interest in geology and carrying out field research on strata , during vacations . Having taken his BA in 1804 , he went on to obtain his MA degree in 1808 . He then became a Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1809 , was ordained as a priest and continued to make frequent geological excursions , on horseback , to various parts of England , Scotland , Ireland and Wales . In 1813 , he was appointed reader in mineralogy , in succession to John Kidd , giving lively and popular lectures with increasing emphasis on geology and palaeontology . As ( unofficial ) curator of the Ashmolean Museum , he built up collections , touring Europe and coming into contact with scientists including Georges Cuvier .   Rejection of flood geology and Kirkdale Cave   In 1818 , Buckland was elected a fellow of the Royal Society . That year he persuaded the Prince Regent to endow an additional Readership , this time in Geology and he became the first holder of the new appointment , delivering his inaugural address on 15 May 1819 . This was published in 1820 as Vindici\u00e6 Geologi\u00e6 ; or the Connexion of Geology with Religion explained , both justifying the new science of geology and reconciling geological evidence with the biblical accounts of creation and Noah 's Flood . At a time when others were coming under the opposing influence of James Hutton 's theory of uniformitarianism , Buckland developed a new hypothesis that the word `` beginning '' in Genesis meant an undefined period between the origin of the earth and the creation of its current inhabitants , during which a long series of extinctions and successive creations of new kinds of plants and animals had occurred . Thus , his catastrophism theory incorporated a version of Old Earth creationism or Gap creationism . Buckland believed in a global deluge during the time of Noah but was not a supporter of flood geology as he believed that only a small amount of the strata could have been formed in the single year occupied by the deluge .   From his investigations of fossil bones at Kirkdale Cave , in Yorkshire , he concluded that the cave had actually been inhabited by hyaenas in antediluvian times , and that the fossils were the remains of these hyaenas and the animals they had eaten , rather than being remains of animals that had perished in the Flood and then carried from the tropics by the surging waters , as he and others had at first thought .

Literary prose   While prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel , the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the Romance language of southern France , especially those by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes ( late 12th century ) , and in Middle English ( Geoffrey Chaucer 's ( c. 1343 \u2013 1400 ) The Canterbury Tales ) . Even in the 19th century , fictional narratives in verse , such as Lord Byron 's Don Juan ( 1824 ) , Alexander Pushkin 's Yevgeniy Onegin ( 1833 ) , and Elizabeth Barrett Browning 's Aurora Leigh ( 1856 ) , competed with prose novels . Vikram Seth 's The Golden Gate ( 1986 ) , composed of 590 Onegin stanzas , is a more recent example of the verse novel .   Content : intimate experience   Both in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe , prose fiction created intimate reading situations .

Ilium is a more poetic term : Hittite : Wilusa or Truwisa ; ) was a city situated in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor , now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey , near ( just south of ) the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles straits and northwest of Mount Ida . The present-day location is known as Hisarl\u0131k . It was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle , in particular in the Iliad , one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer . Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey suggests that the name ( Ilion ) formerly began with a digamma : ( Wilion ) ; this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city , Wilusa .   A new capital called Ilium was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus . It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople and declined gradually in the Byzantine era .   In 1865 , English archaeologist Frank Calvert excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarl\u0131k , and in 1868 , Heinrich Schliemann , a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist , also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in \u00c7anakkale . These excavations revealed several cities built in succession . Schliemann was at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy , but was persuaded by Calvert and took over Calvert 's excavations on the eastern half of the Hisarlik site , which was on Calvert 's property . Troy VII has been identified with the Hittite city Wilusa , the probable origin of the Greek \u1f3c\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd , and is generally ( but not conclusively ) identified with Homeric Troy .   Today , the hill at Hisarl\u0131k has given its name to a small village near the ruins , which supports the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site . It lies within the province of \u00c7anakkale , some 30 km south-west of the provincial capital , also called \u00c7anakkale . The nearest village is Tevfikiye .

Modern archaeologists associate Homeric Troy with archaeological Troy VII .   In the Iliad , the Achaeans set up their camp near the mouth of the River Scamander ( presumably modern Karamenderes ) , where they had beached their ships . The city of Troy itself stood on a hill , across the plain of Scamander , where the battles of the Trojan War took place . The site of the ancient city is some 5 km from the coast today , but 3,000 years ago the mouths of Scamander were much closer to the city , discharging into a large bay that formed a natural harbour and which has since been filled with alluvial material .

Indigenous cookery   In the precolonial period , indigenous cuisine was characterised by the use of a very wide range of foods including fruits , nuts , bulbs , leaves and other products gathered from wild plants and by the hunting of wild game . The introduction of domestic cattle and grain crops by Bantu speakers who arrived in the southern regions from central Africa since 10,000 BC and the spread of cattle keeping to Khoisan groups enabled products and the availability of fresh meat on demand . The pre-colonial diet consisted primarily of cooked grains , especially sorghum , fermented milk ( somewhat like yogurt ) and roasted or stewed meat . At some point , maize replaced sorghum as the primary grain , and there is some dispute as to whether maize , a Central American crop , arrived with European settlers ( notably the Portuguese ) or spread through Africa before white settlement via Africans returning from the Americas during the era of the slave trade . People also kept sheep and goats , and communities often organised vast hunts for the abundant game ; but beef was considered the absolutely most important and high status meat . The ribs of any cattle that were slaughtered in many communities were so prized that they were offered to the chief of the village .   In many ways , the daily food of South African families can be traced to the indigenous foods that their ancestors ate . A typical meal in a South African family household that is Bantu-speaking is a stiff , fluffy porridge of maize meal ( called `` pap , '' and very similar to American grits ) with a flavourful stewed meat gravy . Traditional rural families ( and many urban ones ) often ferment their pap for a few days \u2013 especially if it is sorghum instead of maize \u2013 which gives it a tangy flavor . The Sotho-Tswana call this fermented pap , `` ting .

Rice and beans are also very popular even though they are not indigenous . Another common vegetable dish , which arrived in South Africa with its many Irish immigrants , but which has been adopted by South Africans , is shredded cabbage and white potatoes cooked with butter .   For many South Africans meat is the centre of any meal . The Khoisan ate roasted meat , and they also dried meat for later use . The influence of their diet is reflected in the common Southern African love of barbecue ( generally called in South Africa by its Afrikaans name , a `` braai '' ) and biltong ( dried preserved meat ) . As in the past , when men kept cattle as their prized possession in the rural areas , South Africans have a preference for beef . Today , South Africans enjoy not only beef , but mutton , goat , chicken and other meats as a centrepiece of a meal . On weekends , many South African families have a `` braai , '' and the meal usually consists of `` pap and vleis '' , which is maize meal and grilled meat . Eating meat even has a ritual significance in both traditional and modern South African culture . In Bantu culture , for weddings , initiations , the arrival of family members after a long trip and other special occasions , families will buy a live animal and slaughter it at home , and then prepare a large meal for the community or neighbourhood . Participants often say that spilling the blood of the animal on the ground pleases the ancestors who invisibly gather around the carcass .

The navy was first created to support Manuel Belgrano in the Paraguay campaign , but it was sunk by ships from Montevideo , and did not take part in that conflict . Renewed conflicts with Montevideo led to the creation of a second fleet , which participated in the capture of the city . As Buenos Aires had little maritime history , most men in the navy were from other nations , such as the Irish-born admiral William Brown , who directed the operation . As the cost of maintaining a navy was too high , most of the Argentine naval forces were composed of privateers .   Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata .   In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself . At the close of the century , the force included :   * 5 armoured cruisers  * 4 coastal defence ironclads  * 3 second-class , high-speed , British-built cruisers  * 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats  * 4 destroyers and  * 22 torpedo boats .   The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships : , , and , each at over 6,000 tons . Three older ironclads , , , and dated from the 1880s and early 1890s .   The navy 's ships were built primarily in Italy , Britain , France , and Spain and were operated by over 600 officers and 7760 seamen . These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery .   20th century   Argentina remained neutral in both world wars . In 1940 , Argentina 's navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world ( after the European powers , Japan , and the United States ) and the largest in Latin America . A ten-year building programme costing $ 60 million had produced a force of 14,500 sailors and over a thousand officers . The fleet included two First World War-era ( but modernized ) American-built s , three modern cruisers , a dozen British-built destroyers , and three submarines in addition to minelayers , minesweepers , coastal defence ships , and gunboats . A naval air force was also in operation .   In the postwar period , Naval Aviation and Marine Corps units were put under direct Navy command .

The Navy also took part in all military coups through the 20th century . During the last dictatorship , Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War of the late 1970s in which thousands of people were kidnapped , tortured and killed by the forces of the Military Junta .

Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata .   In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself . At the close of the century , the force included :   * 5 armoured cruisers  * 4 coastal defence ironclads  * 3 second-class , high-speed , British-built cruisers  * 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats  * 4 destroyers and  * 22 torpedo boats .   The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships : , , and , each at over 6,000 tons .   The navy 's ships were built primarily in Italy , Britain , France , and Spain and were operated by over 600 officers and 7760 seamen . These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery . In 1940 , Argentina 's navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world ( after the European powers , Japan , and the United States ) and the largest in Latin America . The fleet included two First World War-era ( but modernized ) American-built s , three modern cruisers , a dozen British-built destroyers , and three submarines in addition to minelayers , minesweepers , coastal defence ships , and gunboats . A naval air force was also in operation .   In the postwar period , Naval Aviation and Marine Corps units were put under direct Navy command .   The Argentine Navy has been traditionally heavily involved in fishery inspection helping the Coast Guard : most notably in 1966 a destroyer fired on and holed a Soviet trawler that had refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata , in the 1970s there were four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships and continued in recent years . During the last dictatorship , Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War of the late 1970s in which thousands of people were kidnapped , tortured and killed by the forces of the Military Junta . Among their more well-known victims were the Swedish teenager Dagmar Hagelin and French nuns , Alice Domon and L\u00e9onie Duquet ( In October 2007 the Argentine Navy formally handed possession of the school to human rights groups to turn into a memorial museum ) . During this regime , the Navy was also the main supporter of a military solution for the country 's two longest standing disputes : the Beagle Conflict with Chile and the Falkland Islands ( ) with the United Kingdom .", "question": "what was the name of the argentine navy cruiser which was torpedoed and sunk during the 1982 falklands war?", "groundTruth": "manuel belgrano", "answer": "the s/s nova del mar", "modAnswer": "the s/s s/s marino", "delete sentence number": [" Renewed conflicts with Montevideo led to the creation of a second fleet , which participated in the capture of the city .", " Three older ironclads , , , and dated from the 1880s and early 1890s .", "   20th century   Argentina remained neutral in both world wars .", " A ten-year building programme costing $ 60 million had produced a force of 14,500 sailors and over a thousand officers .", " With Brazil , Argentina is one of two South American countries to have operated two aircraft carriers : the and .", "   The Navy also took part in all military coups through the 20th century .", " The Naval Mechanics School , known as ESMA , was a notorious centre for torture ."], "distance value": [[8, 0.5780176520347595], [23, 0.5674508810043335], [28, 0.5588721036911011], [2, 0.5427201390266418], [9, 0.5253869295120239], [19, 0.5132833123207092], [0, 0.49965956807136536], [20, 0.4823349416255951], [11, 0.4799571931362152], [10, 0.47903454303741455], [1, 0.47414276003837585], [21, 0.4709010124206543], [4, 0.46406090259552], [14, 0.43530312180519104], [5, 0.4309110641479492], [17, 0.42288580536842346], [15, 0.4101516008377075], [3, 0.39359214901924133], [25, 0.37765419483184814], [12, 0.36928611993789673], [27, 0.35942506790161133], [7, 0.3495570421218872], [6, 0.347007155418396], [24, 0.3438844382762909], [22, 0.3167259097099304], [26, 0.3090797960758209], [18, 0.30433735251426697], [16, 0.2863413095474243], [13, 0.16955097019672394]]}

In July 1928 , while considering post-graduate study in that field , he was recruited into the Circus by his tutor Jebedee .

{"test case number": 469, "context": "A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft , as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft , whose main mission is to attack ground targets . The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed , maneuverability , and small size relative to other combat aircraft .   Many fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities , and some are designed as dual-purpose fighter-bombers ; often aircraft that do not fulfill the standard definition are called fighters . This may be for political or national security reasons , for advertising purposes , or other reasons .   A fighter 's main purpose is to establish air superiority over a battlefield . Since World War I , achieving and maintaining air superiority has been considered essential for victory in conventional warfare . The success or failure of a belligerent 's efforts to gain air supremacy hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots , the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters , and the numbers and performance of those fighters . Because of the importance of air superiority , since the dawn of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers , and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces .   Terminology   The word `` fighter '' did not become the official English-language term for such aircraft until after World War I . In the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force these aircraft were referred to as `` scouts '' into the early 1920s . The U.S. Army called their fighters `` pursuit '' aircraft from 1916 until the late 1940s . In most languages a fighter aircraft is known as a hunter , or hunting aircraft ( avion de chasse , jagdflugzeuge , avi\u00f3n de caza etc . ) . Exceptions include Russian , where a fighter is an `` \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c '' ( pronounced `` istrebitel '' ) , meaning `` exterminator '' , and Hebrew where it is `` matose krav '' ( literally `` battle plane '' ) .   As a part of military nomenclature , a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use , along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft . The letters used to designate a fighter differ in various countries \u2014 in the English-speaking world , `` F '' is now used to indicate a fighter ( e.g . F-35 or Spitfire F.22 ) , though when the pursuit designation was used in the US , they were `` P '' types ( e.g . P-40 ) . In Russia `` I '' was used ( I-16 ) , while the French continue to use `` C '' ( Nieuport 17 C.1 ) .   Although the term `` fighter '' specifies aircraft designed to shoot down other aircraft , such designs are often also useful as multirole fighter-bombers , strike fighters , and sometimes lighter , fighter-sized tactical ground-attack aircraft . This has always been the case , for instance the Sopwith Camel and other `` fighting scouts '' of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work . In World War II , the USAAF and RAF often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or dive bombers , and types such as the P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Hurricane that were no longer competitive aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack . Several aircraft , such as the F-111 and F-117 , have received fighter designations but had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons . The F-111B variant was originally intended for a fighter role with the U.S. Navy , but it was cancelled . This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for `` attack '' or `` strike '' operations against ground targets by means of strafing or dropping small bombs and incendiaries . Versatile multirole fighter-bombers such as the F/A-18 Hornet are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types .   Some of the most expensive fighters such as the US F-14 Tomcat , F-15 Eagle , F-22 Raptor and Russian Su-27 were employed as all-weather interceptors as well as air superiority fighter aircraft , while commonly developing air-to-ground roles late in their careers . An interceptor is generally an aircraft intended to target ( or intercept ) bombers and so often trades maneuverability for climb rate .   Development overview   Fighters were developed in World War I to deny enemy aircraft and dirigibles the ability to gather information by reconnaissance .", "modContext": "A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft , as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft , whose main mission is to attack ground targets .

The success or failure of a belligerent 's efforts to gain air supremacy hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots , the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters , and the numbers and performance of those fighters . Because of the importance of air superiority , since the dawn of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers , and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces .   Terminology   The word `` fighter '' did not become the official English-language term for such aircraft until after World War I .S. Army called their fighters `` pursuit '' aircraft from 1916 until the late 1940s . In most languages a fighter aircraft is known as a hunter , or hunting aircraft ( avion de chasse , jagdflugzeuge , avi\u00f3n de caza etc . Exceptions include Russian , where a fighter is an `` \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c '' ( pronounced `` istrebitel '' ) , meaning `` exterminator '' , and Hebrew where it is `` matose krav '' ( literally `` battle plane '' ) .   As a part of military nomenclature , a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use , along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft .g . F-35 or Spitfire F. In Russia `` I '' was used ( I-16 ) , while the French continue to use `` C '' ( Nieuport 17 C.1 ) . This has always been the case , for instance the Sopwith Camel and other `` fighting scouts '' of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work . In World War II , the USAAF and RAF often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or dive bombers , and types such as the P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Hurricane that were no longer competitive aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack . Several aircraft , such as the F-111 and F-117 , have received fighter designations but had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons .S. Navy , but it was cancelled . This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for `` attack '' or `` strike '' operations against ground targets by means of strafing or dropping small bombs and incendiaries . Versatile multirole fighter-bombers such as the F/A-18 Hornet are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types .   Some of the most expensive fighters such as the US F-14 Tomcat , F-15 Eagle , F-22 Raptor and Russian Su-27 were employed as all-weather interceptors as well as air superiority fighter aircraft , while commonly developing air-to-ground roles late in their careers . An interceptor is generally an aircraft intended to target ( or intercept ) bombers and so often trades maneuverability for climb rate .   Development overview   Fighters were developed in World War I to deny enemy aircraft and dirigibles the ability to gather information by reconnaissance .", "question": "britain's first jet fighter, the meteor was made by which company?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "Royal Air Force", "modAnswer": "luftwaffe", "delete sentence number": [" In the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force these aircraft were referred to as `` scouts '' into the early 1920s .", " The U.", " ) .", " The letters used to designate a fighter differ in various countries \u2014 in the English-speaking world , `` F '' is now used to indicate a fighter ( e.", "22 ) , though when the pursuit designation was used in the US , they were `` P '' types ( e.", "g .", " P-40 ) .", "   Although the term `` fighter '' specifies aircraft designed to shoot down other aircraft , such designs are often also useful as multirole fighter-bombers , strike fighters , and sometimes lighter , fighter-sized tactical ground-attack aircraft .", " The F-111B variant was originally intended for a fighter role with the U."], "distance value": [[8, 0.4587477445602417], [9, 0.45683789253234863], [12, 0.44666534662246704], [27, 0.4397340416908264], [34, 0.4365769624710083], [36, 0.40363502502441406], [13, 0.3886317014694214], [29, 0.38777318596839905], [33, 0.3794407844543457], [4, 0.359131395816803], [17, 0.35697680711746216], [25, 0.35595035552978516], [16, 0.35394957661628723], [6, 0.3407926559448242], [1, 0.33796030282974243], [19, 0.3354116380214691], [28, 0.33306121826171875], [7, 0.3144751489162445], [5, 0.31158435344696045], [35, 0.3083425760269165], [0, 0.29986751079559326], [2, 0.2984599471092224], [32, 0.2673609256744385], [31, 0.23471426963806152], [3, 0.2095378339290619], [14, 0.20787090063095093], [20, 0.20768436789512634], [24, 0.20111842453479767], [10, 0.18351183831691742], [11, 0.17052246630191803], [30, 0.17052246630191803], [15, 0.15899470448493958], [26, 0.15529176592826843], [22, 0.14901745319366455], [23, 0.1270839422941208], [21, 0.048301734030246735], [18, 0.048301734030246735]]}

The inaugural tournament was restricted to professionals and attracted a field of eight golfers who played three rounds of Prestwick 's twelve-hole course in a single day .

James Ogilvie Fairlie was the principal organiser of the first Open Championship held at Prestwick in 1860 . With the untimely death of Allan Robertson , aged 43 in 1859 , Prestwick members decided to conduct a challenge the following year that would determine the land \u2019 s greatest golfer . In a proposed competition for a `` Challenge Belt '' , Fairlie sent out a series of letters to Blackheath , Perth , Edinburgh , Musselburgh and St Andrews , inviting a player known as a `` respectable caddie '' to represent each of the clubs in a tournament to be held on 17 October 1860 .   Originally , the trophy presented to the event 's winner was the Challenge Belt , a red leather belt with a silver buckle . The Challenge Belt was retired in 1870 , when Young Tom Morris was allowed to keep it for winning the tournament three consecutive times . Because no trophy was available , the tournament was cancelled in 1871 . In 1872 , after Young Tom Morris won again for a fourth time in a row , he was awarded a medal . The present trophy , The Golf Champion Trophy , better known by its popular name of the Claret Jug , was then created .   Prestwick administered The Open from 1860 to 1870 . In 1871 , it agreed to organise it jointly with The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers .

Under Blair 's leadership , the party used the phrase `` New Labour '' , to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism . Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as `` social-ism '' , involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent , and advocated social justice , cohesion , equal worth of each citizen , and equal opportunity . Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism .   In May 1997 , the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory , the largest in its history , allowing Blair , at 43 years old , to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812 .

In the first years of the New Labour government , Blair 's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act , Human Rights Act , and Freedom of Information Act . Blair 's government also carried out the devolution , the establishing of the Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales , and the Northern Ireland Assembly , thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto . In Northern Ireland , Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement .   Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W.

{"test case number": 478, "context": "A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative , often serialized , with text in balloons and captions . Traditionally , throughout the 20th century and into the 21st , these have been published in newspapers and magazines , with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers , while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections . With the development of the internet , they began to appear online as web comics .   There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century , for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes .   Strips are written and drawn by a comics artist or cartoonist . As the name implies , comic strips can be humorous ( for example , `` gag-a-day '' strips such as Blondie , Bringing Up Father , Marmaduke , and Pearls Before Swine ) .   Starting in the late 1920s , comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories , as seen in Popeye , Captain Easy , Buck Rogers , Tarzan , and The Adventures of Tintin . Soap-opera continuity strips such as Judge Parker and Mary Worth gained popularity in the 1940s . All are called , generically , comic strips , though cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that `` sequential art '' would be a better genre-neutral name .   In the UK and the rest of Europe , comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines , with a strip 's story sometimes continuing over three pages or more . Comic strips have appeared in American magazines such as Liberty and Boys ' Life and also on the front covers of magazines , such as the Flossy Frills series on The American Weekly Sunday newspaper supplement .   History   Storytelling using a sequence of pictures has existed through history . One medieval European example in textile form is the Bayeux Tapestry . Printed examples emerged in 19th-century Germany and in 18th-century England , where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced . William Hogarth 's 18th century English cartoons include both narrative sequences , such as A Rake 's Progress , and single panels .   The Biblia pauperum ( `` Paupers ' Bible '' ) , a tradition of picture Bibles beginning in the later Middle Ages , sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the miniatures written on scrolls coming out of their mouths\u2014which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips .   In China , with its traditions of block printing and of the incorporation of text with image , experiments with what became lianhuanhua date back to 1884 .   Newspapers   The first newspaper comic strips appeared in North America in the late 19th century . The Yellow Kid is usually credited as the first . However , the art form combining words and pictures developed gradually and there are many examples which led up to the comic strip .   Swiss author and caricature artist Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer ( Geneva , 1799\u20131846 ) is considered the father of the modern comic strips . His illustrated stories such as Histoire de M. Vieux Bois ( 1827 ) , first published in the USA in 1842 as The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck or Histoire de Monsieur Jabot ( 1831 ) , inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists . In 1865 , German painter , author , and caricaturist Wilhelm Busch created the strip Max and Moritz , about two trouble-making boys , which had a direct influence on the American comic strip . Max and Moritz was a series of severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children 's stories such as Struwwelpeter ( `` Shockheaded Peter '' ) ; in one , the boys , after perpetrating some mischief , are tossed into a sack of grain , run through a mill , and consumed by a flock of geese . Max and Moritz provided an inspiration for German immigrant Rudolph Dirks , who created the Katzenjammer Kids in 1897 . Familiar comic-strip iconography such as stars for pain , sawing logs for snoring , speech balloons , and thought balloons originated in Dirks ' strip .   Hugely popular , Katzenjammer Kids occasioned one of the first comic-strip copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium . When Dirks left William Randolph Hearst for the promise of a better salary under Joseph Pulitzer , it was an unusual move", "modContext": "A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative , often serialized , with text in balloons and captions . Traditionally , throughout the 20th century and into the 21st , these have been published in newspapers and magazines , with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers , while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections . With the development of the internet , they began to appear online as web comics .   Strips are written and drawn by a comics artist or cartoonist . As the name implies , comic strips can be humorous ( for example , `` gag-a-day '' strips such as Blondie , Bringing Up Father , Marmaduke , and Pearls Before Swine ) .   Starting in the late 1920s , comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories , as seen in Popeye , Captain Easy , Buck Rogers , Tarzan , and The Adventures of Tintin . Soap-opera continuity strips such as Judge Parker and Mary Worth gained popularity in the 1940s . All are called , generically , comic strips , though cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that `` sequential art '' would be a better genre-neutral name .   In the UK and the rest of Europe , comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines , with a strip 's story sometimes continuing over three pages or more . Comic strips have appeared in American magazines such as Liberty and Boys ' Life and also on the front covers of magazines , such as the Flossy Frills series on The American Weekly Sunday newspaper supplement .

Located at the crossroads of Western Asia and Eastern Europe , it is bounded to the west by the Black Sea , to the north by Russia , to the south by Turkey and Armenia , and to the southeast by Azerbaijan . The capital and largest city is Tbilisi . Georgia covers a territory of 69700 km\u00b2 , and its 2015 population is about 3.75 million . Georgia is a unitary , semi-presidential republic , with the government elected through a representative democracy .   During the classical era , several independent kingdoms became established in what is now Georgia . The kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia adopted Christianity in the early 4th century . A unified Kingdom of Georgia reached the peak of its political and economic strength during the reign of King David IV and Queen Tamar in the 11th\u201312th centuries . Thereafter the area was dominated by various large empires for centuries , including the Mongols , the Ottoman Empire , and successive dynasties of Iran . In the late 18th century , the kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti forged an alliance with the Russian Empire , and the area was annexed by Russia in 1801 . The latter 's rule over Georgia was confirmed in 1813 through the Treaty of Gulistan with Qajar Iran . Following the Russian Revolution in 1917 , Georgia obtained independence , though only briefly , and established its first-ever republic under German and British protection , only to be invaded by Soviet Russia in 1921 and subsequently absorbed into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic .   After restoring its independence once again in 1991 , post-communist Georgia suffered from civil and economic crisis for most of the 1990s . This lasted until the peaceful Rose Revolution , when Georgia pursued a strongly pro-Western foreign policy , introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at NATO and European integration . The country 's Western orientation soon led to the worsening of relations with Russia , culminating in the brief Russo-Georgian War .   Georgia is a member of the Council of Europe and the GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development .

{"test case number": 499, "context": "West Africa , also called Western Africa and the West of Africa , is the westernmost subcontinent of Africa . West Africa has been defined as including the 18 countries Benin , Burkina Faso , the island of Cape Verde , Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , the island of Saint Helena , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Sao Tome and Principe and Togo .   History   The history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods : first , its prehistory , in which the first human settlers arrived , developed agriculture , and made contact with peoples to the north ; the second , the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-African , and extra-African trade , and developed centralized states ; third , major polities flourished , which would undergo an extensive history of contact with non-Africans ; fourth , the colonial period , in which Great Britain and France controlled nearly the whole of the region ; and fifth , the post-independence era , in which the current nations were formed .   Prehistory   Early human settlers from northern Holocene societies arrived in West Africa around 12,000 B.C . Sedentary farming began in , or around the fifth millennium B.C , as well as the domestication of cattle . By 1500 B.C , ironworking technology allowed an expansion of agricultural productivity , and the first city-states later formed . Northern tribes developed walled settlements and non-walled settlements that numbered at 400 . In the forest region , Iron Age cultures began to flourish , and an inter-region trade began to appear . The desertification of the Sahara and the climatic change of the coast cause trade with upper Mediterranean peoples to be seen .   The domestication of the camel allowed the development of a trans-Saharan trade with cultures across the Sahara , including Carthage and the Berbers ; major exports included gold , cotton cloth , metal ornaments and leather goods , which were then exchanged for salt , horses , textiles , and other such materials . Local leather , cloth , and gold also contributed to the abundance of prosperity for many of the following empires .   Empires   The development of the region 's economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form , beginning with the Nok culture that began in 1000 B.C . and the Ghana Empire that first flourished between the 1st and 3rd centuries , which later gave way to the Mali Empire . In current-day Mauritania , there exist archaeological sites in the towns of Tichit and Oualata that were initially constructed around 2000 B.C. , and were found to have originated from the Soninke branch of the Mand\u00e9 peoples .

West Africa has been defined as including the 18 countries Benin , Burkina Faso , the island of Cape Verde , Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , the island of Saint Helena , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Sao Tome and Principe and Togo .   History   The history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods : first , its prehistory , in which the first human settlers arrived , developed agriculture , and made contact with peoples to the north ; the second , the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-African , and extra-African trade , and developed centralized states ; and fifth , the post-independence era , in which the current nations were formed .C , as well as the domestication of cattle . By 1500 B.C , ironworking technology allowed an expansion of agricultural productivity , and the first city-states later formed . Northern tribes developed walled settlements and non-walled settlements that numbered at 400 . In the forest region , Iron Age cultures began to flourish , and an inter-region trade began to appear .   The domestication of the camel allowed the development of a trans-Saharan trade with cultures across the Sahara , including Carthage and the Berbers ; major exports included gold , cotton cloth , metal ornaments and leather goods , which were then exchanged for salt , horses , textiles , and other such materials .   Empires   The development of the region 's economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form , beginning with the Nok culture that began in 1000 B.C . and the Ghana Empire that first flourished between the 1st and 3rd centuries , which later gave way to the Mali Empire . In current-day Mauritania , there exist archaeological sites in the towns of Tichit and Oualata that were initially constructed around 2000 B.C. , and were found to have originated from the Soninke branch of the Mand\u00e9 peoples .

Tutu 's admirers see him as a great man who , since the demise of apartheid , has been active in the defence of human rights and uses his high profile to campaign for the oppressed . He has campaigned to fight HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis , poverty , racism , sexism , homophobia and transphobia . He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 ; the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism in 1986 ; the Pacem in Terris Award in 1987 ; the Sydney Peace Prize in 1999 ; the Gandhi Peace Prize in 2007 ; and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 . He has also compiled several books of his speeches and sayings .   Early life   Desmond Mpilo Tutu was born in Klerksdorp , Transvaal , the second of four children of Zacheriah Zililo Tutu and his wife , Aletta Tutu , and the only son . Tutu 's family moved to Johannesburg when he was twelve . His father was a teacher and his mother was a cleaner and cook at a school for the blind . Here he met Trevor Huddleston , who was a parish priest in the black slum of Sophiatown . `` One day , '' said Tutu , `` I was standing in the street with my mother when a white man in a priest 's clothing walked past .

''   Although Tutu wanted to become a doctor , his family could not afford the training , and he followed his father 's footsteps into teaching . Tutu studied at the Pretoria Bantu Normal College from 1951 to 1953 , and went on to teach at Johannesburg Bantu High School and at Munsienville High School in Mogale City . However , he resigned following the passage of the Bantu Education Act , in protest of the poor educational prospects for black South Africans . He continued his studies , this time in theology , at St Peter 's Theological College in Rosettenville , Johannesburg , and in December 1961 was ordained as an Anglican priest following in the footsteps of his mentor and fellow activist , Trevor Huddleston .   Tutu then travelled to King 's College London , ( 1962\u20131966 ) , where he received his bachelor 's and master 's degrees in theology . During this time he worked as a part-time curate , first at St Alban 's Church , Golders Green , and then at St Mary 's Church in Bletchingley , Surrey . He later returned to South Africa and became chaplain at the University of Fort Hare in 1967 . From 1970 to 1972 , Tutu lectured at the National University of Lesotho .   In 1972 , Tutu returned to the UK , where he was appointed vice-director of the Theological Education Fund of the World Council of Churches , at Bromley in Kent . He returned to South Africa in 1975 and was appointed Dean of St Mary 's Cathedral in Johannesburg .   Personal life   On 2 July 1955 , Tutu married Nomalizo Leah Shenxane , a teacher whom he had met while at college .

{"test case number": 555, "context": "In musical terminology , tempo ( `` time '' in Italian ; plural : tempi ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof , how fast or slow . Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute , with the beats being a division of the measures , though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication . Tempo may be separated from articulation , or articulation may be indicated along with tempo , and tempo contributes to the overall texture . While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill , tempo is changeable , and often indicated by a conductor or drummer . While practicing , an electronic or mechanical device , a metronome , may indicate the tempo , as one usually works one 's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo .   Measuring tempo   A piece of music 's tempo is typically written at the start of the score , and in modern Western music is usually indicated in beats per minute ( bpm ) . This means that a particular note value ( for example , a quarter note , or crotchet ) is specified as the beat , and that the amount of time between successive beats is a specified fraction of a minute . The greater the number of beats per minute , the smaller the amount of time between successive beats , and thus faster a piece must be played . For example , a tempo of 60 beats per minute signifies one beat per second , while a tempo of 120 beats per minute is twice as rapid , signifying one beat every 0.5 seconds . Mathematical tempo markings of this kind became increasingly popular during the first half of the 19th century , after the metronome had been invented by Johann Nepomuk Maelzel , although early metronomes were somewhat inconsistent . Beethoven was one of the first composers to use the metronome ; in the 1810s he published metronomic indications for the eight symphonies he had composed up to that time.Some of these markings are today contentious , such as those on his `` Hammerklavier '' Sonata and Ninth Symphony , seeming to many to be almost impossibly fast , as is also the case for many of the works of Schumann . See `` metronome '' entry in Apel ( 1969 ) , p. 523 .   With the advent of modern electronics , bpm became an extremely precise measure . Music sequencers use the bpm system to denote tempo .   Instead of beats per minute , some 20th-century composers ( e.g. , B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k , Alberto Ginastera , and John Cage ) specify the total playing time for a piece , from which the performer can derive tempo .   Tempo is as crucial in contemporary music as it is in classical . In electronic dance music , accurate knowledge of a tune 's bpm is important to DJs for the purposes of beatmatching .   Musical vocabulary for tempo   Some musical pieces do not have a mathematical time indication . In classical music it is customary to describe the tempo of a piece by one or more words . Most of these words are Italian , because many of the most important composers of the 17th century were Italian , and this period was when tempo indications were first used extensively and codified .   Before the metronome , it was difficult to specify the tempo of a composition ; attempts were made using pendulums or the human pulse . Yet , after the metronome 's invention , musicians continued to use these words , often additionally indicating the mood of the piece . This blurred the traditional distinction between tempo and mood indicators . For example , presto and allegro both indicate a speedy execution ( presto being faster ) , but allegro also connotes joy ( from its original meaning in Italian ) . Presto , on the other hand , simply indicates speed . Additional Italian words also indicate tempo and mood . For example , the `` agitato '' in the Allegro agitato of the last movement of George Gershwin 's piano concerto in F has both a tempo indication ( undoubtedly faster than a usual Allegro ) and a mood indication ( `` agitated '' ) .

{"test case number": 595, "context": "An embryo is a multicellular diploid eukaryote in an early stage of embryogenesis , or development . In general , in organisms that reproduce sexually , an embryo develops from a zygote , the single cell resulting from the fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell . The zygote possesses half the DNA of each of its two parents . In plants , animals , and some protists , the zygote will begin to divide by mitosis to produce a multicellular organism . The result of this process is an embryo .   In humans , a pregnancy is generally considered to be in the embryonic stage of development between the fifth and the eleventh weeks after fertilization , and is considered a fetus from the twelfth week on .   Etymology   First attested in English in the mid-14c. , the word embryon derives from Medieval Latin embryo , itself from Greek ( embruon ) , lit . `` young one '' , which is the neuter of ( embruos ) , lit . `` growing in '' , from \u1f10\u03bd ( en ) , `` in '' and \u03b2\u03c1\u03cd\u03c9 ( bru\u014d ) , `` swell , be full '' ; the proper Latinized form of the Greek term would be embryum .   Development   In animals , the development of the zygote into an embryo proceeds through specific recognizable stages of blastula , gastrula , and organogenesis . The blastula stage typically features a fluid-filled cavity , the blastocoel , surrounded by a sphere or sheet of cells , also called blastomeres . In a placental mammal , an ovum is fertilized in a fallopian tube through which it travels into the uterus . An embryo is called a fetus at a more advanced stage of development and up until birth or hatching . In humans , this is from the eleventh week of gestation . However , animals which develop in eggs outside the mother 's body , are usually referred to as embryos throughout development ; e.g . one would refer to a chick embryo , not a `` chick fetus , '' even at later stages .   During gastrulation the cells of the blastula undergo coordinated processes of cell division , invasion , and/or migration to form two ( diploblastic ) or three ( triploblastic ) tissue layers . In triploblastic organisms , the three germ layers are called endoderm , ectoderm , and mesoderm . The position and arrangement of the germ layers are highly species-specific , however , depending on the type of embryo produced . In vertebrates , a special population of embryonic cells called the neural crest has been proposed as a `` fourth germ layer '' , and is thought to have been an important novelty in the evolution of head structures .   During organogenesis , molecular and cellular interactions between germ layers , combined with the cells ' developmental potential , or competence to respond , prompt the further differentiation of organ-specific cell types . For example , in neurogenesis , a subpopulation of ectoderm cells is set aside to become the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral nerves . Modern developmental biology is extensively probing the molecular basis for every type of organogenesis , including angiogenesis ( formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones ) , chondrogenesis ( cartilage ) , myogenesis ( muscle ) , osteogenesis ( bone ) , and many others .   Generally , if a structure pre-dates another structure in evolutionary terms , then it often appears earlier than the second in an embryo ; this general observation is sometimes summarized by the phrase `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' . For example , the backbone is a common structure among all vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , and mammals , and the backbone also appears as one of the earliest structures laid out in all vertebrate embryos . The cerebrum in humans , which is the most sophisticated part of the brain , develops last . This sequencing rule is not absolute , but it is recognized as being partly applicable to development of the human embryo .   Plant embryos   In botany , a seed plant embryo is part of a seed , consisting of precursor tissues for the leaves , stem ( see hypocotyl ) , and root ( see radicle ) , as well as one or more cotyledons . Once the embryo begins to germinate \u2014 grow out from the seed \u2014 it is called a seedling ( plantlet ) .   Bryophytes and ferns also produce an embryo , but do not produce seeds .

For example , in neurogenesis , a subpopulation of ectoderm cells is set aside to become the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral nerves . Modern developmental biology is extensively probing the molecular basis for every type of organogenesis , including angiogenesis ( formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones ) , chondrogenesis ( cartilage ) , myogenesis ( muscle ) , osteogenesis ( bone ) , and many others . this general observation is sometimes summarized by the phrase `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny '' . For example , the backbone is a common structure among all vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , and mammals , and the backbone also appears as one of the earliest structures laid out in all vertebrate embryos . The cerebrum in humans , which is the most sophisticated part of the brain , develops last . This sequencing rule is not absolute , but it is recognized as being partly applicable to development of the human embryo .   Plant embryos   In botany , a seed plant embryo is part of a seed , consisting of precursor tissues for the leaves , stem ( see hypocotyl ) , and root ( see radicle ) , as well as one or more cotyledons . Once the embryo begins to germinate \u2014 grow out from the seed \u2014 it is called a seedling ( plantlet ) .

Bond is assigned the task of following a general who is stealing jewels and relics from the Soviet government . This leads him to a wealthy Afghan prince , Kamal Khan , and his associate , Octopussy . Bond uncovers a plot to force disarmament in Europe with the use of a nuclear weapon .   Octopussy was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson , and was released in the same year as the non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again . The film was written by George MacDonald Fraser , Richard Maibaum , and Michael G. Wilson , and was directed by John Glen .   Plot   British agent 009 is found dead at the British embassy in East Berlin , dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Faberg\u00e9 egg . MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and , after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London , sends James Bond to investigate and find out the identity of the seller . At the auction , Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan , forcing Khan to pay \u00a3500,000 for the fake egg . Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan , India , where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon . Bond escapes with his Indian colleague Vijay , evading Khan 's bodyguard Gobinda 's attempts to kill them both . Bond is seduced by one of Khan 's associates , Magda , and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo . Bond permits Magda to steal the real Faberg\u00e9 egg fitted with a listening device by Q , while Gobinda captures Bond and takes him to Khan 's palace . After Bond escapes from his cell he listens in on the bug in the Faberg\u00e9 egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov , a Soviet general , who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe .   After escaping from Khan 's palace , Bond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur , India , and there finds its owner , Octopussy , a wealthy business woman and smuggler and an associate of Khan . She also leads the Octopus cult , of which Magda is a member . In Octopussy 's palace , Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures , replacing them with replicas while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West via Octopussy 's circus troupe . Orlov is planning to meet Khan at Karl-Marx-Stadt ( Chemnitz ) in East Germany , where the circus is scheduled to perform . After evading Khan 's assassins , who killed Vijay , Bond goes to East Germany .   Bond infiltrates the circus and finds that Orlov replaced the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead , primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany . The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament in the belief that the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident , leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion . Bond takes Orlov 's car , drives it along the train tracks and boards the moving circus train . Orlov is shot dead by GDR guards while trying to follow the train across the border into West Germany , who assume that he is attempting to defect to the West .

This leads him to a wealthy Afghan prince , Kamal Khan , and his associate , Octopussy . Bond uncovers a plot to force disarmament in Europe with the use of a nuclear weapon .   Octopussy was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson , and was released in the same year as the non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again . The film was written by George MacDonald Fraser , Richard Maibaum , and Michael G. Wilson , and was directed by John Glen . Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan , India , where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon . Bond escapes with his Indian colleague Vijay , evading Khan 's bodyguard Gobinda 's attempts to kill them both . Bond is seduced by one of Khan 's associates , Magda , and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo . Bond permits Magda to steal the real Faberg\u00e9 egg fitted with a listening device by Q , while Gobinda captures Bond and takes him to Khan 's palace . After Bond escapes from his cell he listens in on the bug in the Faberg\u00e9 egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov , a Soviet general , who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe .   After escaping from Khan 's palace , Bond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur , India , and there finds its owner , Octopussy , a wealthy business woman and smuggler and an associate of Khan . In Octopussy 's palace , Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures , replacing them with replicas while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West via Octopussy 's circus troupe . After evading Khan 's assassins , who killed Vijay , Bond goes to East Germany .   Bond infiltrates the circus and finds that Orlov replaced the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead , primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany . Bond takes Orlov 's car , drives it along the train tracks and boards the moving circus train . Bond kills the twin knife-throwers Mischka and Grischka in revenge for 009 's death , and , after falling from the train , commandeers a car to get to the Air Force base . At the base , Bond disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police .", "question": "former tennis player vijay armitrage apears in which james bond film?", "groundTruth": "octopussy", "answer": "the sixth film in the series", "modAnswer": "Octopussy", "delete sentence number": ["   Plot   British agent 009 is found dead at the British embassy in East Berlin , dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Faberg\u00e9 egg .", " MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and , after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London , sends James Bond to investigate and find out the identity of the seller .", " At the auction , Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan , forcing Khan to pay \u00a3500,000 for the fake egg .", " She also leads the Octopus cult , of which Magda is a member .", " Orlov is planning to meet Khan at Karl-Marx-Stadt ( Chemnitz ) in East Germany , where the circus is scheduled to perform .", " The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament in the belief that the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident , leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion .", " Orlov is shot dead by GDR guards while trying to follow the train across the border into West Germany , who assume that he is attempting to defect to the West ."], "distance value": [[0, 0.455990731716156], [14, 0.43369099497795105], [8, 0.4123058021068573], [16, 0.3898649215698242], [1, 0.3746258020401001], [15, 0.36719465255737305], [19, 0.34017419815063477], [28, 0.33361008763313293], [9, 0.329762727022171], [21, 0.3277369737625122], [23, 0.3243020176887512], [3, 0.3210926055908203], [10, 0.2858962416648865], [24, 0.27821508049964905], [29, 0.26495489478111267], [26, 0.2568640112876892], [6, 0.25599440932273865], [7, 0.2540262043476105], [17, 0.2539469003677368], [5, 0.25355061888694763], [4, 0.2400558590888977], [18, 0.237290620803833], [2, 0.22462742030620575], [13, 0.22342051565647125], [12, 0.22010713815689087], [11, 0.17642441391944885], [22, 0.09895825386047363], [20, 0.07698260992765427], [27, 0.05440407991409302], [25, -0.002150743268430233]]}

The maximum cash prize ( in the original British version ) was one million pounds . Most international versions offer a top prize of one million units of the local currency ; the actual value of the prize varies widely , depending on the value of the currency .

{"test case number": 645, "context": "The Hobbit , or There and Back Again is a children 's fantasy novel by English author J. R. R. Tolkien . It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim , being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction . The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children 's literature .   Set in a time `` Between the Dawn of F\u00e6rie and the Dominion of Men '' , The Hobbit follows the quest of home-loving hobbit Bilbo Baggins to win a share of the treasure guarded by the dragon , Smaug . Bilbo 's journey takes him from light-hearted , rural surroundings into more sinister territory . The story is told in the form of an episodic quest , and most chapters introduce a specific creature , or type of creature , of Tolkien 's geography . By accepting the disreputable , romantic , fey and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense , Bilbo gains a new level of maturity , competence and wisdom . The story reaches its climax in the Battle of the Five Armies , where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict .   Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story . Along with motifs of warfare , these themes have led critics to view Tolkien 's own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story . The author 's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences .   Encouraged by the book 's critical and financial success , the publisher requested a sequel . As Tolkien 's work on the successor The Lord of the Rings progressed , he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit . These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition . Further editions followed with minor emendations , including those reflecting Tolkien 's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled . The work has never been out of print . Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage , screen , radio , board games and video games . Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits .   Characters   Bilbo Baggins , the titular protagonist , is a respectable , reserved hobbit . During his adventure , Bilbo often refers to the contents of his larder at home and wishes he had more food . Until he finds a magic ring , he is more baggage than help . Gandalf , an itinerant wizard , introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves . During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at , only to appear again at key moments in the story . Thorin Oakenshield , the proud , pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain , makes many mistakes in his leadership , relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to get him out of trouble , but he proves himself a mighty warrior . Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin 's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure .   The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance , such as the twelve other dwarves of the company ; two types of elves : both puckish and more serious warrior types ; Men ; man-eating trolls ; boulder-throwing giants ; evil cave-dwelling goblins ; forest-dwelling giant spiders who can speak ; immense and heroic eagles who also speak ; evil wolves , or wargs , who are allied with the goblins ; Elrond the sage ; Gollum , a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake ; Beorn , a man who can assume bear form ; and Bard the Bowman , a grim but honourable archer of Lake-town .   Plot   Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of dwarves , who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the dragon Smaug . When the music ends , Gandalf unveils a map showing a secret door into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition 's `` burglar '' . The dwarves ridicule the idea , but Bilbo , indignant , joins despite himself .   The group travels into the wild , where Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to Rivendell , where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map .

The story reaches its climax in the Battle of the Five Armies , where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict .   Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story . Along with motifs of warfare , these themes have led critics to view Tolkien 's own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story . The author 's scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences .   Encouraged by the book 's critical and financial success , the publisher requested a sequel . As Tolkien 's work on the successor The Lord of the Rings progressed , he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit . These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition . Further editions followed with minor emendations , including those reflecting Tolkien 's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled . Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage , screen , radio , board games and video games . Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits .   Characters   Bilbo Baggins , the titular protagonist , is a respectable , reserved hobbit . Gandalf , an itinerant wizard , introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves . During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at , only to appear again at key moments in the story . Thorin Oakenshield , the proud , pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain , makes many mistakes in his leadership , relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to get him out of trouble , but he proves himself a mighty warrior .   The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance , such as the twelve other dwarves of the company ; two types of elves : both puckish and more serious warrior types ; Men ; man-eating trolls ; boulder-throwing giants ; evil cave-dwelling goblins ; forest-dwelling giant spiders who can speak ; immense and heroic eagles who also speak ; evil wolves , or wargs , who are allied with the goblins ; Elrond the sage ; Gollum , a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake ; Beorn , a man who can assume bear form ; and Bard the Bowman , a grim but honourable archer of Lake-town .   Plot   Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of dwarves , who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the dragon Smaug . When the music ends , Gandalf unveils a map showing a secret door into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition 's `` burglar '' . The dwarves ridicule the idea , but Bilbo , indignant , joins despite himself .   The group travels into the wild , where Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to Rivendell , where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map .", "question": "\"how many films were made by director sir peter jackson from tolkien's short book, \"\"the hobbit\"\"?\"", "groundTruth": "3", "answer": "three", "modAnswer": "12", "delete sentence number": [" R.", " R.", " Bilbo 's journey takes him from light-hearted , rural surroundings into more sinister territory .", " By accepting the disreputable , romantic , fey and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense , Bilbo gains a new level of maturity , competence and wisdom .", " The work has never been out of print .", " During his adventure , Bilbo often refers to the contents of his larder at home and wishes he had more food .", " Until he finds a magic ring , he is more baggage than help .", " Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin 's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure ."], "distance value": [[3, 0.5651897192001343], [15, 0.5597021579742432], [8, 0.4775511622428894], [0, 0.4767390191555023], [12, 0.46782636642456055], [17, 0.4655129313468933], [6, 0.39933502674102783], [21, 0.3884658217430115], [5, 0.3638646900653839], [10, 0.3240528106689453], [14, 0.32009896636009216], [28, 0.302480548620224], [25, 0.2558651566505432], [26, 0.23841744661331177], [19, 0.21356269717216492], [29, 0.20679764449596405], [4, 0.20646530389785767], [31, 0.20571774244308472], [13, 0.19676104187965393], [24, 0.1954486072063446], [30, 0.1912136971950531], [32, 0.19087213277816772], [20, 0.17771178483963013], [11, 0.17734062671661377], [16, 0.1765347123146057], [27, 0.1732597053050995], [22, 0.15943102538585663], [7, 0.14931711554527283], [23, 0.12230195850133896], [18, 0.10398662090301514], [9, 0.05670357868075371], [1, 0.016875427216291428], [2, 0.016875416040420532]]}

Conflict between Great Britain and France broke out in 1754\u20131756 when the British attacked disputed French positions in North America and seized hundreds of French merchant ships . Meanwhile , rising power Prussia was struggling with Austria for dominance within and outside the Holy Roman Empire in central Europe . In 1756 , the major powers `` switched partners '' .   Realizing that war was imminent , Prussia preemptively struck Saxony and quickly overran it . The result caused uproar across Europe . Because of Prussia 's alliance with Britain , Austria formed an alliance with France , seeing an opportunity to recapture Silesia , which had been lost in a previous war . Reluctantly , by following the imperial diet , most of the states of the empire joined Austria 's cause . The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by smaller German states ( especially Hanover ) . Sweden , fearing Prussia 's expansionist tendencies , went to war in 1757 to protect its Baltic dominions , seeing its chance when virtually all of Europe opposed Prussia . Spain , bound by the Pacte de Famille , intervened on behalf of France and together they launched an utterly unsuccessful invasion of Portugal in 1762 . The Russian Empire was originally aligned with Austria , fearing Prussia 's ambition on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , but switched sides upon the succession of Tsar Peter III in 1762 .   Many middle and small powers in Europe , unlike in the previous wars , tried to steer clear away from the escalating conflict , even though they had interests in the conflict or with the belligerents , like Denmark-Norway . The Dutch Republic , a long-time British ally , kept its neutrality intact , fearing the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe , and even tried to prevent Britain 's domination in India . Naples , Sicily , and Savoy , although sided with the Franco-Spanish alliance , declined to join the coalition under fear of British power . The taxation needed for war caused the Russian people considerable hardship , being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by Empress Elizabeth in 1759 to complete her addition to the Winter Palace . Like Sweden , Russia concluded a separate peace with Prussia .   The war ended with the Treaty of Paris between France , Spain and Great Britain and the Treaty of Hubertusburg between Saxony , Austria and Prussia , in 1763 .   The war was successful for Great Britain , which gained the bulk of New France in North America , Spanish Florida , some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies , the colony of Senegal on the West African coast , and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent . The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement ; a subsequent conflict , known as Pontiac 's War , was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status . In Europe , the war began disastrously for Prussia , but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw King Frederick the Great manage to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum .

The conflict split Europe into two coalitions , led by Great Britain on one side and France on the other . For the first time , aiming to curtail Britain and Prussia 's ever-growing might , France formed a grand coalition of its own , which ended with failure as Britain rose as the world 's predominant power , altering the European balance of power .

{"test case number": 676, "context": "A serial killer is a person who murders three or more people , usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification , with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant break ( a `` cooling off period '' ) between them . Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers ; while most set a threshold of three murders , others extend it to four or lessen it to two . The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , for example , defines serial killing as `` a series of two or more murders , committed as separate events , usually , but not always , by one offender acting alone '' .   Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrillseeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion , and the victims may have something in common : age group , appearance , gender , or race , for example .   Serial killing is not the same as mass murdering ( killing numerous people in a given incident ) ; nor is it spree killing ( in which murders are committed in two or more locations , in a short time ) . However , cases of extended bouts of sequential killings over periods of weeks or months with no apparent `` cooling off period '' or `` return to normalcy '' have caused some experts to suggest a hybrid category of `` spree-serial killer '' .   Etymology   The English term and concept of `` serial killer '' are commonly attributed to former FBI Special agent Robert Ressler in 1974 . Author Ann Rule postulates in her book Kiss Me , Kill Me ( 2004 ) that the English-language credit for coining the term serial killer goes to LAPD detective Pierce Brooks , who created the ViCAP system in 1985 . However , in his book Serial Killers : The Method and Madness of Monsters ( 2004 ) , criminal justice historian Peter Vronsky argues that while Ressler might have coined the term serial homicide within law , at Bramshill Police Academy in Britain , the terms serial murder and serial murderer appear in John Brophy 's book The Meaning of Murder ( 1966 ) . In his more recent study , Vronsky states that the term `` serial killing '' first entered into American popular usage when published in the New York Times in the spring of 1981 , to describe Atlanta serial killer Wayne Williams . Subsequently , throughout the 1980s , the term was used in the pages of the New York Times on 233 occasions , but by the end of the 1990s , in the publication 's second decade , the use of the term escalated to 2,514 times in the nation 's `` newspaper of record '' . The German term and concept were coined by the influential Ernst Gennat , who described Peter K\u00fcrten as a Serienm\u00f6rder ( literally `` serial murderer '' ) in his article `` Die D\u00fcsseldorfer Sexualverbrechen '' ( 1930 ) . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the specific term `` serial killer '' first arose abroad in a 1960s German film article written by Siegfried Kracauer about the film M ( 1931 ) , a German expressionist film about a pedophilic Serienm\u00f6rder .   Characteristics   General   Some commonly found characteristics of serial killers include the following :  * They may exhibit varying degrees of mental illness and/or psychopathy , which may contribute to their homicidal behavior .  * * For example , someone who is mentally ill may have psychotic breaks that cause them to believe they are another person or are compelled to murder by other entities .  * * Psychopathic behavior that is consistent with traits common to some serial killers include sensation seeking , a lack of remorse or guilt , impulsivity , the need for control , and predatory behavior . Unlike people with major mental disorders such as schizophrenia , psychopaths can seem normal and often quite charming , a state of adaptation that psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley called the `` mask of sanity '' .  * They were often abused\u2014emotionally , physically and/or sexually\u2014by a family member .  * Serial killers may be more likely to engage in fetishism , partialism or necrophilia , which are paraphilias that involve a strong tendency to experience the object of erotic interest almost as if it were a physical", "modContext": "A serial killer is a person who murders three or more people , usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification , with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant break ( a `` cooling off period '' ) between them .

Serial killing is not the same as mass murdering ( killing numerous people in a given incident ) ; nor is it spree killing ( in which murders are committed in two or more locations , in a short time ) . However , cases of extended bouts of sequential killings over periods of weeks or months with no apparent `` cooling off period '' or `` return to normalcy '' have caused some experts to suggest a hybrid category of `` spree-serial killer '' .   Etymology   The English term and concept of `` serial killer '' are commonly attributed to former FBI Special agent Robert Ressler in 1974 . Author Ann Rule postulates in her book Kiss Me , Kill Me ( 2004 ) that the English-language credit for coining the term serial killer goes to LAPD detective Pierce Brooks , who created the ViCAP system in 1985 . Subsequently , throughout the 1980s , the term was used in the pages of the New York Times on 233 occasions , but by the end of the 1990s , in the publication 's second decade , the use of the term escalated to 2,514 times in the nation 's `` newspaper of record '' . The German term and concept were coined by the influential Ernst Gennat , who described Peter K\u00fcrten as a Serienm\u00f6rder ( literally `` serial murderer '' ) in his article `` Die D\u00fcsseldorfer Sexualverbrechen '' ( 1930 ) . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the specific term `` serial killer '' first arose abroad in a 1960s German film article written by Siegfried Kracauer about the film M ( 1931 ) , a German expressionist film about a pedophilic Serienm\u00f6rder .   Characteristics   General   Some commonly found characteristics of serial killers include the following :  * They may exhibit varying degrees of mental illness and/or psychopathy , which may contribute to their homicidal behavior . Unlike people with major mental disorders such as schizophrenia , psychopaths can seem normal and often quite charming , a state of adaptation that psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley called the `` mask of sanity '' .  * They were often abused\u2014emotionally , physically and/or sexually\u2014by a family member .", "question": "which serial killer hanged himself in wakefield prison in january 2004, four years after being found guilty of 15 murders?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "charles d. hirsch", "modAnswer": "harry kane", "delete sentence number": [" However , in his book Serial Killers : The Method and Madness of Monsters ( 2004 ) , criminal justice historian Peter Vronsky argues that while Ressler might have coined the term serial homicide within law , at Bramshill Police Academy in Britain , the terms serial murder and serial murderer appear in John Brophy 's book The Meaning of Murder ( 1966 ) .", " In his more recent study , Vronsky states that the term `` serial killing '' first entered into American popular usage when published in the New York Times in the spring of 1981 , to describe Atlanta serial killer Wayne Williams .", "  * * For example , someone who is mentally ill may have psychotic breaks that cause them to believe they are another person or are compelled to murder by other entities .", "  * * Psychopathic behavior that is consistent with traits common to some serial killers include sensation seeking , a lack of remorse or guilt , impulsivity , the need for control , and predatory behavior ."], "distance value": [[8, 0.5251196622848511], [0, 0.5220033526420593], [9, 0.5147687792778015], [7, 0.47340747714042664], [2, 0.45634233951568604], [1, 0.4446065425872803], [10, 0.4291309416294098], [13, 0.42038556933403015], [5, 0.4173436760902405], [14, 0.4007897973060608], [6, 0.35915321111679077], [3, 0.3417598605155945], [16, 0.32355302572250366], [4, 0.3232894539833069], [15, 0.2895292043685913], [12, 0.2142631560564041], [18, 0.18515998125076294], [17, 0.09893219918012619], [11, 0.08642151951789856]]}

Since the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions , he or she or it or they also needs/need to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary .

{"test case number": 712, "context": "Pall Mall is a street in the St James 's area of the City of Westminster , Central London . It connects St James 's Street to Trafalgar Square and is a section of the regional A4 road . The street 's name is derived from `` pall-mall '' , a ball game played there during the 17th century .   The area was built up during the reign of Charles II with fashionable London residences . It became known for high-class shopping in the 18th century , and gentlemen 's clubs in the 19th . The Reform , Athenaeum and Travellers Clubs have survived to the 21st century . The War Office was based on Pall Mall during the second half of the 19th century , and the Royal Automobile Club 's headquarters have been on the street since 1908 .   Geography   The street is around long and runs east in the St James 's area , from St James 's Street across Waterloo Place , to the Haymarket and continues as Pall Mall East towards Trafalgar Square . The street numbers run consecutively from north-side east to west and then continue on the south-side west to east . It is part of the A4 , a major road running west from Central London . London Bus Route 9 runs westwards along Pall Mall , connecting Trafalgar Square to Piccadilly and Hyde Park Corner .   History and topography   Early history and pall-mall field   Pall Mall was constructed in 1661 , replacing an earlier highway slightly to the south that ran from the Haymarket ( approximately where Warwick House Street is now ) to the royal residence , St James 's Palace . Historical research suggests a road had been in this location since Saxon times , although the earliest documentary references are from the 12th century in connection with a leper colony at St James 's Hospital . When St. James 's Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century , the park 's boundary wall was built along the south side of the road . In 1620 , the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality .   Pall-mall , a ball game similar to croquet , was introduced to England in the early-17th century by James I . The game , already popular in France and Scotland , was enjoyed by James ' sons Henry and Charles . In 1630 , St James 's Field , London 's first pall-mall court , was laid out to the north of the Haymarket \u2013 St James road .   After the Restoration and King Charles II 's return to London on 29 May 1660 , a pall-mall court was constructed in St James 's Park just south of the wall , on the site of The Mall . Samuel Pepys 's diary entry for 2 April 1661 records that he `` ... went into St. James 's Park , where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele , the first time that I ever saw the sport . '' This new court suffered from dust blown over the wall from coaches travelling along the highway . In July 1661 posts and rails were erected , stopping up the old road . The court for pall-mall was very long and narrow , and often known as an alley , so the old court provided a suitable route for relocating the eastern approach to St James 's Palace . A grant was made to Dan O'Neale , Groom of the Bedchamber , and John Denham , Surveyor of the King 's Works allocating a 1400 by area of land for this purpose . The grant was endorsed `` Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James 's . ''   A new road was built on the site of the old pall-mall court , and opened in September 1661 . It was named Catherine Street , after Catherine of Braganza , wife of Charles II , but was better known as Pall Mall Street or the Old Pall Mall . The pall-mall field was a popular place for recreation and Pepys records several other visits . By July 1665 Pepys used `` Pell Mell '' to refer to the street as well as the game .   17th- and 18th-century buildings   In 1662 , Pall Mall was one of several streets `` thought fitt immediately to be repaired , new paved or otherwise amended '' under the Streets , London and Westminster Act 1662 .

In 1620 , the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality .   Pall-mall , a ball game similar to croquet , was introduced to England in the early-17th century by James I . The game , already popular in France and Scotland , was enjoyed by James ' sons Henry and Charles . In 1630 , St James 's Field , London 's first pall-mall court , was laid out to the north of the Haymarket \u2013 St James road .   After the Restoration and King Charles II 's return to London on 29 May 1660 , a pall-mall court was constructed in St James 's Park just south of the wall , on the site of The Mall . Samuel Pepys 's diary entry for 2 April 1661 records that he `` . James 's Park , where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele , the first time that I ever saw the sport . In July 1661 posts and rails were erected , stopping up the old road . The court for pall-mall was very long and narrow , and often known as an alley , so the old court provided a suitable route for relocating the eastern approach to St James 's Palace . A grant was made to Dan O'Neale , Groom of the Bedchamber , and John Denham , Surveyor of the King 's Works allocating a 1400 by area of land for this purpose . The grant was endorsed `` Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James 's . ''   A new road was built on the site of the old pall-mall court , and opened in September 1661 . It was named Catherine Street , after Catherine of Braganza , wife of Charles II , but was better known as Pall Mall Street or the Old Pall Mall . The pall-mall field was a popular place for recreation and Pepys records several other visits . By July 1665 Pepys used `` Pell Mell '' to refer to the street as well as the game .   17th- and 18th-century buildings   In 1662 , Pall Mall was one of several streets `` thought fitt immediately to be repaired , new paved or otherwise amended '' under the Streets , London and Westminster Act 1662 .", "question": "what building in pall mall, commissioned by henry viii around 1532, is the administrative centre of the british monarchy?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "the palace", "modAnswer": "the war office", "delete sentence number": [" It became known for high-class shopping in the 18th century , and gentlemen 's clubs in the 19th .", " The Reform , Athenaeum and Travellers Clubs have survived to the 21st century .", " The street numbers run consecutively from north-side east to west and then continue on the south-side west to east .", " When St.", ".", ".", " went into St.", " '' This new court suffered from dust blown over the wall from coaches travelling along the highway ."], "distance value": [[19, 0.6770390272140503], [11, 0.6729212999343872], [0, 0.6554577946662903], [6, 0.6080166697502136], [3, 0.5980879068374634], [16, 0.5477257966995239], [18, 0.5408340692520142], [27, 0.519766092300415], [31, 0.5193070769309998], [34, 0.4982735812664032], [14, 0.47331860661506653], [30, 0.4722125828266144], [12, 0.45742717385292053], [15, 0.44298291206359863], [2, 0.43909916281700134], [32, 0.42073702812194824], [7, 0.4022853374481201], [10, 0.382103830575943], [9, 0.37036389112472534], [1, 0.35945066809654236], [17, 0.35781240463256836], [28, 0.34840691089630127], [24, 0.33615756034851074], [20, 0.3089217245578766], [26, 0.2783266603946686], [33, 0.2730778455734253], [29, 0.26760202646255493], [25, 0.22382710874080658], [5, 0.2210923731327057], [4, 0.21445274353027344], [23, 0.12711338698863983], [13, 0.08158458769321442], [21, 0.07446356862783432], [22, 0.07446356862783432], [8, 0.037643950432538986]]}

The local physician , Dr. Livesey , deduces that the map is of an island where a deceased pirate\u2014Captain Flint\u2014buried a vast treasure .

They are all former `` gentlemen o'fortune '' ( pirates ) in Flint 's crew and have planned a mutiny .

Its influence is enormous on popular perceptions of pirates , including such elements as treasure maps marked with an `` X '' , schooners , the Black Spot , tropical islands , and one-legged seamen bearing parrots on their shoulders.Cordingly , David ( 1995 ) Under the Black Flag : the romance and reality of life among the pirates ; p. 7   Plot summary   ; PART I\u2014 '' THE OLD BUCCANEER ''   An old sailor , calling himself `` the captain '' \u2014real name `` Billy '' Bones\u2014comes to lodge at the Admiral Benbow Inn on the west English coast during the mid-1700s , paying the innkeeper 's son , Jim Hawkins , a few pennies to keep a lookout for a one-legged `` seafaring man . After a visit from yet another man , Billy has another stroke and dies ; Jim and his mother ( his father has also died just a few days before ) unlock the sea chest , finding some money , a journal , and a map . The local physician , Dr.   ; PART II\u2014 '' THE SEA COOK ''   Several weeks later , Trelawney sends for Jim and Livesey and introduces them to `` Long John '' Silver , a one-legged Bristol tavern-keeper whom he has hired as ship 's cook . ( Silver enhances his outre attributes\u2014crutch , pirate argot , etc.\u2014with a talking parrot . ) They also meet Captain Smollett , who tells them that he dislikes most of the crew on the voyage , which it seems everyone in Bristol knows is a search for treasure . During the voyage the first mate , a drunkard , disappears overboard . And just before the island is sighted , Jim\u2014concealed in an apple barrel\u2014overhears Silver talking with two other crewmen . They are all former `` gentlemen o'fortune '' ( pirates ) in Flint 's crew and have planned a mutiny . Jim alerts the captain , doctor , and squire , and they calculate that they will be seven to 19 against the mutineers and must pretend not to suspect anything until the treasure is found , when they can surprise their adversaries .   ; PART III\u2014 '' MY SHORE ADVENTURE ''   But after the ship is anchored , Silver and some of the others go ashore , and two men who refuse to join the mutiny are killed\u2014one with so loud a scream that everyone realizes there can be no more pretense . Jim has impulsively joined the shore party and covertly witnessed Silver committing one of the murders ; now , in fleeing , he encounters a half-crazed Englishman , Ben Gunn , who tells him he was marooned here and can help against the mutineers in return for passage home and part of the treasure .   ; PART IV\u2014 '' THE STOCKADE ''   Meanwhile , Smollett , Trelawney , and Livesey , along with Trelawney 's three servants and one of the other hands , Abraham Gray , abandon the ship and come ashore to occupy an old abandoned stockade .

Typically , it is shown on BBC One on Saturday evenings during the English football season , showing highlights of the day 's matches in English football 's top division , the Premier League . It is one of the BBC 's longest-running shows , having been on air since 22 August 1964 , though it has not always been aired regularly . Match of the Day has been recognised by Guinness World Records as the longest-running football TV programme in the world . The programme is broadcast from MediaCityUK in Salford Quays on the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal in Greater Manchester .   Since 1999 MOTD has been presented by the former England captain Gary Lineker . Lineker is usually joined by two pundits to analyse and review the day 's action . Former Newcastle United captain Alan Shearer is the lead pundit . Over the years many famous former footballers such as Mark Lawrenson and Alan Hansen , and respected sports broadcasters , such as Kenneth Wolstenholme , David Coleman , Barry Davies , John Motson , Jimmy Hill , Des Lynam , and Ruud Gullit have fine-tuned their skills on the programme .   History   1960s   Although the title was first used by the BBC for its Wimbledon tennis highlights programme in June 1964 , the first football-related edition of Match of the Day was screened on BBC2 on 22 August 1964 , and showed highlights of a game between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield . The programme 's audience was estimated at only 20,000 , less than half of the attendance at the ground .   Match of the Day was not universally welcomed in the football world ; in 1965 several clubs attempted to block a renewed deal with the BBC in fear of a drop in gate attendances at matches . Eventually a compromise was reached where the BBC agreed not to reveal which match was to be shown until after the day 's play had concluded . The first colour edition of Match of the Day on BBC1 was shown on 15 November 1969 , between Liverpool and West Ham United however first colour edition was a game shown on 2 November 1968 on BBC2 between Chelsea and Manchester City .   1970s and 1980s   Slow motion replays were first introduced in 1969 . However , at the end of the decade the BBC lost a significant share of matches , with a new four-year deal in 1979 splitting the rights between the BBC and ITV ( ITV had originally won exclusive rights , but a ruling from the Office of Fair Trading ordered that the rights be split ) . Match of the Day was moved to Sunday afternoons for the 1980\u201381 and 1982\u201383 seasons .   In 1983 , the programme reverted to being shown on Saturday night , although that year four broadcasts were lost due to industrial action .

{"test case number": 784, "context": "World War I ( WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War , or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . More than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history . Over 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians died as a result of the war ( including the victims of a number of genocides ) , a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents ' technological and industrial sophistication , and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare . It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history , and paved the way for major political changes , including revolutions in many of the nations involved .   The war drew in all the world 's economic great powers , assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the British Empire , France and the Russian Empire ) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary . Although Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary , it did not join the Central Powers , as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive , against the terms of the alliance . These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , while the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers .   The trigger for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 . This set off a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia , and entangled international alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked . Within weeks , the major powers were at war and the conflict soon spread around the world .   On 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia . As Russia mobilised in support of Serbia , Germany invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg before moving towards France , leading the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany . After the German march on Paris was halted , what became known as the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition , with a trench line that changed little until 1917 . On the Eastern Front , the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians , but the Germans stopped its invasion of East Prussia . In November 1914 , the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers , opening fronts in the Caucasus , Mesopotamia and the Sinai . In 1915 , Italy joined the Allies and Bulgaria joined the Central Power ; Romania joined the Allies in 1916 , as did the United States in 1917 .   The Russian government collapsed in March 1917 , and a revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers via the Treaty of Brest Litovsk , which was a massive German victory . After a stunning German offensive along the Western Front in the spring of 1918 , the Allies rallied and drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives . On 4 November 1918 , the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to an armistice , and Germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918 , ending the war in victory for the Allies .   By the end of the war , the German Empire , Russian Empire , Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist . National borders were redrawn , with several independent nations restored or created , and Germany 's colonies were parceled out among the winners . During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 , the Big Four ( Britain , France , the United States and Italy ) imposed their terms in a series of treaties . The League of Nations was formed with the aim of preventing any repetition of such a conflict . This effort failed , and economic depression , renewed European nationalism , weakened member states , and the German feeling of humiliation contributed to the rise of Nazism .

Following what he referred to as a religious epiphany , Foreman became an ordained Christian minister . Ten years later , he announced a comeback and , in November 1994 , at age 45 , he regained a portion of the heavyweight championship by knocking out 27-year-old Michael Moorer to win the WBA and IBF titles . Foreman remains the oldest heavyweight champion in history , and the second oldest in any weight class after Bernard Hopkins .   Foreman has been inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame and the International Boxing Hall of Fame . The International Boxing Research Organization ( IBRO ) rates Foreman as the eighth greatest heavyweight of all time . In 2002 , he was named one of the 25 greatest fighters of the past 80 years by The Ring magazine . The Ring ranked him as the ninth greatest puncher of all time . He was a ringside analyst for HBO 's boxing coverage for twelve years , leaving in 2004 . Outside of boxing , he is a successful entrepreneur and is known for his promotion of the George Foreman Grill , which has sold over 100 million units worldwide .   Early life   George Foreman was born in Marshall , Texas . Foreman , whom his mother had married when George was a small child , his biological father was Leroy Moorehead . Foreman was interested in football and idolized Jim Brown , but gave it up for boxing . He won a gold medal in the boxing/heavyweight division at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games . After moving to Pleasanton , California , with the help of a supervisor he began to train in boxing .   Professional career   Foreman had an amateur record of 22\u20134 , losing twice to Clay Hodges ( also defeated by Max Briggs in his first ever fight ) . Foreman turned professional in 1969 with a three-round knockout of Donald Walheim in New York . He had a total of 13 fights that year , winning all of them ( 11 by knockout ) .   In 1970 , Foreman continued his march toward the undisputed heavyweight title , winning all 12 of his bouts ( 11 by knockout ) . Among the opponents he defeated were Gregorio Peralta , whom he decisioned at Madison Square Garden although Peralta showed that Foreman was vulnerable to fast counter punching mixed with an assertive boxing style . Foreman then defeated George Chuvalo by technical knockout ( TKO ) in three rounds . After this win , Foreman defeated Charlie Polite in four rounds and Boone Kirkman in three .   In 1971 , Foreman won seven more fights , winning all of them by knockout , including a rematch with Peralta , whom he defeated by knockout in the tenth and final round in Oakland , California , and a win over Leroy Caldwell , who was knocked out in the second round . After amassing a record of 32\u20130 ( 29 KO ) , he was ranked as the number one challenger by the WBA and WBC .

{"test case number": 826, "context": "William Shakespeare ( ; 26 April 1564 ( baptised ) \u2013 23 April 1616 ) was an English : poet , : playwright , and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's pre-eminent dramatist . ; ; . He is often called England 's national poet , and the `` Bard of Avon '' . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 38 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright .   Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna , and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 , at age 49 , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive , which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , sexuality , and religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others .   Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613 . His early plays were primarily comedies and histories , and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres . He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608 , including Hamlet , Othello , King Lear , and Macbeth , considered some of the finest works in the English language . In his last phase , he wrote tragicomedies , also known as romances , and collaborated with other playwrights .   Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime . In 1623 , however , John Heminges and Henry Condell , two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare , published a more definitive text known as the First Folio , a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare 's . It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson , in which Shakespeare is hailed , presciently , as `` not of an age , but for all time '' .The Norton Anthology of English Literature : Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century , Volume B , 2012 , pg . 1168   In the 20th and 21st centuries , his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance . His plays remain highly popular , and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world .   Life   Early life   William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare , an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield , and Mary Arden , the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer . He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564 . His actual date of birth remains unknown , but is traditionally observed on 23 April , Saint George 's Day . This date , which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar 's mistake , has proved appealing to biographers , because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 . He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son .   Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered in 1553 , about a quarter-mile ( 400 m ) from his home . Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era , but grammar school curricula were largely similar : the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors .   At the age of 18 , Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway . The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582 . The next day , two of Hathaway 's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage . The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste , since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of", "modContext": "William Shakespeare ( ; ; ; .

Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime . In 1623 , however , John Heminges and Henry Condell , two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare , published a more definitive text known as the First Folio , a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare 's . It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson , in which Shakespeare is hailed , presciently , as `` not of an age , but for all time '' .The Norton Anthology of English Literature : Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century , Volume B , 2012 , pg .   Life   Early life   William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare , an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield , and Mary Arden , the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer . He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564 . His actual date of birth remains unknown , but is traditionally observed on 23 April , Saint George 's Day . This date , which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar 's mistake , has proved appealing to biographers , because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 . He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son .   At the age of 18 , Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway . The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582 . The next day , two of Hathaway 's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage .", "question": "\"what was the name of the jester in shakespeare's \"\"as you like it\"\"?\"", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "Judith", "modAnswer": "; ;", "delete sentence number": [" 26 April 1564 ( baptised ) \u2013 23 April 1616 ) was an English : poet , : playwright , and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's pre-eminent dramatist .", " His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 38 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship .", "   Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire .", " 1168   In the 20th and 21st centuries , his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance .", " His plays remain highly popular , and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world .", "   Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered in 1553 , about a quarter-mile ( 400 m ) from his home .", " Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era , but grammar school curricula were largely similar : the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors ."], "distance value": [[10, 0.5219851732254028], [12, 0.45375126600265503], [5, 0.44317126274108887], [0, 0.43975216150283813], [23, 0.4092368483543396], [11, 0.40045231580734253], [20, 0.39854446053504944], [4, 0.3789236545562744], [9, 0.3756237030029297], [15, 0.3632184863090515], [25, 0.3484039902687073], [16, 0.3477422893047333], [27, 0.34005439281463623], [26, 0.3374176621437073], [17, 0.30574169754981995], [13, 0.30040228366851807], [19, 0.2819615304470062], [2, 0.2793169319629669], [24, 0.2780524492263794], [14, 0.2603265047073364], [18, 0.24987226724624634], [7, 0.2451498806476593], [3, 0.24065710604190826], [1, 0.23682264983654022], [21, 0.19033649563789368], [6, 0.14160916209220886], [22, 0.12667131423950195], [8, 0.11286337673664093], [28, 0.10719648003578186], [29, -0.017595216631889343]]}

It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece . Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization , and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself .   Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives , and implicitly in Greek representational arts , such as vase-paintings and votive gifts . Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world , and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods , goddesses , heroes , heroines and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature .  The oldest known Greek literary sources , Homer 's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias .   Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology , with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes .   Sources   Greek mythology is known today primarily from Greek literature and representations on visual media dating from the Geometric period from c. 900\u2013800 BC onward . In fact , literary and archaeological sources integrate , sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict ; however , in many cases , the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots .   Literary sources   Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature . Nevertheless , the only general mythographical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity was the Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus . This work attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets and provides a grand summary of traditional Greek mythology and heroic legends . Apollodorus of Athens lived from c. 180\u2013125 BC and wrote on many of these topics . His writings may have formed the basis for the collection ; however the `` Library '' discusses events that occurred long after his death , hence the name Pseudo-Apollodorus .   Among the earliest literary sources are Homer 's two epic poems , the Iliad and the Odyssey . Other poets completed the `` epic cycle '' , but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely . Despite their traditional name , the `` Homeric Hymns '' have no direct connection with Homer . They are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so-called Lyric age . Hesiod , a possible contemporary with Homer , offers in his Theogony ( Origin of the Gods ) the fullest account of the earliest Greek myths , dealing with the creation of the world ; the origin of the gods , Titans , and Giants ; as well as elaborate genealogies , folktales , and etiological myths .

Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world , and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods , goddesses , heroes , heroines and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature .  The oldest known Greek literary sources , Homer 's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes . 900\u2013800 BC onward . In fact , literary and archaeological sources integrate , sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict ; however , in many cases , the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots .   Literary sources   Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature . Nevertheless , the only general mythographical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity was the Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus . 180\u2013125 BC and wrote on many of these topics . Other poets completed the `` epic cycle '' , but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely . Despite their traditional name , the `` Homeric Hymns '' have no direct connection with Homer . They are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so-called Lyric age . Hesiod , a possible contemporary with Homer , offers in his Theogony ( Origin of the Gods ) the fullest account of the earliest Greek myths , dealing with the creation of the world ; the origin of the gods , Titans , and Giants ; as well as elaborate genealogies , folktales , and etiological myths . Hesiod 's Works and Days , a didactic poem about farming life , also includes the myths of Prometheus , Pandora , and the Five Ages .", "question": "referring to the cause of a person's downfall, who is the greek goddess of punishment?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "sybil", "modAnswer": "Pandora", "delete sentence number": ["   Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology , with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts .", "   Sources   Greek mythology is known today primarily from Greek literature and representations on visual media dating from the Geometric period from c.", " This work attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets and provides a grand summary of traditional Greek mythology and heroic legends .", " Apollodorus of Athens lived from c.", " His writings may have formed the basis for the collection ;", " however the `` Library '' discusses events that occurred long after his death , hence the name Pseudo-Apollodorus .", "   Among the earliest literary sources are Homer 's two epic poems , the Iliad and the Odyssey ."], "distance value": [[0, 0.5702210664749146], [19, 0.5656012296676636], [4, 0.5626435875892639], [5, 0.5005588531494141], [17, 0.48526477813720703], [6, 0.4833143651485443], [1, 0.46046918630599976], [2, 0.45214343070983887], [3, 0.45136570930480957], [9, 0.4448714852333069], [13, 0.4315214157104492], [8, 0.4250490069389343], [12, 0.41518163681030273], [7, 0.40135490894317627], [11, 0.3864585757255554], [27, 0.3758103549480438], [14, 0.32679352164268494], [23, 0.3237711787223816], [16, 0.3231421113014221], [18, 0.30861082673072815], [20, 0.3034842908382416], [28, 0.2744605839252472], [24, 0.2588460445404053], [10, 0.225300595164299], [25, 0.18695101141929626], [22, 0.16866090893745422], [26, 0.14280232787132263], [21, 0.11971259117126465], [15, -0.07643938064575195]]}

The tradition tells that Byzas , son of King Nisos ( \u039d\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 ) , planned to found a colony of the Dorian Greek city of Megara . Byzas consulted the oracle of Apollo at Delphi , which instructed Byzas to settle opposite the `` Land of the Blind '' . Leading a group of Megarian colonists , Byzas found a location where the Golden Horn , a great natural harbour , meets the Bosphorus and flows into the Sea of Marmara , opposite Chalcedon ( modern day Kad\u0131k\u00f6y ) .

{"test case number": 852, "context": "The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th century\u2014when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms\u2014until 1707 , when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain .   In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms , united by \u00c6thelstan ( r. 927\u2013939 ) , became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre .   Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066\u20131154 , Plantagenet 1154\u20131485 , Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649\u20131660 ) .  Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became `` more English in nature '' ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor .   The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327\u20131377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558\u20131603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World .   From the accession of James I in 1603 , the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland . Under the Stuarts , the kingdom plunged into civil war , which culminated in the execution of Charles I in 1649 .

In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms , united by \u00c6thelstan ( r. The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre .   Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066\u20131154 , Plantagenet 1154\u20131485 , Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649\u20131660 ) .  Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became `` more English in nature '' ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor .   The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327\u20131377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558\u20131603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World .   From the accession of James I in 1603 , the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland .

{"test case number": 872, "context": "Mission : Impossible is an American television series that was created and initially produced by Bruce Geller . It chronicles the missions of a team of secret government agents known as the Impossible Missions Force ( IMF ) . In the first season , the team is led by Dan Briggs , played by Steven Hill ; Jim Phelps , played by Peter Graves , takes charge for the remaining seasons . A hallmark of the series shows Briggs or Phelps receiving his instructions on a recording that then self-destructs , followed by the theme music composed by Lalo Schifrin .   The series was filmed and financed by Desilu Productions , and aired on the CBS network from September 1966 to March 1973 . The series was reprised in 1988 for two seasons on ABC , retaining only Graves in the cast . It also inspired a series of theatrical motion pictures starring Tom Cruise , beginning in 1996 .   Series overview   The series follows the exploits of the Impossible Missions Force ( IMF ) , a small team of secret agents used for covert missions against dictators , evil organizations and ( primarily in later episodes ) crime lords . On occasion , the IMF also mounts unsanctioned , private missions on behalf of its members .   The identities of the higher echelons of the organization that oversees the IMF are never revealed .

{"test case number": 898, "context": "Ten-pin bowling is a sport in which a `` bowler '' rolls a bowling ball down a wood-structure or synthetic ( polyurethane ) lane and towards ten pins positioned at the end of the lane . The objective is to score points by knocking down as many pins as possible . Three finger holes are drilled into a traditional bowling ball , and weights vary considerably to make the sport playable for all ages . The pins are arranged in a triangular position by an automated machine . While professional ten-pin bowling tournaments are held in numerous countries , the sport is commonly played as a hobby by millions of people around the world .   In Canada , the United States , United Kingdom and Australia , the game is commonly referred to as just `` Bowling '' . In New England , `` bowling '' is usually referred to as `` ten-pin bowling '' or `` big-ball bowling '' , because of the smaller diameter , lighter weight ball used in the Worcester , Massachusetts-conceived sport of candlepin bowling from 1880 , and the similarly `` small-ball '' sport of duckpin bowling ( conceived in 1895 ) , popular in the Northeast United States , as well as Canada 's own sport of five-pin bowling , all three of which use smaller diameter , lighter weight bowling balls when compared to tenpin bowling , without the necessity for finger holes in them .   Summary   The , 60 ft lane is bordered along its length by semicylindrical channels called `` gutters '' , which are designed to collect errant balls . The overall width of the lane including the channels is . The narrow lane prevents bowling a straight line at the angle required to consistently carry ( knock down ) all ten pins for a strike . Most skillful bowlers will roll a side spinning ( hook shape reaction ) ball to overcome this . A foul line is marked at the end of the lane nearest to the bowler : if any part of a bowler 's body touches the line itself or beyond ( anywhere on the actual lane surface or any adjoining areas including walls and other lanes ) after the ball is delivered , the bowl is a foul and any pins knocked over by that delivery are scored as zero ( 0 ) . The bowler is allowed one shot at a new rack of ten pins if s/he fouled on the first roll of a frame , and if all ten pins are knocked down on this shot , it is scored as a spare . Behind the foul line is an `` approach '' approximately 15 ft long used to gain speed and leverage on the ball before delivering it . 60 ft from the foul line , where the lane terminates , it is joined to a roughly 36 in deep by wide surface of durable and impact-resistant material called the `` pin deck '' , upon which each rack of pins is set .

Bowling has a unique scoring system which keeps track not only of the current pinfall in a frame , but also strikes and spares which allow for the value of subsequent pinfall . Effectively , there are three kinds of marks given in a score ; a strike ( all ten down in the first ball ) , a spare ( all ten down by the second ball ) , and an open ( one or more missed pins still standing after the second ball ) . A strike earns ten points plus the points for the next two balls thrown . ( For example , if a player got a strike then followed with a 7 then 2 , their value for the strike frame would be 10+7+2 , or 19 . ) A spare earns ten points plus the points for the next ball thrown .

The objective is to score points by knocking down as many pins as possible . Three finger holes are drilled into a traditional bowling ball , and weights vary considerably to make the sport playable for all ages . While professional ten-pin bowling tournaments are held in numerous countries , the sport is commonly played as a hobby by millions of people around the world .   In Canada , the United States , United Kingdom and Australia , the game is commonly referred to as just `` Bowling '' . In New England , `` bowling '' is usually referred to as `` ten-pin bowling '' or `` big-ball bowling '' , because of the smaller diameter , lighter weight ball used in the Worcester , Massachusetts-conceived sport of candlepin bowling from 1880 , and the similarly `` small-ball '' sport of duckpin bowling ( conceived in 1895 ) , popular in the Northeast United States , as well as Canada 's own sport of five-pin bowling , all three of which use smaller diameter , lighter weight bowling balls when compared to tenpin bowling , without the necessity for finger holes in them . The narrow lane prevents bowling a straight line at the angle required to consistently carry ( knock down ) all ten pins for a strike . Most skillful bowlers will roll a side spinning ( hook shape reaction ) ball to overcome this . A foul line is marked at the end of the lane nearest to the bowler : if any part of a bowler 's body touches the line itself or beyond ( anywhere on the actual lane surface or any adjoining areas including walls and other lanes ) after the ball is delivered , the bowl is a foul and any pins knocked over by that delivery are scored as zero ( 0 ) .

The first category of acids is the proton donors or Br\\u00f8nsted acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Br\\u00f8nsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Br\\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ .   Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/ac\\u0113re meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as \'acid \' ( as in \'dissolved in acid \' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic .   Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . As these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial sense ) can be solutions or pure substances , and can be derived from acids ( in the strict sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid .   The second category of acids are Lewis acids , which form a covalent bond with an electron pair . An example is boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( NH3 ) . Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Br\\u00f8nsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( H+ ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs . However , hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids can not form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids . Conversely , many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids . In modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a Br\\u00f8nsted acid and not a Lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid .   Definitions and concepts   Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids .   Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions , or can be dissolved in water , so the Arrhenius and Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant .   The Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton ( H+ ) from an acid to a base .   Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions . Interestingly , although alcohols and amines can be Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids , they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms .   Arrhenius acids   The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions ( H+ ) or protons in 1884 . An Arrhenius acid is a substance that , when added to water , increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water . Note that chemists often write H+ ( aq ) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus , a proton , does not exist alone in water , it exists as the hydronium ion , H3O+ . Thus , an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium", "modContext": "An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron ( proton or hydrogen ion H+ ) , or , alternatively , capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair ( a Lewis acid ) .   The first category of acids is the proton donors or Br\\u00f8nsted acids . Br\\u00f8nsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Br\\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ .   Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/ac\\u0113re meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as \'acid \' ( as in \'dissolved in acid \' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution .   Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid . An example is boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( NH3 ) . Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Br\\u00f8nsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( H+ ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs . However , hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids can not form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids . Conversely , many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids . In modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a Br\\u00f8nsted acid and not a Lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid .

In North America , Native Americans deemed the weasel to be a bad sign ; crossing its path meant a `` speedy death \'\' . In English-speaking areas , weasel can be a disparaging term , noun or verb , for someone regarded as sneaky , conniving or untrustworthy . According to the encyclopedia Wakan Sansai Zue from the Edo period , a nate of weasels would cause conflagrations , and the cry of a weasel was considered a harbinger of misfortune . In the Niigata Prefecture , the sound of a nate of weasels making a rustle resembled six people hulling rice , so was called the `` \'\' , and it was an omen for one \'s home to decline or flourish .

Early life and education   Lean was born in Croydon , Surrey ( now part of Greater London ) , to Francis William le Blount Lean and the former Helena Tangye ( niece of Sir Richard Trevithick Tangye ) . His parents were Quakers and he was a pupil at the Quaker-founded Leighton Park School in Reading . His younger brother , Edward Tangye Lean ( 1911\\u20131974 ) , founded the original Inklings literary club when a student at Oxford University . Lean was a half-hearted schoolboy with a dreamy nature who was labeled a `` dud \'\' of a student ; he left in his mid-teens and entered his father \'s chartered accountancy firm as an apprentice . A more formative event for his career than his formal education was an uncle \'s gift , when Lean was aged ten , of a Brownie box camera . `` You usually did n\'t give a boy a camera until he was 16 or 17 in those days .

Early fixed images   The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nic\\u00e9phore Ni\\u00e9pce ,   using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride , which darkened where it was exposed to light . No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Ni\\u00e9pce , so the photograph was not permanent , eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it . In the mid-1820s , Ni\\u00e9pce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea . The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image . The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away . One of those photographs has survived .   Daguerreotypes and calotypes   After Ni\\u00e9pce \'s death in 1833 , his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process , which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839 . Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide . After exposure in the camera , the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt ( sodium chloride ) . Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process , the calotype , in 1840 . As commercialized , both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes . The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus .

Since then industrialisation has spread throughout the world . The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians , as is the pace of economic and social changes . GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy , while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies . Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants .   The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870 , when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport ( steam-powered railways , boats and ships ) , the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories .   Etymology   The earliest recorded use of the term `` Industrial Revolution \'\' seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto , announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise . In his 1976 book Keywords : A Vocabulary of Culture and Society , Raymond Williams states in the entry for `` Industry \'\' : `` The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen , between 1811 and 1818 , and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the [ 19th ] century . \'\' The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s , as in J\\u00e9r\\u00f4me-Adolphe Blanqui \'s description in 1837 of la r\\u00e9volution industrielle . Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of `` an industrial revolution , a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society \'\' . However , although Engels wrote in the 1840s , his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s , and his expression did not enter everyday language until then . Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee , whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term .   Some historians , such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts , have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer . This is still a subject of debate among historians .   Important technological developments   The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations , beginning in the second half of the 18th century . By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies :  * Textiles \\u2013 Mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water greatly increased the output of a worker .

Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants .   The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870 , when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport ( steam-powered railways , boats and ships ) , the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories .   Etymology   The earliest recorded use of the term `` Industrial Revolution \'\' seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto , announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise . In his 1976 book Keywords : A Vocabulary of Culture and Society , Raymond Williams states in the entry for `` Industry \'\' : `` The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen , between 1811 and 1818 , and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the [ 19th ] century . Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of `` an industrial revolution , a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society \'\' . However , although Engels wrote in the 1840s , his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s , and his expression did not enter everyday language until then .   Some historians , such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts , have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer . This is still a subject of debate among historians .   Important technological developments   The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations , beginning in the second half of the 18th century . By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies :  * Textiles \\u2013 Mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water greatly increased the output of a worker . The power loom increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40 .", "question": "name the leicester-born eponymous inspiration of the early 19th textile machinery smashers of the english industrial revolution, whose collective name is now a term for someone resisting new technology?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "a textile machinery smasher", "modAnswer": "edmund tilney", "delete sentence number": ["   The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history ;", " almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way .", " Since then industrialisation has spread throughout the world .", " The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians , as is the pace of economic and social changes .", " \'\' The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s , as in J\\u00e9r\\u00f4me-Adolphe Blanqui \'s description in 1837 of la r\\u00e9volution industrielle .", " Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee , whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term ."], "distance value": [[24, 0.5367915630340576], [2, 0.5262174010276794], [17, 0.5171935558319092], [3, 0.4982583820819855], [1, 0.49163326621055603], [14, 0.4769943356513977], [23, 0.4764779210090637], [8, 0.4742218852043152], [0, 0.4482230246067047], [15, 0.42291632294654846], [4, 0.41826772689819336], [18, 0.4078238904476166], [16, 0.3998556137084961], [21, 0.3849547505378723], [10, 0.3822552561759949], [9, 0.3703952431678772], [7, 0.3622075021266937], [20, 0.3503498435020447], [11, 0.33013916015625], [25, 0.3122046887874603], [13, 0.28812021017074585], [6, 0.26347482204437256], [22, 0.16867414116859436], [19, 0.16574300825595856], [12, 0.1590253859758377], [5, 0.1005512923002243]]}\n', '{"test case number": 213, "context": "Marlon Brando , Jr. ( April 3 , 1924 \\u2013 July 1 , 2004 ) was an American actor , film director , and activist .

Etymology   The English words `` Wales \'\' and `` Welsh \'\' derive from the same Germanic root ( singular Walh , plural Walha ) , which was itself derived from the name of the Celtic tribe known to the Romans as Volcae and which came to refer indiscriminately to all Celts and , later , to all inhabitants of the Roman Empire . The Old English-speaking Anglo-Saxons came to use the term W\\u00e6lisc when referring to the Celtic Britons in particular , and W\\u0113alas when referring to their lands . The modern names for some Continental European lands ( e.g . Wallonia and Wallachia ) and peoples ( e.g . the Vlachs via a borrowing into Old Church Slavonic ) have a similar etymology .   Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that the Anglo-Saxons associated with the Britons , including other non-Germanic territories in Britain ( e.g . Cornwall ) and Germanic territories particularly associated with Celtic Britons ( e.g . Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ) , as well as items associated with non-Germanic Europeans , such as the walnut .

It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations .

The show premiered on NBC on October 11 , 1975 , under the original title NBC \'s Saturday Night . The show \'s comedy sketches , which parody contemporary culture and politics , are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members . Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest ( who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast ) and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it \'s Saturday Night ! `` , properly beginning the show .   In 1980 Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities . He was replaced by Jean Doumanian , who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews . Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera . Others associated with the show , such as writers , have gone on to successful careers creating , writing , or starring in TV and film .   Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC \'s headquarters in the Comcast Building , SNL has aired 808 episodes since its debut , and concluded its forty-first season on May 21 , 2016 , making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States . The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries , including Canada , Spain , Italy , South Korea , Japan , Brazil , and Finland , each meeting with different levels of success . Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers ( 1980 ) and Wayne \'s World ( 1992 ) . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of \'\' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show .   Throughout four decades on air , Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards , including 42 Primetime Emmy Awards , two Peabody Awards , and three Writers Guild of America Awards . In 2000 , it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame . It was ranked tenth in TV Guide `` 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time \'\' list , and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine \'s `` 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME \'\' .

In 1974 Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weeknights , allowing him to take time off .   In 1974 NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming , Dick Ebersol , and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot . At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller , Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels . Over the next three weeks , Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter \'s idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches , political satire , and music performances . By 1975 Michaels had assembled a talented cast , including Dan Aykroyd , John Belushi , Chevy Chase , Jane Curtin , Garrett Morris , Laraine Newman , Michael O\'Donoghue , Gilda Radner , and George Coe . The show was originally called NBC \'s Saturday Night , because Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC . NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26 , 1977", "modContext": "Saturday Night Live ( abbreviated as SNL ) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol . The show premiered on NBC on October 11 , 1975 , under the original title NBC \'s Saturday Night . The show \'s comedy sketches , which parody contemporary culture and politics , are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members . Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest ( who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast ) and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it \'s Saturday Night ! Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera .   Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC \'s headquarters in the Comcast Building , SNL has aired 808 episodes since its debut , and concluded its forty-first season on May 21 , 2016 , making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States . The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries , including Canada , Spain , Italy , South Korea , Japan , Brazil , and Finland , each meeting with different levels of success . Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers ( 1980 ) and Wayne \'s World ( 1992 ) . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of \'\' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show .

History   The Big Breakfast was launched at the end of September 1992 to replace The Channel Four Daily , which was Channel 4 \'s unsuccessful first dip into the breakfast television market between 1989 and 1992 . The Daily , launched at huge expense , had possessed an analytical style , focusing largely on current affairs , news bulletins and cerebral quiz shows ; however , this format had failed to earn enough viewing figures , and consequently Channel 4 opted to change direction and work towards a lighter style concentrating mainly on entertainment and humour .   The first two presenters were Chris Evans ( from 1992 to 1994 ) and Gaby Roslin ( 1992 to 1996 ) . At its height in 1993 , viewing figures reached around two million per edition , and it was the highest rated UK breakfast television programme . Along with Evans and Roslin , Bob Geldof presented a short-lived political interview slot . His wife Paula Yates became notorious with her interviews conducted lying on a bed , and the puppet characters Zig and Zag created morning mayhem in the bathroom with Evans in a slot called \'The Crunch \' .   As part of his contract with The Big Breakfast , Evans was committed to developing a new show for Channel 4 . Do n\'t Forget Your Toothbrush began in early 1994 , and Evans cut his involvement with The Big Breakfast to three days a week , Tuesday to Thursday . Former Neighbours star Mark Little replaced Evans on Mondays and Fridays . When Evans left the show later that year , Little continued on Thursdays and Fridays while Paul Ross took over Mondays to Wednesdays . Richard Orford replaced Ross around Easter 1995 but was quickly dropped and exchanged with Down Your Doorstep presenter Keith Chegwin . In July 1995 , the show reverted to using just one male presenter throughout the week , Mark Little . Chegwin would cover for Little when he was on tour as a comedian or on holiday .   Relaunch   Roslin continued full-time until she made way for Zo\\u00eb Ball in 1996 . Audience figures slipped a little after Evans left , and a little more after Roslin stopped appearing . Mark Little left the programme in July 1996 , following press reports that he and Zo\\u00eb Ball had fallen out . Little was replaced by Keith Chegwin , who himself exited the programme in August 1996 , just ahead of a massive relaunch . In an attempt to stem the sliding viewing figures , the Big Breakfast house was refurbished at a cost of \\u00a32 million . New presenters Rick Adams and Sharron Davies were brought in but viewing figures fell dramatically . Davies left the programme in early 1997 , to be replaced by Denise van Outen . Van Outen had initially been brought in as part of the September 1996 relaunch as a traffic and travel presenter , before being given a role based at the house as the phone room presenter and holiday relief for Davies . In June 1997 , Johnny Vaughan covered for Adams for a fortnight alongside Van Outen , the pair forging a successful on screen partnership . Adams left the programme shortly afterwards and , in September 1997 , the Vaughan and Van Outen partnership was made permanent . Audience figures stabilised and the duo fronted the programme together until Van Outen \'s departure on January 1 , 1999 . ( A New Year \'s Day pre-record ) .

Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire \'s Greek East and Latin West divided . Constantine I ( r. 324\\u2013337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital , and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379\\u2013395 ) , Christianity became the Empire \'s official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . Finally , under the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610\\u2013641 ) , the Empire \'s military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin . Thus , although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture , and characterised by Orthodox Christianity .   The borders of the Empire evolved significantly over its existence , as it went through several cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527\\u2013565 ) , the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy , and Rome itself , which it held for two more centuries . During the reign of Maurice ( r. 582\\u2013602 ) , the Empire \'s eastern frontier was expanded and the north stabilised . However , his assassination caused the Byzantine\\u2013Sasanian War of 602\\u2013628 , which exhausted the Empire \'s resources and contributed to major territorial losses during the Muslim conquests of the seventh century . In a matter of years the Empire lost its richest provinces , Egypt and Syria , to the Arabs .   During the Macedonian dynasty ( 10th\\u201311th centuries ) , the Empire again expanded and experienced the two-century long Macedonian Renaissance , which came to an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . This battle opened the way for the Turks to settle in Anatolia as a homeland .   The Empire recovered again during the Komnenian restoration , such that by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city . However , it was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade , when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 and the territories that the Empire formerly governed were divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms . Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261 , the Byzantine Empire remained only one of several small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence . Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century . The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 finally ended the Byzantine Empire .

East and west are at right angles to north and south , with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east . Intermediate points between the four cardinal directions form the points of the compass . The intermediate ( intercardinal , or ordinal ) directions are northeast ( NE ) , southeast ( SE ) , southwest ( SW ) , and northwest ( NW ) . Further , the intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction , the eight shortest points in the compass rose to the right , i.e . NNE , ENE , ESE , and so on .   Locating the directions   Direction versus bearing   To keep to a bearing is not , in general , the same as going in a straight direction along a great circle . Conversely , one can keep to a great circle and the bearing may change . Thus the bearing of a straight path crossing the North Pole changes abruptly at the Pole from North to South . When travelling East or West , it is only on the Equator that one can keep East or West and be going straight ( without need to steer ) . Anywhere else , maintaining latitude requires a change in direction , requires steering . However , this change in direction becomes increasingly negligible as one moves to lower latitudes .   Magnetic compass   The Earth has a magnetic field which is approximately aligned with its axis of rotation . A magnetic compass is a device that uses this field to determine the cardinal directions . Magnetic compasses are extremely widely used , but only moderately accurate .   The Sun   The position of the Sun in the sky can be used for orientation if the general time of day is known . In the morning , the Sun rises roughly in the east ( due east only on the equinoxes ) and tracks upwards . In the evening it sets in the west , again roughly and only due west exactly on the equinoxes . In the middle of the day it is to the south for viewers in the Northern Hemisphere , who live north of the Tropic of Cancer , and the north for those in the Southern Hemisphere , who live south of the Tropic of Capricorn . This method works less well closer to the equator ( i.e . between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn ) since , in the northern hemisphere , the sun may be directly overhead or even to the north in summer . Conversely , at low latitudes in the southern hemisphere the sun may be to the south of the observer in summer . In these locations , one needs first to determine whether the sun is moving from east to west through north or south by watching its movements\\u2014left to right means it is going through south while right to left means it is going through north ; or one can watch the sun \'s shadows . If they move clockwise , the sun will be in the south at midday , and if they move anticlockwise , then the sun will be in the north at midday .   Due to the Earth \'s axial tilt , no matter what the location of the viewer , there are only two days each year when the sun rises precisely due east . These days are the equinoxes . On all other days , depending on the time of year , the sun rises either north or south of true east ( and sets north or south of true west ) . For all locations the sun is seen to rise north of east ( and set north of west ) from the Northward equinox to the Southward equinox , and rise south of east ( and set south of west ) from the Southward equinox to the Northward equinox .   A more accurate fix can be made if the time of year and approximate latitude are factored in . The amount that the sun appears to be either north or south depends on both the time of year and latitude of the observer .

East and west are at right angles to north and south , with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east . Intermediate points between the four cardinal directions form the points of the compass . The intermediate ( intercardinal , or ordinal ) directions are northeast ( NE ) , southeast ( SE ) , southwest ( SW ) , and northwest ( NW ) . Further , the intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction , the eight shortest points in the compass rose to the right , i.   Locating the directions   Direction versus bearing   To keep to a bearing is not , in general , the same as going in a straight direction along a great circle . Conversely , one can keep to a great circle and the bearing may change . Thus the bearing of a straight path crossing the North Pole changes abruptly at the Pole from North to South . Anywhere else , maintaining latitude requires a change in direction , requires steering . However , this change in direction becomes increasingly negligible as one moves to lower latitudes .   Magnetic compass   The Earth has a magnetic field which is approximately aligned with its axis of rotation . A magnetic compass is a device that uses this field to determine the cardinal directions .   The Sun   The position of the Sun in the sky can be used for orientation if the general time of day is known . In the evening it sets in the west , again roughly and only due west exactly on the equinoxes . In the middle of the day it is to the south for viewers in the Northern Hemisphere , who live north of the Tropic of Cancer , and the north for those in the Southern Hemisphere , who live south of the Tropic of Capricorn . This method works less well closer to the equator ( i. between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn ) since , in the northern hemisphere , the sun may be directly overhead or even to the north in summer . Conversely , at low latitudes in the southern hemisphere the sun may be to the south of the observer in summer . In these locations , one needs first to determine whether the sun is moving from east to west through north or south by watching its movements\\u2014left to right means it is going through south while right to left means it is going through north ; or one can watch the sun \'s shadows . If they move clockwise , the sun will be in the south at midday , and if they move anticlockwise , then the sun will be in the north at midday . These days are the equinoxes . For all locations the sun is seen to rise north of east ( and set north of west ) from the Northward equinox to the Southward equinox , and rise south of east ( and set south of west ) from the Southward equinox to the Northward equinox .

Buckland was a proponent of the Gap Theory that interpreted the biblical account of Genesis as referring to two separate episodes of creation separated by a lengthy period ; it emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a way to reconcile the scriptural account with discoveries in geology that suggested the earth was very old . Early in his career he believed that he had found geological evidence of the biblical flood , but later became convinced that the glaciation theory of Louis Agassiz provided a better explanation , and he played an important role in promoting that theory in Great Britain .   Early life and university   Buckland was born at Axminster in DevonChisholm , 1911 and , as a child , would accompany his father , the Rector of Templeton and Trusham , on his walks where interest in road improvements led to collecting fossil shells , including ammonites , from the Jurassic lias rocks exposed in local quarries .   He was educated first at Blundell \'s School , Tiverton , Devon , and then at Winchester College , from where in 1801 he won a scholarship to study for the ministry at Corpus Christi College , Oxford , also attending the lectures of John Kidd on mineralogy and chemistry , as well as developing an interest in geology and carrying out field research on strata , during vacations . Having taken his BA in 1804 , he went on to obtain his MA degree in 1808 . He then became a Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1809 , was ordained as a priest and continued to make frequent geological excursions , on horseback , to various parts of England , Scotland , Ireland and Wales . In 1813 , he was appointed reader in mineralogy , in succession to John Kidd , giving lively and popular lectures with increasing emphasis on geology and palaeontology .

Thus , his catastrophism theory incorporated a version of Old Earth creationism or Gap creationism .

Novels can , on the other hand , depict the social , political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history .   Literary prose   While prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel , the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the Romance language of southern France , especially those by Chr\\u00e9tien de Troyes ( late 12th century ) , and in Middle English ( Geoffrey Chaucer \'s ( c. 1343 \\u2013 1400 ) The Canterbury Tales ) . Even in the 19th century , fictional narratives in verse , such as Lord Byron \'s Don Juan ( 1824 ) , Alexander Pushkin \'s Yevgeniy Onegin ( 1833 ) , and Elizabeth Barrett Browning \'s Aurora Leigh ( 1856 ) , competed with prose novels . Vikram Seth \'s The Golden Gate ( 1986 ) , composed of 590 Onegin stanzas , is a more recent example of the verse novel .   Content : intimate experience   Both in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe , prose fiction created intimate reading situations . On the other hand , verse epics , including the Odyssey and Aeneid , had been recited to a select audiences , though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters .", "question": "in which classic novel does the character queequeg appear?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "the rise of the novel", "modAnswer": "cervantes", "delete sentence number": ["   The genre has also been described as possessing `` a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years \'\' .", "   The romance is a closely related long prose narrative .", " the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents \'\' , whereas in the novel `` the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society \'\' .", " The novel in the modern era usually makes use of a literary prose style , and the development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in printing , and the introduction of cheap paper , in the 15th century .", " Most European languages use the word `` romance \'\' ( as in French , Dutch , Russian , Serbo-Croatian , Romanian , Danish , Swedish and Norwegian `` roman \'\' ;", " Portuguese `` romance \'\' and Italian `` romanzo \'\' ) for extended narratives ."], "distance value": [[4, 0.3951534032821655], [21, 0.3756551444530487], [11, 0.34201881289482117], [19, 0.3331698775291443], [5, 0.3312760889530182], [14, 0.31773489713668823], [2, 0.31090959906578064], [0, 0.29926997423171997], [9, 0.29526007175445557], [3, 0.2899308204650879], [23, 0.28576740622520447], [20, 0.2781282365322113], [16, 0.2712831497192383], [18, 0.2689061760902405], [22, 0.2663519084453583], [24, 0.24144577980041504], [7, 0.23879197239875793], [12, 0.20679013431072235], [10, 0.20565608143806458], [8, 0.17287328839302063], [6, 0.15892437100410461], [13, 0.14923913776874542], [1, 0.1398051381111145], [17, 0.10548898577690125], [15, 0.02130476012825966]]}\n', '{"test case number": 423, "context": "Troy ( , Troia and , Ilion , or , Ilios ; and ; Tr\\u014dia is the typical Latin name for the city .

The navy was first created to support Manuel Belgrano in the Paraguay campaign , but it was sunk by ships from Montevideo , and did not take part in that conflict . Renewed conflicts with Montevideo led to the creation of a second fleet , which participated in the capture of the city . As Buenos Aires had little maritime history , most men in the navy were from other nations , such as the Irish-born admiral William Brown , who directed the operation . As the cost of maintaining a navy was too high , most of the Argentine naval forces were composed of privateers .   Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the R\\u00edo de la Plata .   In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself . At the close of the century , the force included :   * 5 armoured cruisers  * 4 coastal defence ironclads  * 3 second-class , high-speed , British-built cruisers  * 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats  * 4 destroyers and  * 22 torpedo boats .   The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships : , , and , each at over 6,000 tons . Three older ironclads , , , and dated from the 1880s and early 1890s .   The navy \'s ships were built primarily in Italy , Britain , France , and Spain and were operated by over 600 officers and 7760 seamen . These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery .   20th century   Argentina remained neutral in both world wars . In 1940 , Argentina \'s navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world ( after the European powers , Japan , and the United States ) and the largest in Latin America . A ten-year building programme costing $ 60 million had produced a force of 14,500 sailors and over a thousand officers . The fleet included two First World War-era ( but modernized ) American-built s , three modern cruisers , a dozen British-built destroyers , and three submarines in addition to minelayers , minesweepers , coastal defence ships , and gunboats . A naval air force was also in operation .   In the postwar period , Naval Aviation and Marine Corps units were put under direct Navy command .

The Argentine Navy has been traditionally heavily involved in fishery inspection helping the Coast Guard : most notably in 1966 a destroyer fired on and holed a Soviet trawler that had refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata , in the 1970s there were four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships and continued in recent years .   The Navy also took part in all military coups through the 20th century . During the last dictatorship , Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War of the late 1970s in which thousands of people were kidnapped , tortured and killed by the forces of the Military Junta .

As Buenos Aires had little maritime history , most men in the navy were from other nations , such as the Irish-born admiral William Brown , who directed the operation . As the cost of maintaining a navy was too high , most of the Argentine naval forces were composed of privateers .   Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the R\\u00edo de la Plata .   In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself . At the close of the century , the force included :   * 5 armoured cruisers  * 4 coastal defence ironclads  * 3 second-class , high-speed , British-built cruisers  * 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats  * 4 destroyers and  * 22 torpedo boats .   The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships : , , and , each at over 6,000 tons .   The navy \'s ships were built primarily in Italy , Britain , France , and Spain and were operated by over 600 officers and 7760 seamen . These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery . In 1940 , Argentina \'s navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world ( after the European powers , Japan , and the United States ) and the largest in Latin America . The fleet included two First World War-era ( but modernized ) American-built s , three modern cruisers , a dozen British-built destroyers , and three submarines in addition to minelayers , minesweepers , coastal defence ships , and gunboats . A naval air force was also in operation .   In the postwar period , Naval Aviation and Marine Corps units were put under direct Navy command .   The Argentine Navy has been traditionally heavily involved in fishery inspection helping the Coast Guard : most notably in 1966 a destroyer fired on and holed a Soviet trawler that had refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata , in the 1970s there were four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships and continued in recent years . During the last dictatorship , Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War of the late 1970s in which thousands of people were kidnapped , tortured and killed by the forces of the Military Junta . Among their more well-known victims were the Swedish teenager Dagmar Hagelin and French nuns , Alice Domon and L\\u00e9onie Duquet ( In October 2007 the Argentine Navy formally handed possession of the school to human rights groups to turn into a memorial museum ) . During this regime , the Navy was also the main supporter of a military solution for the country \'s two longest standing disputes : the Beagle Conflict with Chile and the Falkland Islands ( ) with the United Kingdom .", "question": "what was the name of the argentine navy cruiser which was torpedoed and sunk during the 1982 falklands war?", "groundTruth": "manuel belgrano", "answer": "the s/s nova del mar", "modAnswer": "the s/s s/s marino", "delete sentence number": [" Renewed conflicts with Montevideo led to the creation of a second fleet , which participated in the capture of the city .", " Three older ironclads , , , and dated from the 1880s and early 1890s .", "   20th century   Argentina remained neutral in both world wars .", " A ten-year building programme costing $ 60 million had produced a force of 14,500 sailors and over a thousand officers .", " With Brazil , Argentina is one of two South American countries to have operated two aircraft carriers : the and .", "   The Navy also took part in all military coups through the 20th century .", " The Naval Mechanics School , known as ESMA , was a notorious centre for torture ."], "distance value": [[8, 0.5780176520347595], [23, 0.5674508810043335], [28, 0.5588721036911011], [2, 0.5427201390266418], [9, 0.5253869295120239], [19, 0.5132833123207092], [0, 0.49965956807136536], [20, 0.4823349416255951], [11, 0.4799571931362152], [10, 0.47903454303741455], [1, 0.47414276003837585], [21, 0.4709010124206543], [4, 0.46406090259552], [14, 0.43530312180519104], [5, 0.4309110641479492], [17, 0.42288580536842346], [15, 0.4101516008377075], [3, 0.39359214901924133], [25, 0.37765419483184814], [12, 0.36928611993789673], [27, 0.35942506790161133], [7, 0.3495570421218872], [6, 0.347007155418396], [24, 0.3438844382762909], [22, 0.3167259097099304], [26, 0.3090797960758209], [18, 0.30433735251426697], [16, 0.2863413095474243], [13, 0.16955097019672394]]}\n', '{"test case number": 457, "context": "An introduced , alien , exotic , non-indigenous , or non-native species , or simply an introduction , is a species living outside its native distributional range , which has arrived there by human activity , either deliberate or accidental .

The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed , maneuverability , and small size relative to other combat aircraft .   Many fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities , and some are designed as dual-purpose fighter-bombers ; often aircraft that do not fulfill the standard definition are called fighters . This may be for political or national security reasons , for advertising purposes , or other reasons .   A fighter \'s main purpose is to establish air superiority over a battlefield . Since World War I , achieving and maintaining air superiority has been considered essential for victory in conventional warfare . The success or failure of a belligerent \'s efforts to gain air supremacy hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots , the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters , and the numbers and performance of those fighters . Because of the importance of air superiority , since the dawn of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers , and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces .   Terminology   The word `` fighter \'\' did not become the official English-language term for such aircraft until after World War I . In the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force these aircraft were referred to as `` scouts \'\' into the early 1920s . The U.S. Army called their fighters `` pursuit \'\' aircraft from 1916 until the late 1940s . In most languages a fighter aircraft is known as a hunter , or hunting aircraft ( avion de chasse , jagdflugzeuge , avi\\u00f3n de caza etc . ) . Exceptions include Russian , where a fighter is an `` \\u0438\\u0441\\u0442\\u0440\\u0435\\u0431\\u0438\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c \'\' ( pronounced `` istrebitel \'\' ) , meaning `` exterminator \'\' , and Hebrew where it is `` matose krav \'\' ( literally `` battle plane \'\' ) .   As a part of military nomenclature , a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use , along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft . The letters used to designate a fighter differ in various countries \\u2014 in the English-speaking world , `` F \'\' is now used to indicate a fighter ( e.g . F-35 or Spitfire F.22 ) , though when the pursuit designation was used in the US , they were `` P \'\' types ( e.g . P-40 ) . In Russia `` I \'\' was used ( I-16 ) , while the French continue to use `` C \'\' ( Nieuport 17 C.1 ) .   Although the term `` fighter \'\' specifies aircraft designed to shoot down other aircraft , such designs are often also useful as multirole fighter-bombers , strike fighters , and sometimes lighter , fighter-sized tactical ground-attack aircraft . This has always been the case , for instance the Sopwith Camel and other `` fighting scouts \'\' of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work . In World War II , the USAAF and RAF often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or dive bombers , and types such as the P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Hurricane that were no longer competitive aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack . Several aircraft , such as the F-111 and F-117 , have received fighter designations but had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons . The F-111B variant was originally intended for a fighter role with the U.S. Navy , but it was cancelled . This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for `` attack \'\' or `` strike \'\' operations against ground targets by means of strafing or dropping small bombs and incendiaries . Versatile multirole fighter-bombers such as the F/A-18 Hornet are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types .

Development overview   Fighters were developed in World War I to deny enemy aircraft and dirigibles the ability to gather information by reconnaissance .", "modContext": "A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft , as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft , whose main mission is to attack ground targets . The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed , maneuverability , and small size relative to other combat aircraft .   Many fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities , and some are designed as dual-purpose fighter-bombers ; often aircraft that do not fulfill the standard definition are called fighters . This may be for political or national security reasons , for advertising purposes , or other reasons .   A fighter \'s main purpose is to establish air superiority over a battlefield . Since World War I , achieving and maintaining air superiority has been considered essential for victory in conventional warfare . The success or failure of a belligerent \'s efforts to gain air supremacy hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots , the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters , and the numbers and performance of those fighters . Because of the importance of air superiority , since the dawn of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers , and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces .   Terminology   The word `` fighter \'\' did not become the official English-language term for such aircraft until after World War I .S. Army called their fighters `` pursuit \'\' aircraft from 1916 until the late 1940s . In most languages a fighter aircraft is known as a hunter , or hunting aircraft ( avion de chasse , jagdflugzeuge , avi\\u00f3n de caza etc . Exceptions include Russian , where a fighter is an `` \\u0438\\u0441\\u0442\\u0440\\u0435\\u0431\\u0438\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c \'\' ( pronounced `` istrebitel \'\' ) , meaning `` exterminator \'\' , and Hebrew where it is `` matose krav \'\' ( literally `` battle plane \'\' ) .   As a part of military nomenclature , a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use , along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft .g . F-35 or Spitfire F. In Russia `` I \'\' was used ( I-16 ) , while the French continue to use `` C \'\' ( Nieuport 17 C.1 ) . This has always been the case , for instance the Sopwith Camel and other `` fighting scouts \'\' of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work . In World War II , the USAAF and RAF often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or dive bombers , and types such as the P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Hurricane that were no longer competitive aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack . Several aircraft , such as the F-111 and F-117 , have received fighter designations but had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons .S. Navy , but it was cancelled . This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for `` attack \'\' or `` strike \'\' operations against ground targets by means of strafing or dropping small bombs and incendiaries . Versatile multirole fighter-bombers such as the F/A-18 Hornet are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types .

Starting in the late 1920s , comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories , as seen in Popeye , Captain Easy , Buck Rogers , Tarzan , and The Adventures of Tintin . Soap-opera continuity strips such as Judge Parker and Mary Worth gained popularity in the 1940s . All are called , generically , comic strips , though cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that `` sequential art \'\' would be a better genre-neutral name .   In the UK and the rest of Europe , comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines , with a strip \'s story sometimes continuing over three pages or more . Comic strips have appeared in American magazines such as Liberty and Boys \' Life and also on the front covers of magazines , such as the Flossy Frills series on The American Weekly Sunday newspaper supplement .   History   Storytelling using a sequence of pictures has existed through history . One medieval European example in textile form is the Bayeux Tapestry . Printed examples emerged in 19th-century Germany and in 18th-century England , where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced . William Hogarth \'s 18th century English cartoons include both narrative sequences , such as A Rake \'s Progress , and single panels .   The Biblia pauperum ( `` Paupers \' Bible \'\' ) , a tradition of picture Bibles beginning in the later Middle Ages , sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the miniatures written on scrolls coming out of their mouths\\u2014which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips .   In China , with its traditions of block printing and of the incorporation of text with image , experiments with what became lianhuanhua date back to 1884 .   Newspapers   The first newspaper comic strips appeared in North America in the late 19th century . The Yellow Kid is usually credited as the first . However , the art form combining words and pictures developed gradually and there are many examples which led up to the comic strip .   Swiss author and caricature artist Rodolphe T\\u00f6pffer ( Geneva , 1799\\u20131846 ) is considered the father of the modern comic strips . His illustrated stories such as Histoire de M. Vieux Bois ( 1827 ) , first published in the USA in 1842 as The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck or Histoire de Monsieur Jabot ( 1831 ) , inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists . In 1865 , German painter , author , and caricaturist Wilhelm Busch created the strip Max and Moritz , about two trouble-making boys , which had a direct influence on the American comic strip . Max and Moritz was a series of severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children \'s stories such as Struwwelpeter ( `` Shockheaded Peter \'\' ) ; in one , the boys , after perpetrating some mischief , are tossed into a sack of grain , run through a mill , and consumed by a flock of geese . Max and Moritz provided an inspiration for German immigrant Rudolph Dirks , who created the Katzenjammer Kids in 1897 .

West Africa has been defined as including the 18 countries Benin , Burkina Faso , the island of Cape Verde , Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , the island of Saint Helena , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Sao Tome and Principe and Togo .   History   The history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods : first , its prehistory , in which the first human settlers arrived , developed agriculture , and made contact with peoples to the north ; the second , the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-African , and extra-African trade , and developed centralized states ; third , major polities flourished , which would undergo an extensive history of contact with non-Africans ; fourth , the colonial period , in which Great Britain and France controlled nearly the whole of the region ; and fifth , the post-independence era , in which the current nations were formed .   Prehistory   Early human settlers from northern Holocene societies arrived in West Africa around 12,000 B.C . Sedentary farming began in , or around the fifth millennium B.C , as well as the domestication of cattle . By 1500 B.C , ironworking technology allowed an expansion of agricultural productivity , and the first city-states later formed . Northern tribes developed walled settlements and non-walled settlements that numbered at 400 . In the forest region , Iron Age cultures began to flourish , and an inter-region trade began to appear . The desertification of the Sahara and the climatic change of the coast cause trade with upper Mediterranean peoples to be seen .   The domestication of the camel allowed the development of a trans-Saharan trade with cultures across the Sahara , including Carthage and the Berbers ; major exports included gold , cotton cloth , metal ornaments and leather goods , which were then exchanged for salt , horses , textiles , and other such materials . Local leather , cloth , and gold also contributed to the abundance of prosperity for many of the following empires .   Empires   The development of the region \'s economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form , beginning with the Nok culture that began in 1000 B.C . and the Ghana Empire that first flourished between the 1st and 3rd centuries , which later gave way to the Mali Empire .

West Africa has been defined as including the 18 countries Benin , Burkina Faso , the island of Cape Verde , Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , the island of Saint Helena , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Sao Tome and Principe and Togo .   History   The history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods : first , its prehistory , in which the first human settlers arrived , developed agriculture , and made contact with peoples to the north ; the second , the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-African , and extra-African trade , and developed centralized states ; and fifth , the post-independence era , in which the current nations were formed .C , as well as the domestication of cattle . By 1500 B.C , ironworking technology allowed an expansion of agricultural productivity , and the first city-states later formed . Northern tribes developed walled settlements and non-walled settlements that numbered at 400 . In the forest region , Iron Age cultures began to flourish , and an inter-region trade began to appear .   The domestication of the camel allowed the development of a trans-Saharan trade with cultures across the Sahara , including Carthage and the Berbers ; major exports included gold , cotton cloth , metal ornaments and leather goods , which were then exchanged for salt , horses , textiles , and other such materials .   Empires   The development of the region \'s economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form , beginning with the Nok culture that began in 1000 B.C . and the Ghana Empire that first flourished between the 1st and 3rd centuries , which later gave way to the Mali Empire .

Measuring tempo   A piece of music \'s tempo is typically written at the start of the score , and in modern Western music is usually indicated in beats per minute ( bpm ) . This means that a particular note value ( for example , a quarter note , or crotchet ) is specified as the beat , and that the amount of time between successive beats is a specified fraction of a minute . The greater the number of beats per minute , the smaller the amount of time between successive beats , and thus faster a piece must be played . For example , a tempo of 60 beats per minute signifies one beat per second , while a tempo of 120 beats per minute is twice as rapid , signifying one beat every 0.5 seconds . Mathematical tempo markings of this kind became increasingly popular during the first half of the 19th century , after the metronome had been invented by Johann Nepomuk Maelzel , although early metronomes were somewhat inconsistent . Beethoven was one of the first composers to use the metronome ; in the 1810s he published metronomic indications for the eight symphonies he had composed up to that time.Some of these markings are today contentious , such as those on his `` Hammerklavier \'\' Sonata and Ninth Symphony , seeming to many to be almost impossibly fast , as is also the case for many of the works of Schumann . See `` metronome \'\' entry in Apel ( 1969 ) , p. 523 .   With the advent of modern electronics , bpm became an extremely precise measure . Music sequencers use the bpm system to denote tempo .   Instead of beats per minute , some 20th-century composers ( e.g. , B\\u00e9la Bart\\u00f3k , Alberto Ginastera , and John Cage ) specify the total playing time for a piece , from which the performer can derive tempo .   Tempo is as crucial in contemporary music as it is in classical . In electronic dance music , accurate knowledge of a tune \'s bpm is important to DJs for the purposes of beatmatching .   Musical vocabulary for tempo   Some musical pieces do not have a mathematical time indication . In classical music it is customary to describe the tempo of a piece by one or more words . Most of these words are Italian , because many of the most important composers of the 17th century were Italian , and this period was when tempo indications were first used extensively and codified .   Before the metronome , it was difficult to specify the tempo of a composition ; attempts were made using pendulums or the human pulse . Yet , after the metronome \'s invention , musicians continued to use these words , often additionally indicating the mood of the piece . This blurred the traditional distinction between tempo and mood indicators . For example , presto and allegro both indicate a speedy execution ( presto being faster ) , but allegro also connotes joy ( from its original meaning in Italian ) . Presto , on the other hand , simply indicates speed . Additional Italian words also indicate tempo and mood .

In general , in organisms that reproduce sexually , an embryo develops from a zygote , the single cell resulting from the fertilization of the female egg cell by the male sperm cell . The zygote possesses half the DNA of each of its two parents . In plants , animals , and some protists , the zygote will begin to divide by mitosis to produce a multicellular organism . The result of this process is an embryo .   In humans , a pregnancy is generally considered to be in the embryonic stage of development between the fifth and the eleventh weeks after fertilization , and is considered a fetus from the twelfth week on .   Etymology   First attested in English in the mid-14c. , the word embryon derives from Medieval Latin embryo , itself from Greek ( embruon ) , lit . `` young one \'\' , which is the neuter of ( embruos ) , lit . `` growing in \'\' , from \\u1f10\\u03bd ( en ) , `` in \'\' and \\u03b2\\u03c1\\u03cd\\u03c9 ( bru\\u014d ) , `` swell , be full \'\' ; the proper Latinized form of the Greek term would be embryum .   Development   In animals , the development of the zygote into an embryo proceeds through specific recognizable stages of blastula , gastrula , and organogenesis . The blastula stage typically features a fluid-filled cavity , the blastocoel , surrounded by a sphere or sheet of cells , also called blastomeres . In a placental mammal , an ovum is fertilized in a fallopian tube through which it travels into the uterus . An embryo is called a fetus at a more advanced stage of development and up until birth or hatching . In humans , this is from the eleventh week of gestation . However , animals which develop in eggs outside the mother \'s body , are usually referred to as embryos throughout development ; e.g . one would refer to a chick embryo , not a `` chick fetus , \'\' even at later stages .   During gastrulation the cells of the blastula undergo coordinated processes of cell division , invasion , and/or migration to form two ( diploblastic ) or three ( triploblastic ) tissue layers . In triploblastic organisms , the three germ layers are called endoderm , ectoderm , and mesoderm . The position and arrangement of the germ layers are highly species-specific , however , depending on the type of embryo produced . In vertebrates , a special population of embryonic cells called the neural crest has been proposed as a `` fourth germ layer \'\' , and is thought to have been an important novelty in the evolution of head structures .   During organogenesis , molecular and cellular interactions between germ layers , combined with the cells \' developmental potential , or competence to respond , prompt the further differentiation of organ-specific cell types . For example , in neurogenesis , a subpopulation of ectoderm cells is set aside to become the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral nerves . Modern developmental biology is extensively probing the molecular basis for every type of organogenesis , including angiogenesis ( formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones ) , chondrogenesis ( cartilage ) , myogenesis ( muscle ) , osteogenesis ( bone ) , and many others .   Generally , if a structure pre-dates another structure in evolutionary terms , then it often appears earlier than the second in an embryo ; this general observation is sometimes summarized by the phrase `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny \'\' . For example , the backbone is a common structure among all vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , and mammals , and the backbone also appears as one of the earliest structures laid out in all vertebrate embryos . The cerebrum in humans , which is the most sophisticated part of the brain , develops last . This sequencing rule is not absolute , but it is recognized as being partly applicable to development of the human embryo .   Plant embryos   In botany , a seed plant embryo is part of a seed , consisting of precursor tissues for the leaves , stem ( see hypocotyl ) , and root ( see radicle ) , as well as one or more cotyledons . Once the embryo begins to germinate \\u2014 grow out from the seed \\u2014 it is called a seedling ( plantlet ) .   Bryophytes and ferns also produce an embryo , but do not produce seeds .

In vertebrates , a special population of embryonic cells called the neural crest has been proposed as a `` fourth germ layer \'\' , and is thought to have been an important novelty in the evolution of head structures .   During organogenesis , molecular and cellular interactions between germ layers , combined with the cells \' developmental potential , or competence to respond , prompt the further differentiation of organ-specific cell types . For example , in neurogenesis , a subpopulation of ectoderm cells is set aside to become the brain , spinal cord , and peripheral nerves . Modern developmental biology is extensively probing the molecular basis for every type of organogenesis , including angiogenesis ( formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones ) , chondrogenesis ( cartilage ) , myogenesis ( muscle ) , osteogenesis ( bone ) , and many others . this general observation is sometimes summarized by the phrase `` ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny \'\' . For example , the backbone is a common structure among all vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , and mammals , and the backbone also appears as one of the earliest structures laid out in all vertebrate embryos . The cerebrum in humans , which is the most sophisticated part of the brain , develops last . This sequencing rule is not absolute , but it is recognized as being partly applicable to development of the human embryo .   Plant embryos   In botany , a seed plant embryo is part of a seed , consisting of precursor tissues for the leaves , stem ( see hypocotyl ) , and root ( see radicle ) , as well as one or more cotyledons . Once the embryo begins to germinate \\u2014 grow out from the seed \\u2014 it is called a seedling ( plantlet ) .

Bond is assigned the task of following a general who is stealing jewels and relics from the Soviet government . This leads him to a wealthy Afghan prince , Kamal Khan , and his associate , Octopussy . Bond uncovers a plot to force disarmament in Europe with the use of a nuclear weapon .   Octopussy was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson , and was released in the same year as the non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again . The film was written by George MacDonald Fraser , Richard Maibaum , and Michael G. Wilson , and was directed by John Glen .   Plot   British agent 009 is found dead at the British embassy in East Berlin , dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Faberg\\u00e9 egg . MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and , after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London , sends James Bond to investigate and find out the identity of the seller . At the auction , Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan , forcing Khan to pay \\u00a3500,000 for the fake egg . Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan , India , where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon . Bond escapes with his Indian colleague Vijay , evading Khan \'s bodyguard Gobinda \'s attempts to kill them both . Bond is seduced by one of Khan \'s associates , Magda , and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo . Bond permits Magda to steal the real Faberg\\u00e9 egg fitted with a listening device by Q , while Gobinda captures Bond and takes him to Khan \'s palace . After Bond escapes from his cell he listens in on the bug in the Faberg\\u00e9 egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov , a Soviet general , who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe .   After escaping from Khan \'s palace , Bond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur , India , and there finds its owner , Octopussy , a wealthy business woman and smuggler and an associate of Khan . She also leads the Octopus cult , of which Magda is a member . In Octopussy \'s palace , Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures , replacing them with replicas while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West via Octopussy \'s circus troupe . Orlov is planning to meet Khan at Karl-Marx-Stadt ( Chemnitz ) in East Germany , where the circus is scheduled to perform . After evading Khan \'s assassins , who killed Vijay , Bond goes to East Germany .   Bond infiltrates the circus and finds that Orlov replaced the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead , primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany . The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament in the belief that the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident , leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion .

It does , however , include a scene inspired by the Fleming short story `` The Property of a Lady \'\' ( included in 1967 and later editions of Octopussy and The Living Daylights ) , while the events of the short story `` Octopussy \'\' form a part of the title character \'s background and are recounted by her .   Bond is assigned the task of following a general who is stealing jewels and relics from the Soviet government . This leads him to a wealthy Afghan prince , Kamal Khan , and his associate , Octopussy . Bond uncovers a plot to force disarmament in Europe with the use of a nuclear weapon .   Octopussy was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson , and was released in the same year as the non-Eon Bond film Never Say Never Again . The film was written by George MacDonald Fraser , Richard Maibaum , and Michael G. Wilson , and was directed by John Glen . Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan , India , where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon . Bond escapes with his Indian colleague Vijay , evading Khan \'s bodyguard Gobinda \'s attempts to kill them both . Bond is seduced by one of Khan \'s associates , Magda , and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo . Bond permits Magda to steal the real Faberg\\u00e9 egg fitted with a listening device by Q , while Gobinda captures Bond and takes him to Khan \'s palace . After Bond escapes from his cell he listens in on the bug in the Faberg\\u00e9 egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov , a Soviet general , who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe .   After escaping from Khan \'s palace , Bond infiltrates a floating palace in Udaipur , India , and there finds its owner , Octopussy , a wealthy business woman and smuggler and an associate of Khan . In Octopussy \'s palace , Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures , replacing them with replicas while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West via Octopussy \'s circus troupe . After evading Khan \'s assassins , who killed Vijay , Bond goes to East Germany .   Bond infiltrates the circus and finds that Orlov replaced the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead , primed to explode during the circus show at a US Air Force base in West Germany . Bond takes Orlov \'s car , drives it along the train tracks and boards the moving circus train . Bond kills the twin knife-throwers Mischka and Grischka in revenge for 009 \'s death , and , after falling from the train , commandeers a car to get to the Air Force base . At the base , Bond disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police .", "question": "former tennis player vijay armitrage apears in which james bond film?", "groundTruth": "octopussy", "answer": "the sixth film in the series", "modAnswer": "Octopussy", "delete sentence number": ["   Plot   British agent 009 is found dead at the British embassy in East Berlin , dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Faberg\\u00e9 egg .", " MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and , after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London , sends James Bond to investigate and find out the identity of the seller .", " At the auction , Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan , forcing Khan to pay \\u00a3500,000 for the fake egg .", " She also leads the Octopus cult , of which Magda is a member .", " Orlov is planning to meet Khan at Karl-Marx-Stadt ( Chemnitz ) in East Germany , where the circus is scheduled to perform .", " The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament in the belief that the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident , leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion .", " Orlov is shot dead by GDR guards while trying to follow the train across the border into West Germany , who assume that he is attempting to defect to the West ."], "distance value": [[0, 0.455990731716156], [14, 0.43369099497795105], [8, 0.4123058021068573], [16, 0.3898649215698242], [1, 0.3746258020401001], [15, 0.36719465255737305], [19, 0.34017419815063477], [28, 0.33361008763313293], [9, 0.329762727022171], [21, 0.3277369737625122], [23, 0.3243020176887512], [3, 0.3210926055908203], [10, 0.2858962416648865], [24, 0.27821508049964905], [29, 0.26495489478111267], [26, 0.2568640112876892], [6, 0.25599440932273865], [7, 0.2540262043476105], [17, 0.2539469003677368], [5, 0.25355061888694763], [4, 0.2400558590888977], [18, 0.237290620803833], [2, 0.22462742030620575], [13, 0.22342051565647125], [12, 0.22010713815689087], [11, 0.17642441391944885], [22, 0.09895825386047363], [20, 0.07698260992765427], [27, 0.05440407991409302], [25, -0.002150743268430233]]}\n', '{"test case number": 623, "context": "What \'s Love Got to Do with It is a 1993 American biographical film directed by Brian Gibson , loosely based on the life of Tina Turner .

R. R. Tolkien . It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim , being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction . The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children \'s literature .   Set in a time `` Between the Dawn of F\\u00e6rie and the Dominion of Men \'\' , The Hobbit follows the quest of home-loving hobbit Bilbo Baggins to win a share of the treasure guarded by the dragon , Smaug . Bilbo \'s journey takes him from light-hearted , rural surroundings into more sinister territory . The story is told in the form of an episodic quest , and most chapters introduce a specific creature , or type of creature , of Tolkien \'s geography . By accepting the disreputable , romantic , fey and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense , Bilbo gains a new level of maturity , competence and wisdom . The story reaches its climax in the Battle of the Five Armies , where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict .   Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story . Along with motifs of warfare , these themes have led critics to view Tolkien \'s own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story . The author \'s scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences .   Encouraged by the book \'s critical and financial success , the publisher requested a sequel . As Tolkien \'s work on the successor The Lord of the Rings progressed , he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit . These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition . Further editions followed with minor emendations , including those reflecting Tolkien \'s changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled . The work has never been out of print . Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage , screen , radio , board games and video games . Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits .   Characters   Bilbo Baggins , the titular protagonist , is a respectable , reserved hobbit . During his adventure , Bilbo often refers to the contents of his larder at home and wishes he had more food . Until he finds a magic ring , he is more baggage than help . Gandalf , an itinerant wizard , introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves . During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at , only to appear again at key moments in the story . Thorin Oakenshield , the proud , pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain , makes many mistakes in his leadership , relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to get him out of trouble , but he proves himself a mighty warrior . Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin \'s grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure .   The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance , such as the twelve other dwarves of the company ; two types of elves : both puckish and more serious warrior types ; Men ; man-eating trolls ; boulder-throwing giants ; evil cave-dwelling goblins ; forest-dwelling giant spiders who can speak ; immense and heroic eagles who also speak ; evil wolves , or wargs , who are allied with the goblins ; Elrond the sage ; Gollum , a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake ; Beorn , a man who can assume bear form ; and Bard the Bowman , a grim but honourable archer of Lake-town .   Plot   Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of dwarves , who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the dragon Smaug . When the music ends , Gandalf unveils a map showing a secret door into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition \'s `` burglar \'\' . The dwarves ridicule the idea , but Bilbo , indignant , joins despite himself .

It was published on 21 September 1937 to wide critical acclaim , being nominated for the Carnegie Medal and awarded a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction . The book remains popular and is recognized as a classic in children \'s literature .   Set in a time `` Between the Dawn of F\\u00e6rie and the Dominion of Men \'\' , The Hobbit follows the quest of home-loving hobbit Bilbo Baggins to win a share of the treasure guarded by the dragon , Smaug . The story is told in the form of an episodic quest , and most chapters introduce a specific creature , or type of creature , of Tolkien \'s geography . The story reaches its climax in the Battle of the Five Armies , where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict .   Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story . Along with motifs of warfare , these themes have led critics to view Tolkien \'s own experiences during World War I as instrumental in shaping the story . The author \'s scholarly knowledge of Germanic philology and interest in fairy tales are often noted as influences .   Encouraged by the book \'s critical and financial success , the publisher requested a sequel . As Tolkien \'s work on the successor The Lord of the Rings progressed , he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit . These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition . Further editions followed with minor emendations , including those reflecting Tolkien \'s changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled . Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage , screen , radio , board games and video games . Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits .   Characters   Bilbo Baggins , the titular protagonist , is a respectable , reserved hobbit . Gandalf , an itinerant wizard , introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves . During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at , only to appear again at key moments in the story . Thorin Oakenshield , the proud , pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain , makes many mistakes in his leadership , relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to get him out of trouble , but he proves himself a mighty warrior .   The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance , such as the twelve other dwarves of the company ; two types of elves : both puckish and more serious warrior types ; Men ; man-eating trolls ; boulder-throwing giants ; evil cave-dwelling goblins ; forest-dwelling giant spiders who can speak ; immense and heroic eagles who also speak ; evil wolves , or wargs , who are allied with the goblins ; Elrond the sage ; Gollum , a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake ; Beorn , a man who can assume bear form ; and Bard the Bowman , a grim but honourable archer of Lake-town .   Plot   Gandalf tricks Bilbo into hosting a party for Thorin and his band of dwarves , who sing of reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and its vast treasure from the dragon Smaug . When the music ends , Gandalf unveils a map showing a secret door into the Mountain and proposes that the dumbfounded Bilbo serve as the expedition \'s `` burglar \'\' . The dwarves ridicule the idea , but Bilbo , indignant , joins despite himself .   The group travels into the wild , where Gandalf saves the company from trolls and leads them to Rivendell , where Elrond reveals more secrets from the map .", "question": "\\"how many films were made by director sir peter jackson from tolkien\'s short book, \\"\\"the hobbit\\"\\"?\\"", "groundTruth": "3", "answer": "three", "modAnswer": "12", "delete sentence number": [" R.", " R.", " Bilbo \'s journey takes him from light-hearted , rural surroundings into more sinister territory .", " By accepting the disreputable , romantic , fey and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense , Bilbo gains a new level of maturity , competence and wisdom .", " The work has never been out of print .", " During his adventure , Bilbo often refers to the contents of his larder at home and wishes he had more food .", " Until he finds a magic ring , he is more baggage than help .", " Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin \'s grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure ."], "distance value": [[3, 0.5651897192001343], [15, 0.5597021579742432], [8, 0.4775511622428894], [0, 0.4767390191555023], [12, 0.46782636642456055], [17, 0.4655129313468933], [6, 0.39933502674102783], [21, 0.3884658217430115], [5, 0.3638646900653839], [10, 0.3240528106689453], [14, 0.32009896636009216], [28, 0.302480548620224], [25, 0.2558651566505432], [26, 0.23841744661331177], [19, 0.21356269717216492], [29, 0.20679764449596405], [4, 0.20646530389785767], [31, 0.20571774244308472], [13, 0.19676104187965393], [24, 0.1954486072063446], [30, 0.1912136971950531], [32, 0.19087213277816772], [20, 0.17771178483963013], [11, 0.17734062671661377], [16, 0.1765347123146057], [27, 0.1732597053050995], [22, 0.15943102538585663], [7, 0.14931711554527283], [23, 0.12230195850133896], [18, 0.10398662090301514], [9, 0.05670357868075371], [1, 0.016875427216291428], [2, 0.016875416040420532]]}\n', '{"test case number": 646, "context": "Macau ( ; ) , also spelled Macao , officially the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People \'s Republic of China , is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta , China .

In the historiography of some countries , the war is named after combatants in its respective theatres , e.g . the French and Indian War in the United States . In French-speaking Canada , it is known as the War of the Conquest , while it is called the Seven Years \' War in English-speaking Canada ( North America , 1754\\u20131763 ) , Pomeranian War ( with Sweden and Prussia , 1757\\u20131762 ) , Third Carnatic War ( on the Indian subcontinent , 1757\\u20131763 ) , and Third Silesian War ( with Prussia and Austria , 1756\\u20131763 ) .   Conflict between Great Britain and France broke out in 1754\\u20131756 when the British attacked disputed French positions in North America and seized hundreds of French merchant ships . Meanwhile , rising power Prussia was struggling with Austria for dominance within and outside the Holy Roman Empire in central Europe . In 1756 , the major powers `` switched partners \'\' .   Realizing that war was imminent , Prussia preemptively struck Saxony and quickly overran it . The result caused uproar across Europe . Because of Prussia \'s alliance with Britain , Austria formed an alliance with France , seeing an opportunity to recapture Silesia , which had been lost in a previous war . Reluctantly , by following the imperial diet , most of the states of the empire joined Austria \'s cause . The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by smaller German states ( especially Hanover ) . Sweden , fearing Prussia \'s expansionist tendencies , went to war in 1757 to protect its Baltic dominions , seeing its chance when virtually all of Europe opposed Prussia . Spain , bound by the Pacte de Famille , intervened on behalf of France and together they launched an utterly unsuccessful invasion of Portugal in 1762 . The Russian Empire was originally aligned with Austria , fearing Prussia \'s ambition on the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth , but switched sides upon the succession of Tsar Peter III in 1762 .   Many middle and small powers in Europe , unlike in the previous wars , tried to steer clear away from the escalating conflict , even though they had interests in the conflict or with the belligerents , like Denmark-Norway . The Dutch Republic , a long-time British ally , kept its neutrality intact , fearing the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe , and even tried to prevent Britain \'s domination in India . Naples , Sicily , and Savoy , although sided with the Franco-Spanish alliance , declined to join the coalition under fear of British power . The taxation needed for war caused the Russian people considerable hardship , being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by Empress Elizabeth in 1759 to complete her addition to the Winter Palace . Like Sweden , Russia concluded a separate peace with Prussia .   The war ended with the Treaty of Paris between France , Spain and Great Britain and the Treaty of Hubertusburg between Saxony , Austria and Prussia , in 1763 .   The war was successful for Great Britain , which gained the bulk of New France in North America , Spanish Florida , some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies , the colony of Senegal on the West African coast , and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent . The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement ; a subsequent conflict , known as Pontiac \'s War , was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status . In Europe , the war began disastrously for Prussia , but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw King Frederick the Great manage to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum .

Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers ; while most set a threshold of three murders , others extend it to four or lessen it to two . The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , for example , defines serial killing as `` a series of two or more murders , committed as separate events , usually , but not always , by one offender acting alone \'\' .   Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrillseeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion , and the victims may have something in common : age group , appearance , gender , or race , for example .   Serial killing is not the same as mass murdering ( killing numerous people in a given incident ) ; nor is it spree killing ( in which murders are committed in two or more locations , in a short time ) . However , cases of extended bouts of sequential killings over periods of weeks or months with no apparent `` cooling off period \'\' or `` return to normalcy \'\' have caused some experts to suggest a hybrid category of `` spree-serial killer \'\' .   Etymology   The English term and concept of `` serial killer \'\' are commonly attributed to former FBI Special agent Robert Ressler in 1974 . Author Ann Rule postulates in her book Kiss Me , Kill Me ( 2004 ) that the English-language credit for coining the term serial killer goes to LAPD detective Pierce Brooks , who created the ViCAP system in 1985 . However , in his book Serial Killers : The Method and Madness of Monsters ( 2004 ) , criminal justice historian Peter Vronsky argues that while Ressler might have coined the term serial homicide within law , at Bramshill Police Academy in Britain , the terms serial murder and serial murderer appear in John Brophy \'s book The Meaning of Murder ( 1966 ) . In his more recent study , Vronsky states that the term `` serial killing \'\' first entered into American popular usage when published in the New York Times in the spring of 1981 , to describe Atlanta serial killer Wayne Williams . Subsequently , throughout the 1980s , the term was used in the pages of the New York Times on 233 occasions , but by the end of the 1990s , in the publication \'s second decade , the use of the term escalated to 2,514 times in the nation \'s `` newspaper of record \'\' . The German term and concept were coined by the influential Ernst Gennat , who described Peter K\\u00fcrten as a Serienm\\u00f6rder ( literally `` serial murderer \'\' ) in his article `` Die D\\u00fcsseldorfer Sexualverbrechen \'\' ( 1930 ) . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the specific term `` serial killer \'\' first arose abroad in a 1960s German film article written by Siegfried Kracauer about the film M ( 1931 ) , a German expressionist film about a pedophilic Serienm\\u00f6rder .   Characteristics   General   Some commonly found characteristics of serial killers include the following :  * They may exhibit varying degrees of mental illness and/or psychopathy , which may contribute to their homicidal behavior .  * * For example , someone who is mentally ill may have psychotic breaks that cause them to believe they are another person or are compelled to murder by other entities .  * * Psychopathic behavior that is consistent with traits common to some serial killers include sensation seeking , a lack of remorse or guilt , impulsivity , the need for control , and predatory behavior .

The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , for example , defines serial killing as `` a series of two or more murders , committed as separate events , usually , but not always , by one offender acting alone \'\' .   Although psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing , and most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim , the FBI states that the motives of serial killers can include anger , thrillseeking , financial gain , and attention seeking . The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion , and the victims may have something in common : age group , appearance , gender , or race , for example .   Serial killing is not the same as mass murdering ( killing numerous people in a given incident ) ; nor is it spree killing ( in which murders are committed in two or more locations , in a short time ) . However , cases of extended bouts of sequential killings over periods of weeks or months with no apparent `` cooling off period \'\' or `` return to normalcy \'\' have caused some experts to suggest a hybrid category of `` spree-serial killer \'\' .   Etymology   The English term and concept of `` serial killer \'\' are commonly attributed to former FBI Special agent Robert Ressler in 1974 . Author Ann Rule postulates in her book Kiss Me , Kill Me ( 2004 ) that the English-language credit for coining the term serial killer goes to LAPD detective Pierce Brooks , who created the ViCAP system in 1985 . Subsequently , throughout the 1980s , the term was used in the pages of the New York Times on 233 occasions , but by the end of the 1990s , in the publication \'s second decade , the use of the term escalated to 2,514 times in the nation \'s `` newspaper of record \'\' . The German term and concept were coined by the influential Ernst Gennat , who described Peter K\\u00fcrten as a Serienm\\u00f6rder ( literally `` serial murderer \'\' ) in his article `` Die D\\u00fcsseldorfer Sexualverbrechen \'\' ( 1930 ) . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the specific term `` serial killer \'\' first arose abroad in a 1960s German film article written by Siegfried Kracauer about the film M ( 1931 ) , a German expressionist film about a pedophilic Serienm\\u00f6rder .   Characteristics   General   Some commonly found characteristics of serial killers include the following :  * They may exhibit varying degrees of mental illness and/or psychopathy , which may contribute to their homicidal behavior . Unlike people with major mental disorders such as schizophrenia , psychopaths can seem normal and often quite charming , a state of adaptation that psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley called the `` mask of sanity \'\' .  * They were often abused\\u2014emotionally , physically and/or sexually\\u2014by a family member .", "question": "which serial killer hanged himself in wakefield prison in january 2004, four years after being found guilty of 15 murders?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "charles d. hirsch", "modAnswer": "harry kane", "delete sentence number": [" However , in his book Serial Killers : The Method and Madness of Monsters ( 2004 ) , criminal justice historian Peter Vronsky argues that while Ressler might have coined the term serial homicide within law , at Bramshill Police Academy in Britain , the terms serial murder and serial murderer appear in John Brophy \'s book The Meaning of Murder ( 1966 ) .", " In his more recent study , Vronsky states that the term `` serial killing \'\' first entered into American popular usage when published in the New York Times in the spring of 1981 , to describe Atlanta serial killer Wayne Williams .", "  * * For example , someone who is mentally ill may have psychotic breaks that cause them to believe they are another person or are compelled to murder by other entities .", "  * * Psychopathic behavior that is consistent with traits common to some serial killers include sensation seeking , a lack of remorse or guilt , impulsivity , the need for control , and predatory behavior ."], "distance value": [[8, 0.5251196622848511], [0, 0.5220033526420593], [9, 0.5147687792778015], [7, 0.47340747714042664], [2, 0.45634233951568604], [1, 0.4446065425872803], [10, 0.4291309416294098], [13, 0.42038556933403015], [5, 0.4173436760902405], [14, 0.4007897973060608], [6, 0.35915321111679077], [3, 0.3417598605155945], [16, 0.32355302572250366], [4, 0.3232894539833069], [15, 0.2895292043685913], [12, 0.2142631560564041], [18, 0.18515998125076294], [17, 0.09893219918012619], [11, 0.08642151951789856]]}\n', '{"test case number": 689, "context": "David ( ; ; ISO 259-3 Dawid ; ; ) was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah , reigning c.1010-970 BCE .

It connects St James \'s Street to Trafalgar Square and is a section of the regional A4 road . The street \'s name is derived from `` pall-mall \'\' , a ball game played there during the 17th century .   The area was built up during the reign of Charles II with fashionable London residences . It became known for high-class shopping in the 18th century , and gentlemen \'s clubs in the 19th . The Reform , Athenaeum and Travellers Clubs have survived to the 21st century . The War Office was based on Pall Mall during the second half of the 19th century , and the Royal Automobile Club \'s headquarters have been on the street since 1908 .   Geography   The street is around long and runs east in the St James \'s area , from St James \'s Street across Waterloo Place , to the Haymarket and continues as Pall Mall East towards Trafalgar Square . The street numbers run consecutively from north-side east to west and then continue on the south-side west to east . It is part of the A4 , a major road running west from Central London . London Bus Route 9 runs westwards along Pall Mall , connecting Trafalgar Square to Piccadilly and Hyde Park Corner .   History and topography   Early history and pall-mall field   Pall Mall was constructed in 1661 , replacing an earlier highway slightly to the south that ran from the Haymarket ( approximately where Warwick House Street is now ) to the royal residence , St James \'s Palace . Historical research suggests a road had been in this location since Saxon times , although the earliest documentary references are from the 12th century in connection with a leper colony at St James \'s Hospital . When St. James \'s Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century , the park \'s boundary wall was built along the south side of the road . In 1620 , the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality .   Pall-mall , a ball game similar to croquet , was introduced to England in the early-17th century by James I . The game , already popular in France and Scotland , was enjoyed by James \' sons Henry and Charles . In 1630 , St James \'s Field , London \'s first pall-mall court , was laid out to the north of the Haymarket \\u2013 St James road .   After the Restoration and King Charles II \'s return to London on 29 May 1660 , a pall-mall court was constructed in St James \'s Park just south of the wall , on the site of The Mall . Samuel Pepys \'s diary entry for 2 April 1661 records that he `` ... went into St. James \'s Park , where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele , the first time that I ever saw the sport . \'\' This new court suffered from dust blown over the wall from coaches travelling along the highway . In July 1661 posts and rails were erected , stopping up the old road . The court for pall-mall was very long and narrow , and often known as an alley , so the old court provided a suitable route for relocating the eastern approach to St James \'s Palace . A grant was made to Dan O\'Neale , Groom of the Bedchamber , and John Denham , Surveyor of the King \'s Works allocating a 1400 by area of land for this purpose . The grant was endorsed `` Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James \'s . \'\'   A new road was built on the site of the old pall-mall court , and opened in September 1661 . It was named Catherine Street , after Catherine of Braganza , wife of Charles II , but was better known as Pall Mall Street or the Old Pall Mall . The pall-mall field was a popular place for recreation and Pepys records several other visits . By July 1665 Pepys used `` Pell Mell \'\' to refer to the street as well as the game .   17th- and 18th-century buildings   In 1662 , Pall Mall was one of several streets `` thought fitt immediately to be repaired , new paved or otherwise amended \'\' under the Streets , London and Westminster Act 1662 .

The street \'s name is derived from `` pall-mall \'\' , a ball game played there during the 17th century .   The area was built up during the reign of Charles II with fashionable London residences . The War Office was based on Pall Mall during the second half of the 19th century , and the Royal Automobile Club \'s headquarters have been on the street since 1908 .   Geography   The street is around long and runs east in the St James \'s area , from St James \'s Street across Waterloo Place , to the Haymarket and continues as Pall Mall East towards Trafalgar Square . It is part of the A4 , a major road running west from Central London . London Bus Route 9 runs westwards along Pall Mall , connecting Trafalgar Square to Piccadilly and Hyde Park Corner .   History and topography   Early history and pall-mall field   Pall Mall was constructed in 1661 , replacing an earlier highway slightly to the south that ran from the Haymarket ( approximately where Warwick House Street is now ) to the royal residence , St James \'s Palace . Historical research suggests a road had been in this location since Saxon times , although the earliest documentary references are from the 12th century in connection with a leper colony at St James \'s Hospital . James \'s Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century , the park \'s boundary wall was built along the south side of the road . In 1620 , the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality .   Pall-mall , a ball game similar to croquet , was introduced to England in the early-17th century by James I . The game , already popular in France and Scotland , was enjoyed by James \' sons Henry and Charles . In 1630 , St James \'s Field , London \'s first pall-mall court , was laid out to the north of the Haymarket \\u2013 St James road .   After the Restoration and King Charles II \'s return to London on 29 May 1660 , a pall-mall court was constructed in St James \'s Park just south of the wall , on the site of The Mall . Samuel Pepys \'s diary entry for 2 April 1661 records that he `` . James \'s Park , where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele , the first time that I ever saw the sport . In July 1661 posts and rails were erected , stopping up the old road . The court for pall-mall was very long and narrow , and often known as an alley , so the old court provided a suitable route for relocating the eastern approach to St James \'s Palace . A grant was made to Dan O\'Neale , Groom of the Bedchamber , and John Denham , Surveyor of the King \'s Works allocating a 1400 by area of land for this purpose . The grant was endorsed `` Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James \'s . \'\'   A new road was built on the site of the old pall-mall court , and opened in September 1661 . It was named Catherine Street , after Catherine of Braganza , wife of Charles II , but was better known as Pall Mall Street or the Old Pall Mall . The pall-mall field was a popular place for recreation and Pepys records several other visits . By July 1665 Pepys used `` Pell Mell \'\' to refer to the street as well as the game .   17th- and 18th-century buildings   In 1662 , Pall Mall was one of several streets `` thought fitt immediately to be repaired , new paved or otherwise amended \'\' under the Streets , London and Westminster Act 1662 .", "question": "what building in pall mall, commissioned by henry viii around 1532, is the administrative centre of the british monarchy?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "the palace", "modAnswer": "the war office", "delete sentence number": [" It became known for high-class shopping in the 18th century , and gentlemen \'s clubs in the 19th .", " The Reform , Athenaeum and Travellers Clubs have survived to the 21st century .", " The street numbers run consecutively from north-side east to west and then continue on the south-side west to east .", " When St.", ".", ".", " went into St.", " \'\' This new court suffered from dust blown over the wall from coaches travelling along the highway ."], "distance value": [[19, 0.6770390272140503], [11, 0.6729212999343872], [0, 0.6554577946662903], [6, 0.6080166697502136], [3, 0.5980879068374634], [16, 0.5477257966995239], [18, 0.5408340692520142], [27, 0.519766092300415], [31, 0.5193070769309998], [34, 0.4982735812664032], [14, 0.47331860661506653], [30, 0.4722125828266144], [12, 0.45742717385292053], [15, 0.44298291206359863], [2, 0.43909916281700134], [32, 0.42073702812194824], [7, 0.4022853374481201], [10, 0.382103830575943], [9, 0.37036389112472534], [1, 0.35945066809654236], [17, 0.35781240463256836], [28, 0.34840691089630127], [24, 0.33615756034851074], [20, 0.3089217245578766], [26, 0.2783266603946686], [33, 0.2730778455734253], [29, 0.26760202646255493], [25, 0.22382710874080658], [5, 0.2210923731327057], [4, 0.21445274353027344], [23, 0.12711338698863983], [13, 0.08158458769321442], [21, 0.07446356862783432], [22, 0.07446356862783432], [8, 0.037643950432538986]]}\n', '{"test case number": 715, "context": "Sasquatch !

More than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history . Over 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians died as a result of the war ( including the victims of a number of genocides ) , a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents \' technological and industrial sophistication , and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare . It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history , and paved the way for major political changes , including revolutions in many of the nations involved .   The war drew in all the world \'s economic great powers , assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the British Empire , France and the Russian Empire ) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary . Although Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary , it did not join the Central Powers , as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive , against the terms of the alliance . These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , while the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers .   The trigger for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 . This set off a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia , and entangled international alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked . Within weeks , the major powers were at war and the conflict soon spread around the world .   On 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia .

More than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history . Over 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians died as a result of the war ( including the victims of a number of genocides ) , a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents \' technological and industrial sophistication , and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare . It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history , and paved the way for major political changes , including revolutions in many of the nations involved .   The war drew in all the world \'s economic great powers , assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the British Empire , France and the Russian Empire ) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary . These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , while the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers .

Byzas consulted the oracle of Apollo at Delphi , which instructed Byzas to settle opposite the `` Land of the Blind \'\' .

The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens , and the prosecution of war against another state . The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society , including , the promotion of a political agenda , protecting corporate economic interests , internal population control , construction , emergency services , social ceremonies , and guarding important areas . The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society , through the development of separate infrastructures , which may include housing , schools , utilities , food production and banking .   The profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself . Some of the most enduring images of the classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders . The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC was one of the defining points of Pharaoh Ramesses II \'s reign and is celebrated in bas-relief on his monuments . A thousand years later the first emperor of unified China , Qin Shi Huang , was so determined to impress the gods with his military might that he was buried with an army of terracotta soldiers . The Romans were dedicated to military matters , leaving to posterity many treatises and writings as well as a large number of lavishly carved triumphal arches and victory columns .   Etymology and definitions   Issue : Possibly cognate with Thousand , cf . Latin and Romance language root word `` mil- \'\' )  The first recorded use of the word military in English , spelled militarie , was in 1585 . It comes from the Latin militaris ( from Latin miles meaning `` soldier \'\' ) but is of uncertain etymology , one suggestion being derived from * mil-it- \\u2013 going in a body or mass . The word is now identified as denoting someone that is skilled in use of weapons , or engaged in military service or in warfare .   As a noun the military usually refers generally to a country \'s armed forces or sometimes , more specifically , to the senior officers who command them . In general it refers to the physicality of armed forces , their personnel , equipment , and physical area which they occupy .   As an adjective military originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering , but it soon broadened to apply to land forces in general and anything to do with their profession . The names of both the Royal Military Academy ( 1741 ) and United States Military Academy ( 1802 ) reflect this . However , at about the time of the Napoleonic Wars , `` military \'\' began to be used in reference to armed forces as a whole and in the 21st century expressions like `` military service \'\' , `` military intelligence \'\' and `` military history \'\' encompass naval , marine and air force aspects . As such , it now connotes any activity performed by armed force personnel .   History   Military history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts , not just the history of the state militaries . It differs somewhat from the history of war with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology , governments , and geography .   Military history has a number of purposes . One main purpose is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes so as to more effectively wage war in the future . Another is to create a sense of military tradition which is used to create cohesive military forces . Still another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively . Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and oral history of military conflicts ( war ) , their participating armies and navies and , more recently , air forces .   There are two types of military history , although almost all texts have elements of both : descriptive history that serves to chronicle conflicts without offering any statements about the causes , nature of conduct , the ending and effects of a conflict ; and analytical history that seeks to offer statements about the causes , nature , ending and aftermath of conflicts as a means of deriving knowledge and understanding of conflicts", "modContext": "The military , also called the armed forces , are forces authorized to use deadly force , and weapons , to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens . The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens , and the prosecution of war against another state . The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society , including , the promotion of a political agenda , protecting corporate economic interests , internal population control , construction , emergency services , social ceremonies , and guarding important areas .   The profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself . Some of the most enduring images of the classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders . Latin and Romance language root word `` mil- \'\' )  The first recorded use of the word military in English , spelled militarie , was in 1585 . It comes from the Latin militaris ( from Latin miles meaning `` soldier \'\' ) but is of uncertain etymology , one suggestion being derived from * mil-it- \\u2013 going in a body or mass . The word is now identified as denoting someone that is skilled in use of weapons , or engaged in military service or in warfare .   As a noun the military usually refers generally to a country \'s armed forces or sometimes , more specifically , to the senior officers who command them .   As an adjective military originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering , but it soon broadened to apply to land forces in general and anything to do with their profession . The names of both the Royal Military Academy ( 1741 ) and United States Military Academy ( 1802 ) reflect this . However , at about the time of the Napoleonic Wars , `` military \'\' began to be used in reference to armed forces as a whole and in the 21st century expressions like `` military service \'\' , `` military intelligence \'\' and `` military history \'\' encompass naval , marine and air force aspects . As such , it now connotes any activity performed by armed force personnel .   History   Military history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts , not just the history of the state militaries . It differs somewhat from the history of war with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology , governments , and geography .   Military history has a number of purposes . One main purpose is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes so as to more effectively wage war in the future . Another is to create a sense of military tradition which is used to create cohesive military forces . Still another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively .

Margaret spent much of her childhood years in the company of her older sister and parents . Her life changed dramatically in 1936 , when her paternal uncle , King Edward VIII , abdicated to marry the twice divorced American Wallis Simpson . Margaret \'s father became King , and her older sister became heir presumptive , with Margaret second in line to the throne . During World War II , the two sisters stayed at Windsor Castle , despite suggestions to evacuate them to Canada . During the war years , Margaret was considered too young to perform any official duties , and instead continued her education .   After the war , Margaret fell in love with Group Captain Peter Townsend . In 1952 , Margaret \'s father died , her sister became sovereign , and Townsend divorced his first wife . Early the following year , he proposed to Margaret . Many in the government felt that he would be an unsuitable husband for the Queen \'s 22-year-old sister , and the Church of England refused to countenance a marriage to a divorced man . Margaret eventually abandoned her plans with him . In 1960 , she accepted the proposal of the photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones , who was created Earl of Snowdon by the Queen . The couple had two children ; they later divorced in 1978 .   Margaret was often viewed as a controversial member of the royal family . Her divorce earned her negative publicity , and she was romantically associated with several men . Her health gradually deteriorated in the final two decades of her life . A heavy smoker for most of her adult life , she had a lung operation in 1985 , a bout of pneumonia in 1993 , and at least three strokes between 1998 and 2001 . She died at King Edward VII Hospital on 9 February 2002 .   Early life   Margaret was born Her Royal Highness Princess Margaret Rose of York on 21 August 1930 at Glamis Castle in Scotland , her mother \'s ancestral home , and was affectionately known as \\u2018 Margot \\u2019 within the royal family . The Home Secretary , J. R. Clynes , was present to verify the birth . The registration of her birth was delayed for several days to avoid her being numbered 13 in the parish register . At the time of her birth , she was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne . Her father was Prince Albert , Duke of York ( later George VI ) , the second son of King George V and Queen Mary . As a grandchild of the Sovereign in the male line , Margaret Rose was styled Her Royal Highness from birth . Her mother was Elizabeth , Duchess of York , the youngest daughter of the 14th Earl and the Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne . The Duchess of York originally wanted the names Ann Margaret , as she explained to Queen Mary in a letter : `` I am very anxious to call her Ann Margaret , as I think Ann of York sounds pretty , & Elizabeth and Ann go so well together . \'\' King George V disliked the name Ann , but approved of the alternative `` Margaret Rose \'\' . She was baptised in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 30 October 1930 by Cosmo Lang , the Archbishop of Canterbury .

Margaret spent much of her childhood years in the company of her older sister and parents . Her life changed dramatically in 1936 , when her paternal uncle , King Edward VIII , abdicated to marry the twice divorced American Wallis Simpson . Margaret \'s father became King , and her older sister became heir presumptive , with Margaret second in line to the throne . During World War II , the two sisters stayed at Windsor Castle , despite suggestions to evacuate them to Canada . During the war years , Margaret was considered too young to perform any official duties , and instead continued her education .   After the war , Margaret fell in love with Group Captain Peter Townsend . In 1952 , Margaret \'s father died , her sister became sovereign , and Townsend divorced his first wife . Early the following year , he proposed to Margaret . Many in the government felt that he would be an unsuitable husband for the Queen \'s 22-year-old sister , and the Church of England refused to countenance a marriage to a divorced man . Margaret eventually abandoned her plans with him . The couple had two children ; they later divorced in 1978 . A heavy smoker for most of her adult life , she had a lung operation in 1985 , a bout of pneumonia in 1993 , and at least three strokes between 1998 and 2001 . She died at King Edward VII Hospital on 9 February 2002 . Clynes , was present to verify the birth . The registration of her birth was delayed for several days to avoid her being numbered 13 in the parish register .

Her father was Prince Albert , Duke of York ( later George VI ) , the second son of King George V and Queen Mary . As a grandchild of the Sovereign in the male line , Margaret Rose was styled Her Royal Highness from birth . Her mother was Elizabeth , Duchess of York , the youngest daughter of the 14th Earl and the Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne . The Duchess of York originally wanted the names Ann Margaret , as she explained to Queen Mary in a letter : `` I am very anxious to call her Ann Margaret , as I think Ann of York sounds pretty , & Elizabeth and Ann go so well together . \'\' King George V disliked the name Ann , but approved of the alternative `` Margaret Rose \'\' . She was baptised in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 30 October 1930 by Cosmo Lang , the Archbishop of Canterbury . Her godparents were : the Prince of Wales ( her paternal uncle , for whom his brother the Prince George stood proxy ) ; the Princess Victoria ( her paternal great-aunt ) ; the Lady Rose Leveson-Gower ( her maternal aunt ) ; and the Hon David Bowes-Lyon ( her maternal uncle ) .
