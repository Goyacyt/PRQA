[{'test case number': 0, 'context': "White is an achromatic color , a color without hue . An incoming light to the human eye that stimulates all its three types of color sensitive cone cells in nearly equal amounts results in white . White is one of the most common colors in nature , the color of sunlight , snow , milk , chalk , limestone and other common minerals . In many cultures white represents or signifies purity , innocence , and light , and is the symbolic opposite of black , or darkness . According to surveys in Europe and the United States , white is the color most often associated with perfection , the good , honesty , cleanliness , the beginning , the new , neutrality , and exactitude .   In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome , priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity , and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity , and a white lamb sacrifice and purity ; the widows of kings dressed in white rather than black as the color of mourning . It sometimes symbolizes royalty ; it was the color of the French kings ( black being the color of the queens ) and of the monarchist movement after the French Revolution as well as of the movement called the White Russians ( not to be confounded with Belarus , literally `` White Russia '' ) who fought the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War ( 1917–1922 ) . Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble , and beginning in the 18th century , with the advent of neoclassical architecture , white became the most common color of new churches , capitols and other government buildings , especially in the United States . It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity , simplicity and strength .   White is an important color for almost all world religions . The Pope , the head of the Roman Catholic Church , has worn white since 1566 , as a symbol of purity and sacrifice . In Islam , and in the Shinto religion of Japan , it is worn by pilgrims ; and by the Brahmins in India . In Western cultures and in Japan , white is the most common color for wedding dresses , symbolizing purity and virginity . In many Asian cultures , white is also the color of mourning .   The white color on television screens and computer monitors is created with the RGB color model by mixing red , green and blue light at equal intensities .

He was born in Woodland Plantation near La Place , Louisiana .   Biography   Ory started playing music with home-made instruments in his childhood , and by his teens was leading a well-regarded band in Southeast Louisiana . He kept La Place , Louisiana , as his base of operations due to family obligations until his twenty-first birthday , when he moved his band to New Orleans , Louisiana . He was one of the most influential trombonists of early jazz .   Ory was a banjo player during his youth and it is said that his ability to play the banjo helped him develop `` tailgate '' , a particular style of playing the trombone . In `` tailgate '' style the trombone plays a rhythmic line underneath the trumpets and cornets .   While Ory was living on Jackson Avenue , he was discovered by Buddy Bolden , playing his first New trombone , instead of the old civil war trombone . But his sister said he was too young to play with Bolden .   Ory had one of the best-known bands in New Orleans in the 1910s , hiring many of the great jazz musicians of the city , including cornetists Joe `` King '' Oliver , Mutt Carey , and Louis Armstrong , who joined the band in 1919 ; and clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone .   In 1919 he moved to Los Angeles—one of a number of New Orleans musicians to do so near that time—and he recorded there in 1921 with a band that included Mutt Carey , clarinetist and pianist Dink Johnson , and string bassist Ed Garland . Garland and Carey were longtime associates who would still be playing with Ory during his 1940s comeback . While in Los Angeles Ory and his band recorded two instrumentals , `` Ory 's Creole Trombone '' and `` Society Blues '' , as well as a number of songs . They were the first jazz recordings made on the west coast by an African-American jazz band from New Orleans . His band recorded with the recording company Nordskog and Ory paid them for the pressings and then sold them under his own label of `` Kid Ory 's Sunshine Orchestra '' at a store in Los Angeles called Spikes Brothers Music Store . In 1925 , Ory moved to Chicago , where he was very active , working and recording with Louis Armstrong , Jelly Roll Morton , Oliver , Johnny Dodds , Bessie Smith , Ma Rainey , and many others . He mentored Benny Goodman , and later Charles Mingus .   During the Great Depression Ory retired from music and did not play again until 1943 . From 1944 to about 1961 he led one of the top New Orleans style bands of the period . In addition to Mutt Carey and Ed Garland , trumpeters Alvin Alcorn and Teddy Buckner ; clarinetists Darnell Howard , Jimmie Noone , Albert Nicholas , Barney Bigard , and George Probert ; pianists Buster Wilson , Cedric Haywood , and Don Ewell ; and drummer Minor Hall were among his sidemen during this period . All but Probert , Buckner , and Ewell were originally from New Orleans .   The Ory band was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz , making popular 1940s radio broadcasts—among them a number of slots on The Orson Welles Almanac program ( beginning March 15 , 1944 ) . In 1944–45 the group made a series of recordings on the Crescent Records label , founded by Nesuhi Ertegun for the express purpose of recording Ory 's band .   During the late 1940s and early 1950s , Ory and his group appeared at the Beverly Cavern in Los Angeles .   Ory retired from music in 1966 and spent his last years in Hawaii , with the assistance of Trummy Young . Ory died in Honolulu . He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City , California .

The Tempest   Prospero is the rightful Duke of Milan , whose usurping brother , Antonio , had put him ( with his then three-year old daughter , Miranda ) to sea on `` a rotten carcass of a butt [ boat ] '' to die , 12 years before the play begins . Prospero and Miranda survived and found exile on a small island . He has learned sorcery from books , and uses it while on the island to protect Miranda and control the other characters . Before the play has begun , Prospero frees Ariel from entrapment within `` a cloven pine '' , about which Prospero states :   Prospero 's sorcery is sufficiently powerful to control Ariel and other spirits , as well as to alter weather and even raise the dead : `` Graves at my command have waked their sleepers , oped , and let 'em forth , by my so potent Art . `` - Act V , scene 1 .   On the island , Prospero becomes master of the monster Caliban ( the son of Sycorax , a malevolent witch ) and forces Caliban into submission by punishing him with magic if he does not obey . Ariel is beholden to Prospero after he is freed from his imprisonment inside the pine tree .   At the end of the play , Prospero intends to drown his book and renounce magic . In the view of the audience , this may have been required to make the ending unambiguously happy , as magic was associated with diabolical works ; he will drown his books for the same reason that Doctor Faust , in an earlier play by Christopher Marlowe , promised in vain to burn his books .   Prospero 's speech   The final soliloquy and epilogue in The Tempest is considered to be one of the most memorable speeches in Shakespearean literature .   Now my charms are all o'erthrown ,  And what strength I have 's mine own ,  Which is most faint : now , 't is true ,  I must be here confined by you ,  Or sent to Naples . Let me not ,  Since I have my dukedom got  And pardon 'd the deceiver , dwell  In this bare island by your spell ;  But release me from my bands  With the help of your good hands :  Gentle breath of yours my sails  Must fill , or else my project fails ,  Which was to please . Now I want  Spirits to enforce , art to enchant ,  And my ending is despair ,  Unless I be relieved by prayer ,  Which pierces so that it assaults  Mercy itself and frees all faults .  As you from crimes would pardon 'd be ,  Let your indulgence set me free .   In it , Prospero states his loss ( magic ) and his continuing imprisonment if the audience is not pleased .

Doctor Who . He is portrayed by Colin Baker . Although his televisual time on the series was comparatively brief and turbulent , Baker has continued as the Sixth Doctor in Big Finish 's range of original Doctor Who audio adventures . Within the series ' narrative , the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS , frequently with companions . When the Doctor is critically injured , he can regenerate his body ; in doing so , his physical appearance and personality change . Baker portrays the sixth such incarnation , a flamboyant man in brightly coloured , mismatched clothes whose brash and overbearing personality set him apart from all his previous incarnations .   The Sixth Doctor appeared in three seasons . His appearance in the first of these was at the end of the final episode of The Caves of Androzani which featured the regeneration from the Fifth Doctor and thereafter in the following serial The Twin Dilemma , the end of that season . The Sixth Doctor 's era was marked by the decision of the BBC controller Michael Grade to put the series on an 18-month `` hiatus '' between seasons 22 and 23 , with only one new Doctor Who story , Slipback , made on radio during the hiatus , broadcast as 6 parts ( at 10 minutes each ) on BBC Radio 4 from 25 July to 8 August 1985 , as part of a children 's magazine show called Pirate Radio Four . Colin Baker had been signed up for four years , as the previous actor Peter Davison had left after only three years .   Prior to its postponement , season 23 was well advanced with episodes already drafted and in at least one case distributed to cast and production . Alongside `` The Nightmare Fair '' , The Ultimate Evil '' , `` Mission to Magnus '' , `` Yellow Fever and How to Cure It '' , the remaining stories were still under development in a 25-minute episode format after the season was postponed . These were all dropped with the reconception of the season in mid 1985 in favour of a 14 episode story arc called The Trial of a Time Lord . The Sixth Doctor also appeared in the special Dimensions in Time .

At least two works qualified as pre-Dadaist , a posteriori , had already sensitized the public and artists alike : Ubu Roi ( 1896 ) by Alfred Jarry , and the ballet Parade ( 1916–17 ) by Erik Satie . The roots of Dada lay in pre-war avant-garde . Cubism and the development of collage , combined with Wassily Kandinsky 's theoretical writings and abstraction , detached the movement from the constraints of reality and convention . The influence of French poets and the writings of German Expressionists liberated Dada from the tight correlation between words and meaning . Avant-garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments . They had seen ( or participated in ) Cubist exhibitions held at Galería Dalmau , Barcelona ( 1912 ) , Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin ( 1912 ) , the Armory show in New York ( 1913 ) , SVU Mánes in Prague ( 1914 ) , several Jack of Diamonds exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring , Amsterdam ( between 1911 and 1915 ) . Futurism developed in response to the work of various artists . Dada subsequently combined these approaches .   Dada activities included public gatherings , demonstrations , and publication of art/literary journals ; passionate coverage of art , politics , and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media . Key figures in the movement included Hugo Ball , Emmy Hennings , Hans Arp , Raoul Hausmann , Hannah Höch , Johannes Baader , Tristan Tzara , Francis Picabia , Richard Huelsenbeck , George Grosz , John Heartfield , Marcel Duchamp , Beatrice Wood , Kurt Schwitters , Hans Richter , and Max Ernst , among others . The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements , and groups including surrealism , Nouveau Réalisme , pop art and Fluxus .   Overview   Dada was an informal international movement , with participants in Europe and North America . The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I . For many participants , the movement was a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests , which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war , and against the cultural and intellectual conformity—in art and more broadly in society—that corresponded to the war .   Many Dadaists believed that the 'reason ' and 'logic ' of bourgeois capitalist society had led people into war . They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace chaos and irrationality . For example , George Grosz later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest `` against this world of mutual destruction . ''   According to Hans Richter Dada was not art : it was `` anti-art . '' Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for . Where art was concerned with traditional aesthetics , Dada ignored aesthetics . If art was to appeal to sensibilities , Dada was intended to offend .   As Hugo Ball expressed it , `` For us , art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in . ''   A reviewer from the American Art News stated at the time that `` Dada philosophy is the sickest , most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man . '' Art historians have described Dada as being , in large part , a `` reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide . ''   Years later , Dada artists described the movement as `` a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis , a savior , a monster , which would lay waste to everything in its path ... [ It was ] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization ... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege .

As Prime Minister , he oversaw landmark changes including the decision not to devalue the Australian dollar in line with the British pound , and the 1967 constitutional referendum in which an overwhelming majority of Australians voted in favour of giving the Commonwealth power to legislate specifically for indigenous Australians . He controversially expanded Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War , with the slogan `` All the way with LBJ '' .   Early life   Born in Stanmore , New South Wales on 5 August 1908 , Holt was the elder son of Thomas and Olive ( née Williams ) . He and his brother Cliff ( Clifford Thomas Holt , born 1910 ) , spent their early life in Sydney , attending three different schools . In 1918 , Thomas Holt divorced Olive and went to work with the Hugh D. McIntosh , manager of the Tivoli theatre circuit . He later became the Tivoli-J C Williamson representative in London and New York . Meanwhile , he enrolled his sons as boarders at Wesley College in Melbourne .   In 1924 , when Holt was sixteen , his mother died and he did not attend her funeral . A formative event was his singing performance at his school 's annual Speech Night in December 1926 . None of his family were present , and he never forgot the loneliness he felt that night .   Holt won a scholarship to Queen 's College at the University of Melbourne and began his law degree in 1927 . He excelled in many areas of university life – he won College 'Blues ' for cricket and Australian rules football , as well as the College Oratory and Essay Prize . A member of the Melbourne Inter-University Debating team and the United Australia Organization ' A ' Grade debating team , he was president of both the Sports and Social Club and the Law Students ' Society .   Holt graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1930 . He was admitted to the Victorian Bar in November 1932 and served his articles with the Melbourne firm of Fink , Best & Miller , but the Great Depression meant that he was unable to find work as a barrister . His father , based in London at the time , wanted him to further his studies in England , but the worsening economy also made this impossible . Instead , in 1933 , Holt went into sole practice as a solicitor . He later entered into a partnership , which became the firm of Holt , Graham & Newman , which Holt remained with until 1963 .

History   Founding by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés   Founded in 1565 by the Spanish conquistador , Pedro Menéndez de Avilés , St. Augustine is the oldest continuously occupied settlement of European origin in the United States . In 1562 , a group of French Protestants known as Huguenots , led by Jean Ribault , arrived in Spanish Florida to establish a colony in the territory claimed by Spain . They explored the mouth of the St. Johns River , calling it la Rivière de Mai ( the River May ) , then sailed northward and established a settlement called Charlesfort at Port Royal Sound in present-day South Carolina . Spain learned of this French expedition through its spies at ports on the Atlantic coast of France . The Huguenot nobleman René de Laudonnière , who had participated in the expedition , returned to Florida in 1564 with three ships and 300 Huguenot colonists . He arrived at the mouth of the River May on June 22 , 1564 , sailed up it a few miles , and founded Fort Caroline .   Desiring to protect its claimed territories in North America against such incursions , the Spanish Crown issued an asiento to Menéndez , signed by King Philip II on March 20 , 1565 , granting him expansive trade privileges , the power to distribute lands , licenses to sell 500 slaves , as well as various titles , including that of adelantado of Florida . This contract directed Menéndez to sail for La Florida , reconnoitre it from the Florida Keys to present-day Canada , and report on its coastal features , with a view to establishing a permanent colony for the defense of the Spanish treasure fleet . He was ordered as well to drive away any intruders who were not subjects of the Spanish crown .   On July 28 , Menéndez set sail from Cádiz with a fleet led by his 600-ton flagship , the San Pelayo , accompanied by several smaller ships , and carrying over 1,000 sailors , soldiers , and settlers . On the feast day of St. Augustine , August 28 , the fleet sighted land and anchored off the north inlet of the tidal channel the French called the River of Dolphins . Menéndez then sailed north and confronted Ribault 's fleet outside the bar of the River May in a brief skirmish . On September 6 , he returned to the site of his first landfall , naming it after the Catholic saint , disembarked his troops , and quickly constructed fortifications to protect his people and supplies .   Menéndez then marched his soldiers overland for a surprise attack on Fort Caroline , where they killed almost everyone in the fort except for the women and children . Jean Ribault had already put out to sea with his ships for an assault on St. Augustine , but was surprised by a storm that wrecked his ships further south .

Headquartered in Bologna , Italy , Ducati is owned by German automotive manufacturer Audi through its Italian subsidiary Lamborghini , which is all owned by the Volkswagen Group .   History   In 1926 Antonio Cavalieri Ducati and his three sons , Adriano , Marcello , and Bruno Cavalieri Ducati ; founded Società Scientifica Radio Brevetti Ducati in Bologna to produce vacuum tubes , condensers and other radio components . In 1935 they had become successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city . Production was maintained during World War II , despite the Ducati factory being a repeated target of Allied bombing .   Meanwhile , at the small Turinese firm SIATA ( Societa Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto-Aviatorie ) , Aldo Farinelli began developing a small pushrod engine for mounting on bicycles . Barely a month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944 , SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine , called the `` Cucciolo '' ( Italian for `` puppy , '' in reference to the distinctive exhaust sound ) to the public . The first Cucciolos were available alone , to be mounted on standard bicycles , by the buyer ; however , businessmen soon bought the little engines in quantity , and offered complete motorized-bicycle units for sale .   In 1950 , after more than 200,000 Cucciolos had been sold , in collaboration with SIATA , the Ducati firm finally offered its own Cucciolo-based motorcycle . This first Ducati motorcycle was a 48 cc bike weighing , with a top speed of , and had a 15 mm giving just under . Ducati soon dropped the Cucciolo name in favor of `` 55M '' and `` 65TL '' .   When the market moved toward larger motorcycles , Ducati management decided to respond , making an impression at an early-1952 Milan show , introducing their 65TS cycle and Cruiser ( a four-stroke motor scooter ) . Despite being described as the most interesting new machine at the 1952 show , the Cruiser was not a great success , and only a few thousand were made over a two-year period before the model ceased production .   In 1953 , management split the company into two separate entities , Ducati Meccanica SpA and Ducati Elettronica , in acknowledgment of its diverging motorcycle and electronics product lines . Ducati Elettronica became Ducati Energia SpA in the eighties . Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance . By 1954 , Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day .   In the 1960s , Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250 cc road bike then available , the Mach 1 . In the 1970s Ducati began producing large-displacement V-twin motorcycles and in 1973 , released a V-twin with the trademarked desmodromic valve design . In 1985 , Cagiva bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the `` Cagiva '' name . By the time the purchase was completed , Cagiva kept the `` Ducati '' name on its motorcycles . Eleven years later , in 1996 , Cagiva accepted the offer from Texas Pacific Group and sold a 51 % stake in the company for US $ 325 million ; then , in 1998 , Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49 % to become the sole owner of Ducati . In 1999 , TPG issued an initial public offering of Ducati stock and renamed the company `` Ducati Motor Holding SpA '' . TPG sold over 65 % of its shares in Ducati , leaving TPG the majority shareholder . In December 2005 , Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific 's stake ( minus one share ) to Investindustrial Holdings , the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi .

system of representing the position of chess pieces on a chessboard . Publications such as EG use it to classify endgame types and to index endgame studies .   The code is named after Richard Guy , Hugh Blandford and John Roycroft . The first two devised the original system ( the Guy–Blandford code ) using different figures to represent the number of pieces . Roycroft suggested to count one for a white piece and three for a black piece in order to make the code easier to memorise .   Definition   In the GBR code , every chess position is represented by six digits , in the following format :   abcd.ef   * a = queens  * b = rooks  * c = bishops  * d = knights  * e = white pawns  * f = black pawns   For the first four digits , each white piece counts as 1 , and each black piece counts as 3 . Thus , for example , if White has two knights and Black has one knight , numeral d 1 + 1 + 3  5 . If that is all the material other than the kings , the position is classified 0005 . Values 0 through 8 represent all normal permutations of force ; 9 is used if either side has promoted material .   The last two digits of the code represent the number of white and black pawns , respectively .   Usage   GBR code can be used to refer to a general class of material . For example , the endgame of two knights against pawn ( as famously analysed by A.A. Troitsky , leading to his discovery of the Troitsky line ) , is GBR class 0002.01 .   When indexing or referring to specific positions , rather than generalised material imbalances , the code may be extended in various ways . Two common ones are to prefix `` + '' to indicate the stipulation `` White to play and win '' or `` '' for `` White to play and draw '' ; and to suffix the position of the white and black kings . With these additions , the position to the right , a draw study by Leonid Kubbel ( First Prize , Shakhmaty , 1925 ) , is classified as  0323.12g3g1 .

The book tells the story of a Chinese boy with a long name who fell into a well . It is a sort of origin myth about why Chinese names are so short today . The book is controversial because it appears to retell a Japanese story and because it does not portray Chinese culture accurately .   Plot   Tikki Tikki Tembo is set in ancient China and invents an ancient Chinese custom whereby parents honor their first-born sons with long , elaborate names that everyone is obliged to say completely - no nicknames , no shortening of any kind - while second-born sons are typically given short , unimportant names . A boy named Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo ( `` The Most Wonderful Thing in the Whole Wide World '' ) and his little brother Chang ( `` Little or Nothing '' ) are playing very close to a well at their house that their mother has warned them to avoid . Chang falls in the well and his older brother runs to their mother and tells her Chang has fallen down the well . Their mother tells him to get the Old Man with the Ladder . He goes and tells the old man . Chang is rescued and then recovers quickly . Some time later , the boys are again playing near the well . This time , the older brother falls in . Chang runs to their mother and tries to tell her that `` Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo has fallen into the well . '' At first she can not hear him so he says it again . However , because Chang is out of breath from running he sputters and then mispronounces the name . His mother insists that he repeat the namebut with respect . He tries repeatedly until finally his mother tells Chang to get the Old Man with the Ladder . Chang goes to the Old Man with the Ladder . Initially , the old man does not respond because he is asleep . Further , when Chang tries to wake him up , the Old Man with the Ladderannoyedtries to fall back asleep . After Chang breathlessly repeats his brother 's predicament the Old Man goes with Chang to save his brother from the well . They get Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo from the well , but because of the long time he was in the well , it was many moons before he was quite the same again . The end of the story says that this is why the Chinese have short names .   Reception   The book received accolades upon publication . The Kirkus Review found the illustrations to be `` a skillful counterpoint of diminutive detail and spacious landscape and a fine setting for a sprightly folktale . '' The book won a 1968 Boston Globe–Horn Book Award in the Picture Book category .   In 1997 , The New York Times selected it as one of the 50 best children 's books of the previous 50 years . In a 1999-2000 National Education Association online survey of children , the book was one of the `` Kids ' Top 100 Books '' . Based on a 2007 online poll , the National Education Association named the book one of its `` Teachers ' Top 100 Books for Children '' . In a 2008 online poll of `` Top 100 Picture Books '' by School Library Journal , the book ranked 35th ; in a similar 2012 poll , the book ranked 89th .

It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in Latin American football . The tournament is named in honor of the Libertadores ( Spanish and Portuguese for liberators ) , the main leaders of the South American wars of independence , so a literal translation of its name into English would be `` Liberators of America Cup '' .   The tournament is currently sponsored by Bridgestone and is thus known as the Copa Bridgestone Libertadores . The competition has had several different formats over its lifetime . At the beginning , only the champions of the South American leagues participated . In 1966 , the runners-up of the South American leagues began to join . In 1998 , Mexican teams were invited to compete , and have contested regularly since 2000 , when the tournament was expanded from 20 to 32 teams . Today at least three clubs per country compete in the tournament , while Argentina and Brazil each have five clubs participating . Traditionally , a group stage has always been used but the number of teams per group has varied several times .   In the present format , the tournament consists of six stages , with the first stage taking place in early February . The six surviving teams from the first stage join 26 teams in the second stage , in which there are eight groups consisting of four teams each . The eight group winners and eight runners-up enter the final four stages , better known as the knockout stages , which ends with the finals anywhere between June and August . The winner of the Copa Libertadores becomes eligible to play in the FIFA Club World Cup and the Recopa Sudamericana .   Independiente of Argentina are the most successful club in the cup 's history , having won the tournament seven times . Argentine clubs have accumulated the most victories with 23 wins , while Brazil has the largest number of different winning teams , with a total of 10 clubs having won the title . The cup has been won by 24 different clubs , 13 of which have won the title more than once , and won consecutively by six clubs . The defending champions were Argentine side River Plate , who won their third title after beating Tigres UANL of Mexico .   History   The clashes for the Copa Río de La Plata between the champions of Argentina and Uruguay kindled the idea of a continental competition in the 1930s . In 1948 , the South American Championship of Champions ( ) , the most direct precursor to the Copa Libertadores , was played and organized by Chilean club Colo-Colo after years of planning and organization . Held in Santiago , it brought together the champions of each nation 's top national leagues . The tournament was won by Vasco da Gama of Brazil .   In 1958 , the basis and format of the competition was created by Peñarol 's board leaders . On March 5 , 1959 , at the 24th South American Congress held in Buenos Aires , the competition was approved by the International Affairs Committee . In 1966 , it was named in honor of the heroes of South American liberation , such as José Gervasio Artigas , Bernardo O'Higgins , José de San Martín , Pedro I , and Simón Bolívar , among others .   Beginnings : 1960–1969   The first edition of the Copa Libertadores took place in 1960 .

Various grains ( which may be malted ) are used for different varieties , including barley , corn ( maize ) , rye , and wheat . Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks , generally made of charred white oak .   Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types . The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains , distillation , and aging in wooden barrels .   Etymology   The word whisky ( or whiskey ) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce ( or uisge ) meaning `` water '' ( now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic , and uisge in Scottish Gaelic ) . Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae ( `` water of life '' ) . This was translated to Classical Gaelic as / `` water of life '' . Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe ( 1581 ) , usquebaugh ( 1610 ) , usquebath ( 1621 ) , and usquebae ( 1715 ) .   Names and spellings   Much is made of the word 's two spellings : whisky and whiskey . There are two schools of thought on the issue . One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word , indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer ( like the difference between color and colour ; or recognize and recognise ) , and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described . There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label , the spelling on the label should not be altered . Some writers refer to `` whisk ( e ) y '' or `` whisky/whiskey '' to acknowledge the variation .   The spelling whiskey is common in Ireland and the United States , while whisky is used in all other whisky producing countries . In the US , the usage has not always been consistent . From the late eighteenth century to the mid twentieth century , American writers used both spellings interchangeably until the introduction of newspaper style guides . Since the 1960s , American writers have increasingly used whiskey as the accepted spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and whisky for aged grain spirits made outside the US . However , some prominent American brands , such as George Dickel , Maker 's Mark , and Old Forester ( all made by different companies ) , use the whisky spelling on their labels , and the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits , the legal regulations for spirit in the US , also use the whisky spelling throughout .   `` Scotch '' is the internationally recognized term for `` Scotch whisky '' .   History   It is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC , with perfumes and aromatics being distilled , but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretation of evidence . The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD , but these were not distillations of alcohol . The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks , and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century , but again these were not distillations of alcohol . Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins , with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century.Book [ https : //books.google.com/books ? id  XeqWOkKYn28C & printsecfrontcover A Short History of the Art of Distillation ] , by Robert James Forbes ( year 1948 ) .

Reagan considered appointing Utah Senator Orrin Hatch to the seat , but Congress had approved $ 6,000 pay raises for Supreme Court Justices in February , raising a problem under the Ineligibility Clause of the United States Constitution , which prohibits a member of Congress from accepting an appointment for which the pay had been increased during that member 's term .

An assassination may be prompted by religious , political , or military motives ; it is an act that may be done for financial gain , to avenge a grievance , from a desire to acquire fame or notoriety , or because of a military , security or insurgent group 's command to carry out the homicide .   Etymology   The word assassin is often believed to derive from the word Hashshashin ( Arabic : حشّاشين , ħashshāshīyīn , also Hashishin , Hashashiyyin , or Assassins ) , and shares its etymological roots with hashish ( or ; from Arabic : ' ) . It referred to a group of Nizari Shia Persians who worked against various Arab and Persian targets .   Founded by the Persian Hassan-i Sabbah , the Assassins were active in the fortress of Alamut in Iran from the 8th to the 14th centuries , and also controlled the castle of Masyaf in Syria . The group killed members of the Persian , Abbasid , Seljuq , and Christian Crusader élite for political and religious reasons .   Although it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of hashish during their killings or during their indoctrination , there is debate as to whether these claims have merit , with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name . The earliest known literary use of the word assassination is in Macbeth by William Shakespeare ( 1605 ) .   The word for `` murder '' in many Romance languages is derived from this same root word ( see Spanish asesinato ) .   Use in history   Ancient to medieval times   Assassination is one of the oldest tools of power politics . It dates back at least as far as recorded history .   The Old Testament story of Judith illustrates how a woman frees the Israelites by tricking and assassinating Holofernes , a warlord of the rival Assyrians , with whom the Israelites were at war . King Joash of Judah was recorded as being assassinated by his own servants ; Joab assassinated Absalom , King David 's son ; and King Sennacherib of Assyria was assassinated by his own sons .   Chanakya ( c. 350–283 BC ) wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise Arthashastra . His student Chandragupta Maurya , the founder of the Maurya Empire , later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies , including two of Alexander the Great 's generals , Nicanor and Philip . Other famous victims are Philip II of Macedon ( 336 BC ) , the father of Alexander the Great , and Roman consul Julius Caesar ( 44 BC ) . Emperors of Rome often met their end in this way , as did many of the Muslim Shia Imams hundreds of years later . The practice was also well known in ancient China , as in Jing Ke 's failed assassination of Qin king Ying Zheng in 227 BC . Whilst many assassination were performed by an individual or a small group , there were also specialized units who used a collective group of people to perform more than one assassination . The earliest were the sicarii in 6 A.D. , who predated the Middle Eastern assassins and Japanese ninjas by centuries .   In the Middle Ages , regicide was rare in Western Europe , but it was a recurring theme in the Eastern Roman Empire . Blinding and strangling in the bathtub were the most commonly used procedures . With the Renaissance , tyrannicide—or assassination for personal or political reasons—became more common again in Western Europe . High medieval sources mention the assassination of King Demetrius Zvonimir ( 1089 ) , dying at the hands of his own people , who objected to a proposition by the Pope to go on a campaign to aid the Byzantines against the Seljuk Turks . This account is , however , contentious among historians , it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes . The myth of the `` Curse of King Zvonimir '' is based on the legend of his assassination . In 1192 , Conrad of Montferrat , the de facto King of Jerusalem , was killed by an assassin .

It is situated across a group of 117 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by bridges . These are located in the marshy Venetian Lagoon which stretches along the shoreline , between the mouths of the Po and the Piave Rivers . Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings , their architecture , and artwork . The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site .   In 2009 , 270,098 people resided in Venice 's comune ( the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia ; of whom around 60,000 live in the historic city of Venice ( Centro storico ) ; 176,000 in Terraferma ( the mainland ) , mostly in the large frazioni ( roughly equivalent to `` parishes '' or `` wards '' in other countries ) of Mestre and Marghera ; and 31,000 on other islands in the lagoon ) . Together with Padua and Treviso , the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area ( PATREVE ) , with a total population of 2,600,000 . PATREVE is only a statistical metropolitan area without any degree of autonomy .   The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC . The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice . Venice has been known as the `` La Dominante '' , `` Serenissima '' , `` Queen of the Adriatic '' , `` City of Water '' , `` City of Masks '' , `` City of Bridges '' , `` The Floating City '' , and `` City of Canals '' .   The Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance , and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto , as well as a very important center of commerce ( especially silk , grain , and spice ) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century . This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history . It is also known for its several important artistic movements , especially the Renaissance period . After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna , the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire , until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 , following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence . Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music , and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi .   Etymology   The name of the city , deriving from Latin forms Venetia and Venetiae , is most likely taken from `` Venetia et Histria '' , the Roman name of Regio X of Roman Italy , but applied to the coastal part of the region that remained under Roman Empire outside of Gothic , Lombard , and Frankish control . The name Venetia , however , derives from the Roman name for the people known as the Veneti , and called by the Greeks Eneti ( Ἐνετοί ) . The meaning of the word is uncertain , although there are other Indo-European tribes with similar-sounding names , such as the Celtic Veneti , Baltic Veneti , and the Slavic Wends . Linguists suggest that the name is based on an Indo-European root * wen ( `` love '' ) , so that * wenetoi would mean `` beloved '' , `` lovable '' , or `` friendly '' . A connection with the Latin word venetus , meaning the color 'sea-blue ' , is also possible .  Supposed connections of Venetia with the Latin verb venire ( to come ) , such as Marin Sanudo 's veni etiam ( `` Yet , I have come ! `` ) , the supposed cry of the first refugees to the Venetian lagoon from the mainland , or even with venia ( `` forgiveness '' ) are fanciful . The alternative obsolete form is Vinegia ; ( Venetian : Venèxia ; ; ) .   History   Origins   Although no surviving historical records deal directly with the founding of Venice , tradition and the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original population of Venice consisted of refugees from Roman cities near Venice such as Padua , Aquileia , Treviso , Altino and Concordia ( modern Portogruaro ) and from the undefended countryside , who were fleeing successive waves", 'modContext': ' ;

of the former British Empire . The Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states , organised through the Commonwealth Secretariat , and non-governmental organisations , organised through the Commonwealth Foundation .   The Commonwealth dates back to the mid-20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories . It was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 , which established the member states as `` free and equal '' . The symbol of this free association is Queen Elizabeth II who is the Head of the Commonwealth . The Queen is also the monarch of 16 members of the Commonwealth , known as Commonwealth realms . The other Commonwealth members have different heads of state : 32 members are republics and five are monarchies with a different monarch .   Member states have no legal obligation to one another . Instead , they are united by language , history , culture and their shared values of democracy , human rights , and the rule of law . These values are enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter and promoted by the quadrennial Commonwealth Games . On 3 October 2013 , after 48 years of membership , The Gambia became the most recent nation to withdraw from the Commonwealth .   The Commonwealth covers more than 29958050 km2 , almost a quarter of the world 's land area , and spans all six inhabited continents . With an estimated population of 2.328 billion , nearly a third of the world population , the Commonwealth in 2014 produced a nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ) of $ 10.45 trillion , representing 17 % of the gross world product when measured in purchasing power parity ( PPP ) and 14 % of the gross world product when measured nominally .   History   Origin   Queen Elizabeth II , in her address to Canada on Dominion Day in 1959 , pointed out that the confederation of Canada on 1 July 1867 had been the birth of the `` first independent country within the British Empire '' . She declared : `` So , it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of Nations . '' As long ago as 1884 , however , Lord Rosebery , while visiting Australia , had described the changing British Empire—as some of its colonies became more independent—as a `` Commonwealth of Nations '' . Conferences of British and colonial prime ministers occurred periodically from the first one in 1887 , leading to the creation of the Imperial Conferences in 1911 .   The Commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences . A specific proposal was presented by Jan Smuts in 1917 when he coined the term `` the British Commonwealth of Nations '' and envisioned the `` future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence '' at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 by delegates from the Dominions as well as Britain . The term first received imperial statutory recognition in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 , when the term British Commonwealth of Nations was substituted for British Empire in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the Irish Free State .   Dominions   In the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference , Britain and its dominions agreed they were `` equal in status , in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs , though united by common allegiance to the Crown , and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations . '' These aspects to the relationship were formalised by the Statute of Westminster in 1931 , which applied to Canada without the need for ratification , but Australia , New Zealand , and Newfoundland had to ratify the statute for it to take effect . Newfoundland never did , as on 16 February 1934 , with the consent of its parliament , the government of Newfoundland voluntarily ended and governance reverted to direct control from London . Newfoundland later joined Canada as its 10th province in 1949 . Australia and New Zealand ratified the Statute in 1942 and 1947 respectively .   Although the Union of South Africa was not among the Dominions that needed to adopt the Statute of Westminster for it to take effect , two laws—the Status of the Union Act , 1934 , and the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act of 1934—were passed to confirm South Africa 's status", 'modContext': ' With an estimated population of 2.', 'question': 'In which Commonwealth country are the

  The Commonwealth dates back to the mid-20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories .', " It was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 , which established the member states as `` free and equal '' .", ' The symbol of this free association is Queen Elizabeth II who is the Head of the Commonwealth .', ' The Queen is also the monarch of 16 members of the Commonwealth , known as Commonwealth realms .', ' The other Commonwealth members have different heads of state : 32 members are republics and five are monarchies with a different monarch .', '   Member states have no legal obligation to one another .', ' Instead , they are united by language , history , culture and their shared values of democracy , human

to Canada on Dominion Day in 1959 , pointed out that the confederation of Canada on 1 July 1867 had been the birth of the `` first independent country within the British Empire '' .", ' She declared : `` So , it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of Nations .', " '' As long ago as 1884 , however , Lord Rosebery , while visiting Australia , had described the changing British Empire—as some of its colonies became more independent—as a `` Commonwealth of Nations '' .", ' Conferences of British and colonial prime ministers occurred periodically from the first one in 1887 , leading to the creation of the Imperial Conferences in 1911 .', '   The Commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences .', " A specific proposal was presented by Jan Smuts in 1917 when he coined the term `` the British Commonwealth of Nations '' and envisioned the `` future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence '' at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 by delegates from the Dominions as well as Britain .", ' The term first received imperial statutory recognition in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 , when the term British Commonwealth of Nations was substituted for British Empire in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the Irish Free State .', '   Dominions   In the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference , Britain and its dominions agreed they were `` equal in status , in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs , though united by common allegiance to the Crown , and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations .', " '' These aspects to the relationship were formalised by the Statute of Westminster in 1931 , which applied to Canada without the need for ratification , but Australia , New Zealand , and Newfoundland had to ratify the statute for it to take effect .", ' Newfoundland never did , as on 16 February 1934 , with the consent of its parliament , the government of Newfoundland voluntarily ended and governance reverted to direct control from London .', ' Newfoundland later joined Canada as its 10th province in 1949 .', ' Australia and New Zealand ratified the Statute in 1942 and 1947 respectively .'], 'distance value': [[11, 0.48498764634132385], [19,

Zealand . It is done by pressing one 's nose and forehead ( at the same time ) to another person at an encounter .   It is used at traditional meetings among Māori people and on major ceremonies and serves a similar purpose to a formal handshake in modern western culture , and indeed a hongi is often used in conjunction with one .   In the hongi , the ha ( or breath of life ) , is exchanged and intermingled . The breath of life can also be interpreted as the sharing of both party 's souls .   Through the exchange of this physical greeting , one is no longer considered manuhiri ( visitor ) but rather tangata whenua , one of the people of the land . For the remainder of one 's stay one is obliged to share in all the duties and responsibilities of the home people . In earlier times , this may have meant bearing arms in times of war , or tending crops , such as kumara .   When Māori greet one another by pressing noses , the tradition of sharing the breath of life is considered to have come directly from the gods .

He quickly gets Roger out of the house and drags him through the park to arrange a meeting . He and Anita fall in love and get married .   Later , Perdita gives birth to a litter of fifteen puppies . That same night , they are visited by Cruella De Vil , a wealthy former schoolmate of Anita 's . She offers to buy the entire litter , but Roger says they are not for sale . A few weeks later , she hires her henchmen , Jasper and Horace , to steal them . When Scotland Yard is unable to find them , Pongo and Perdita use the `` Twilight bark '' , a canine gossip line , to ask for help from the other dogs in London .   Colonel , an old sheepdog , along with his compatriots Captain , a gray horse , and Sergeant Tibbs , a tabby cat , find the puppies in a place called Hell Hall ( Cruella 's abandoned and dilapidated family estate , also known as The De Vil Place ) , along with many other dalmatian puppies that she had bought from various dog stores . When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin fur coats , Colonel quickly sends word back to London . Upon receiving the message , Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies . Winter has come , and they have to cross the Stour River which is running fast and laden with slabs of broken ice . Meanwhile , Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them . In response , Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television , but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house . Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies . While the adult dogs attack them , Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house .

father-and-son rag-and-bone business . They live on Oil Drum Lane , a fictional street in Shepherd 's Bush , London . Four series were broadcast by the BBC from 1962 to 1965 , followed by a second run from 1970 to 1974 . Its theme tune , `` Old Ned '' , was composed by Ron Grainer . The series was voted 15th in a 2004 BBC poll to find Britain 's Best Sitcom . It was remade in the US as Sanford and Son , in Sweden as Albert & Herbert and in the Netherlands as Stiefbeen en zoon . In 1972 a film adaptation of the series , Steptoe and Son , was released in cinemas , with a second Steptoe and Son Ride Again in 1973 .   The series focused on the inter-generational conflict of father and son . Albert Steptoe , a `` dirty old man '' , is an old rag-and-bone man , set in his grimy and grasping ways . By contrast his 37-year-old son Harold is filled with social aspirations , not to say pretensions . The show contained elements of drama and tragedy , as Harold was continually prevented from achieving his ambitions . To this end the show was unusual at the time for casting actors rather than comedians in its lead roles , although both actors were drawn into more comedic roles as a consequence .   Background   The show had its roots in a 1962 episode of Galton & Simpson 's Comedy Playhouse . Galton and Simpson 's association with comedian Tony Hancock , for whom they had written Hancock 's Half Hour , had ended and they had agreed to a proposal from the BBC to write a series of ten comedy shows . The fourth in the series , `` The Offer '' , was born both out of writer 's block and budgetary constraints . Earlier shows in the series had cost more than expected , so the writers decided to write a two-hander set in one room . The idea of two brothers was considered but father and son worked best . Ronald Fraser was second choice for Harold , which would have produced a totally different character .   Galton and Simpson were not aiming to make a pilot for a series , having worked for seven years with Hancock . However , Tom Sloan , the BBC 's Head of Comedy , told them during rehearsals that `` The Offer '' was a definite series pilot : he saw that the Steptoe idea had potential , as did the audience of that edition of Comedy Playhouse . Galton and Simpson were reportedly overwhelmed by this reaction , and the first of what became eight series was commissioned , the first four of which were transmitted between 1962 and 1965 . The last four series were broadcast between 1970 and 1974 , now in colour . At the peak of the series ' popularity , it commanded viewing figures of some 28 million per episode . In addition , the early 1970s saw two feature films , two 46-minute Christmas specials . In 2005 , the play Steptoe and Son in Murder at Oil Drum Lane , written by Ray Galton and John Antrobus , brought the storyline to a close .   The series was one of the first UK situation comedy programmes to employ actors rather than comedians in the principal roles . Galton and Simpson had decided that they wanted to try to write for performers who `` did n't count their laughs '' .   The series ' title music , `` Old Ned '' , won its composer Ron Grainer his second successive Ivor Novello award . The series had no standard set of opening titles but the opening sequences would often feature the Steptoes ' horse , Hercules . `` Steptoe and Son '' is the Steptoes ' trading name , but as established in the first episode , the `` Son '' is not Harold but Albert .

independent filmmaker . Spurlock 's film follows a 30-day period from February 1 to March 2 , 2003 , during which he ate only McDonald 's food . The film documents this lifestyle 's drastic effect on Spurlock 's physical and psychological well-being , and explores the fast food industry 's corporate influence , including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit .   Spurlock ate at McDonald 's restaurants three times per day , eating every item on the chain 's menu at least once . Spurlock consumed an average of 20.9 megajoules or 5,000 kcal ( the equivalent of 9.26 Big Macs ) per day during the experiment . An intake of around 2,500 kcal within a healthy balanced diet is more generally recommended for a man to maintain his weight . As a result , the then-32-year-old Spurlock gained , a 13 % body mass increase , increased his cholesterol to 230 mg/dL , and experienced mood swings , sexual dysfunction , and fat accumulation in his liver . It took Spurlock fourteen months to lose the weight gained from his experiment using a vegan diet supervised by his then-girlfriend , a chef who specializes in gourmet vegan dishes .   The reason for Spurlock 's investigation was the increasing spread of obesity throughout U.S. society , which the Surgeon General has declared `` epidemic '' , and the corresponding lawsuit brought against McDonald 's on behalf of two overweight girls , who , it was alleged , became obese as a result of eating McDonald 's food ( Pelman v. McDonald 's Corp. , 237 F. Supp . 2d 512 ) . Spurlock points out that although the lawsuit against McDonald 's failed ( and subsequently many state legislatures have legislated against product liability actions against producers and distributors of `` fast food '' ) , much of the same criticism leveled against the tobacco companies applies to fast food franchises whose product is both physiologically addictive and physically harmful .   The documentary was nominated for an Academy Award for Documentary Feature . A comic book related to the movie has been made with Dark Horse Comics as the publisher containing stories based on numerous cases of fast food health scares .

Kent 's economy is greatly diversified . Haulage , logistics and tourism are major industries throughout the county ; major industries in north-west Kent include aggregate building materials , printing and scientific research . Coal mining has also played its part in Kent 's industrial heritage . Large parts of Kent are within the London commuter belt and its strong transport connections to the capital and the nearby continent makes Kent a high income county . Twenty-eight per cent of the county forms part of two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty : the North Downs and The Weald .   History   The area has been occupied since the Palaeolithic era , as attested by finds from the quarries at Swanscombe . The Medway megaliths were built during the Neolithic era . There is a rich sequence of Bronze Age , Iron Age , and Roman era occupation , as indicated by finds and features such as the Ringlemere gold cup and the Roman villas of the Darent valley .   The modern name of Kent is derived from the Brythonic word Cantus meaning `` rim '' or `` border '' . This describes the eastern part of the current county area as a border land or coastal district . Julius Caesar had described the area as Cantium , or home of the Cantiaci in 51 BC . The extreme west of the modern county was by the time of Roman Britain occupied by Iron Age tribes , known as the Regnenses .   East Kent became a kingdom of the Jutes during the 5th century and was known as Cantia from about 730 and recorded as Cent in 835 . The early medieval inhabitants of the county were known as the Cantwara , or Kent people . These people regarded the city of Canterbury as their capital .   In 597 , Pope Gregory I appointed the religious missionary ( who became Saint Augustine of Canterbury after his death ) as the first Archbishop of Canterbury . In the previous year , Augustine successfully converted the pagan King Æthelberht of Kent to Christianity . The Diocese of Canterbury became Britain 's first Episcopal See with first cathedral and has since remained Britain 's centre of Christianity . The second designated English cathedral was in Kent at Rochester Cathedral .   In the 11th century , the people of Kent adopted the motto Invicta , meaning `` undefeated '' .

Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than 24 hours . Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache , drowsiness , concentration problems , dry mouth , dizziness , fatigue , gastrointestinal distress ( e.g. , vomiting ) , absence of hunger , sweating , nausea , hyper-excitability and anxiety .   While the causes of a hangover are still poorly understood , several factors are known to be involved including acetaldehyde accumulation , changes in the immune system and glucose metabolism , dehydration , metabolic acidosis , disturbed prostaglandin synthesis , increased cardiac output , vasodilation , sleep deprivation and malnutrition . Beverage-specific effects of additives or by-products such as congeners in alcoholic beverages also play an important role . The symptoms occur typically after the intoxicating effect of the alcohol begins to wear off , generally the morning after a night of heavy drinking .   Though many possible remedies and `` folk cures '' have been suggested , there is no compelling evidence to suggest that any are effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover . Avoiding alcohol or drinking in moderation are the most effective ways to avoid a hangover .  The socioeconomic consequences and health risks of alcohol hangover include workplace absenteeism , impaired job performance , reduced productivity and poor academic achievement . A hangover may also compromise potentially dangerous daily activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery .   Signs and symptoms   An alcohol hangover is associated with a variety of symptoms that may include drowsiness , headache , concentration problems , dry mouth , dizziness , gastrointestinal complaints , fatigue , sweating , nausea , hyper-excitability , anxiety and a feeling of general discomfort that may last more than 24 hours . Alcohol hangover symptoms develop when blood alcohol concentration falls considerably and peak when it returns to almost zero . Hangover symptoms validated in controlled studies include general malaise , thirst , headache , feeling dizzy or faint , tiredness , loss of appetite , nausea , stomach ache , and feeling as though one ’ s heart is racing . Some symptoms such as changes in sleep pattern and gastrointestinal distress are attributed to direct effects of the alcohol intoxication , or withdrawal symptoms . Drowsiness and impaired cognitive function are the two dominant features of alcohol hangover .   Causes   The processes which lead to hangovers are still poorly understood . Several pathophysiological changes may give rise to the alcohol hangover including increased levels of acetaldehyde , hormonal alterations of the cytokine pathways and decrease of the availability of glucose . Additional associated phenomena are dehydration , metabolic acidosis , disturbed prostaglandin synthesis , increased cardiac output , vasodilation , sleep deprivation and insufficient eating . Some complex organic molecules found in alcoholic beverages known as congeners may play an important role in producing hangover effects because some , such as methanol , are metabolized to the notably toxic substances formaldehyde and formic acid .   Pathophysiology   After being ingested , ethanol is first converted to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and then to acetic acid by oxidation process . These reactions also convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+ ) to its reduced form NADH in a redox reaction . By causing an imbalance of the NAD+/NADH redox system , alcoholic beverages make normal bodily functions more difficult . Consequences of the alcohol induced redox changes in the human body include increased triglyceride production , increased amino acid catabolism , inhibition of the citric acid cycle , lactic acidosis , ketoacidosis , hyperuricemia , disturbance in cortisol and androgen metabolism and increased fibrogenesis.The metabolism of glucose and insulin are also influenced . However , recent studies showed no significant correlation between hangover severity and the concentrations of various hormones , electrolytes , free fatty acids , triglycerides , lactate , ketone bodies , cortisol , and glucose in blood and urine samples .   Alcohol also induces the CYP2E1 enzyme , which metabolizes ethanol and other substances into more reactive toxins . In particular , in binge drinking the enzyme is activated and plays a role in creating a harmful condition known as oxidative stress which can lead to cell death .   Acetaldehyde   Acetaldehyde , the first by-product of ethanol , is between 10 and 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself and can remain at an elevated plateau for many hours after initial ethanol consumption .

phenomena are dehydration , metabolic acidosis , disturbed prostaglandin synthesis , increased cardiac output , vasodilation , sleep deprivation and insufficient eating .', ' Some complex organic molecules found in alcoholic beverages known as congeners may play an important role in producing hangover effects because some , such as methanol , are metabolized to the notably toxic substances formaldehyde and formic acid .', '   Pathophysiology   After being ingested , ethanol is first converted to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and then to acetic acid by oxidation

substances into more reactive toxins .', ' In particular , in binge drinking the enzyme is activated and plays a role in creating a harmful condition known as oxidative stress which can lead to cell

capable of donating a hydron ( proton or hydrogen ion H+ ) , or , alternatively , capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair ( a Lewis acid ) .   The first category of acids is the proton donors or Brønsted acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ .   Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in acid ' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic .   Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . As these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial sense ) can be solutions or pure substances , and can be derived from acids ( in the strict sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid .   The second category of acids are Lewis acids , which form a covalent bond with an electron pair . An example is boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( NH3 ) . Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( H+ ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs .

1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic , danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music , jazz , and rhythm and blues ( R & B ) . Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground . Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord , distinguishing them from R & B and soul songs , which are built on complex chord progressions . Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz , such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths , or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths .   Like much African-inspired music , funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments such as electric guitar , electric bass , Hammond organ , and drums playing interlocking rhythms . Funk bands sometimes have a horn section of several saxophones , trumpets , and in some cases , a trombone , which plays rhythmic `` hits '' and `` punches '' . Funk originated in the mid-1960s , with James Brown 's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeat—with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure , funky bass lines , drum patterns , and syncopated guitar riffs . Other musical groups , including Sly & the Family Stone and Parliament-Funkadelic , soon began to adopt and develop Brown 's innovations . While much of the written history of funk focuses on men , there have been notable funk women , including Chaka Khan , Labelle , Brides of Funkenstein , Klymaxx , Mother 's Finest , and Betty Davis .   Many of the most famous bands in the genre also played disco and soul extensively . Funk derivatives include funk rock ( e.g. , Red Hot Chili Peppers ) ; boogie ( or electro-funk ) , a form of electronic music ; electro music , a hybrid of electronic music and funk ; funk metal ( e.g. , Living Colour ) ; G-funk , a mix of gangsta rap and funk ; Timba , a form of funky Cuban popular dance music ; and funk jam ( e.g. , Phish ) . Funk samples have been used extensively in genres including hip hop , house music , and drum and bass . It is also the main influence of go-go , a subgenre associated with funk .

.   As Chancellor of the Exchequer ( 1908–1915 ) , Lloyd George was a key figure in the introduction of many reforms which laid the foundations of the modern welfare state . His most important role came as the highly energetic Prime Minister of the Wartime Coalition Government ( 1916–22 ) , during and immediately after the First World War . He was a major player at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that reordered Europe after the defeat of the Central Powers . He arguably made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader , thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain 's social welfare system , his leadership in winning the war , his post-war role in reshaping Europe , and his partitioning Ireland ( between Southern Ireland - later the Irish Free State - and Northern Ireland which remained part of the UK ) .   He was the last Liberal to serve as Prime Minister . Parliamentary support for the coalition premiership was mostly from Conservatives rather than his own Liberals . The Liberal split contributed to the long-term collapse of that party as a major political force . Although he became leader of the Liberal Party in the late 1920s , he was unable to regain power , and by the 1930s he was a marginalised and widely mistrusted figure .   He was voted the third greatest British prime minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by MORI , and in 2002 he was named among the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote .   Upbringing and early life   Lloyd George was born in Chorlton-on-Medlock , Manchester , to Welsh parents , and was brought up as a Welsh-speaker . He is so far the only British Prime Minister to have been Welsh and to have spoken English as a second language .   His father , William George , had been a teacher in both London and Liverpool . He also taught in the Hope Street Sunday Schools , which were administered by the Unitarians , where he met Unitarian minister Dr James Martineau . In March of the same year , on account of his failing health , William George returned with his family to his native Pembrokeshire . He took up farming but died in June 1864 of pneumonia , aged 44 . His widow , Elizabeth George ( 1828–96 ) , sold the farm and moved with her children to her native Llanystumdwy in Caernarfonshire , where she lived in Tŷ Newydd with her brother Richard Lloyd ( 1834–1917 ) , who was a shoemaker , a minister ( in the Scotch Baptists and then the Church of Christ ) , and a strong Liberal . Lloyd George was educated at the local Anglican school Llanystumdwy National School and later under tutors . Lloyd George 's uncle was a towering influence on him , encouraging him to take up a career in law and enter politics ; his uncle remained influential up until his death at age 83 in February 1917 , by which time his nephew had become Prime Minister . He added his uncle 's surname to become `` Lloyd George '' . His surname is usually given as `` Lloyd George '' and sometimes as `` George '' . The influence of his childhood showed through in his entire career , as he attempted to aid the common man at the expense of what he liked to call `` the Dukes '' ( that is , the aristocracy ) . However , his biographer John Grigg argued that Lloyd George 's childhood was nowhere near as poverty-stricken as he liked to suggest , and that a great deal of his self-confidence came from having been brought up by an uncle who enjoyed a position of influence and prestige in his small community .   Brought up a devout evangelical , as a young man he suddenly lost his religious faith . Biographer Don Cregier says he became `` a Deist and perhaps an agnostic , though he remained a chapel-goer and connoisseur of good preaching all his life . '' He kept quiet about that , however , and was hailed as `` one of the foremost fighting leaders of a fanatical Welsh Nonconformity '' .

He was among the first directors to insist on using authentic locations and for mixing stars with civilians to give his films more realism . Within the film industry , he was considered a maverick for taking risks and thereby creating unique films , with many of his stories being dramas about lone and principled individuals tested by tragic events . According to one historian , Zinnemann 's style demonstrated his sense of `` psychological realism and his apparent determination to make worthwhile pictures that are nevertheless highly entertaining . ''   Some of his most notable films were The Men ( 1950 ) , High Noon ( 1952 ) , From Here to Eternity ( 1953 ) , Oklahoma ! ( 1955 ) , The Nun 's Story ( 1959 ) , A Man For All Seasons ( 1966 ) , The Day of the Jackal ( 1973 ) , and Julia ( 1973 ) . His films have received 65 Oscar nominations , winning 24 .

He directed 19 actors to Oscar nominations , including Frank Sinatra , Montgomery Clift , Audrey Hepburn , Glynis Johns , Paul Scofield , Robert Shaw , Wendy Hiller , Jason Robards , Vanessa Redgrave , Jane Fonda , Gary Cooper and Maximilian Schell .   Early life   Zinnemann was born in Rzeszów , Poland ( then part of Austria-Hungary ) , the son of Anna ( Feiwel ) and Oskar Zinnemann , a doctor . His family was Jewish , and he had one younger brother . While growing up in Austria , he wanted to become a musician , but went on to graduate with a law degree from the University of Vienna in 1927 .   While studying law , he became drawn to films and convinced his parents to let him study film production in Paris . After studying for a year at the Ecole Technique de Photographie et Cinématographie in Paris , he became a cameraman and found work on a number of films in Berlin , before emigrating to Hollywood . Both of his parents were killed during the Holocaust .   Career as director   Early career   Zinnemann worked in Germany with several other beginners ( Billy Wilder and Robert Siodmak also worked with him on the 1929 feature People on Sunday ) after he studied filmmaking in France . His penchant for realism and authenticity is evident in his first feature The Wave ( 1935 ) , shot on location in Mexico with mostly non-professional actors recruited among the locals , which is one of the earliest examples of social realism in narrative film . Earlier in the decade , in fact , Zinnemann had worked with documentarian Robert Flaherty , `` probably the greatest single influence on my work as a filmmaker '' , he said .   Although he was fascinated by the arts culture in Germany , with its theater , music and films , he was also aware that the country was in a deep economic crisis . He became disenchanted with Berlin after continually seeing decadent ostentation and luxury existing alongside desperate unemployment . The wealthy classes were moving more to the political right and the poor to the left . `` Emotion had long since begun to displace reason , '' he said . As a result of the changing political climate , along with the fact that sound films had arrived in Europe , which was technically unprepared to produce their own , film production throughout Europe slowed dramatically . Zinnemann , then only 21 , got his parent 's permission to go to America where he hoped filmmaking opportunities would be greater .   He arrived in New York at the end of October , 1929 , at the time of the stock market crash . Despite the financial panic then beginning , he found New York to be a different cultural environment :   He took a Greyhound bus to Hollywood a few months later following the completion of his first directorial effort for the Mexican cultural protest film , The Wave , in", 'modContext': '', 'question': 'Sergio Leone, Otto Preminger, Fritz Lang and Fred Zinnemann are famous 20thC?', 'groundTruth': ['directorial'], 'answer': "Alfred '' Zinnemann", 'modAnswer': 'yes', 'delete sentence number': ["Alfred `` Fred '' Zinnemann ( April 29 , 1907 -

Early life   Graham McPherson was born on 13 January 1961 , in Hastings , Sussex , England , the son of William Rutherford McPherson ( 1935–1975 ) and jazz singer Edith Gower . The couple married in Paddington in 1960 , and Suggs was raised in Hastings by his mother . His father had left by the time Suggs was aged three . In a 2009 interview when asked about what happened to his father :   I do n't know , but what I 've heard has n't been good : heroin , injecting his eyeballs with paraffin , being sectioned . He must be dead now . I mean , he would have got in touch if he was alive , would n't he ? Yeah , he must be dead , poor bugger .   Suggs spent three years of his childhood in Haverfordwest , in Pembrokeshire , and had just started at a grammar school when his mother moved to North London . He then went to a comprehensive school at Quintin Kynaston , Swiss Cottage , North London . On the official Madness website , he has stated :   I was born in Hastings on a stormy evening on 13 January 1961 . I only lived with my mum , so we were free agents . She was a singer in the pubs and clubs . We moved to Liverpool then London . I lived with relations in Wales for a while and came back to London . Because I was an only child , I was pretty insular and stubborn .

Six years later the lease was surrendered , and a new 50-year lease was granted . In the same year , the Grand Stand was replaced with a new West Stand . This was significantly bomb-damaged during the Second World War . Rebuilding of the stand , at a cost in excess of £12,000 , was met by the War Damage Commission in 1953–54 .

The primary identifying mark of a crossbred `` designer dog ' is that the resulting puppies are called by a portmanteau word made up of syllables ( or sounds ) from the breed names of the two purebred parents , such as Schnoodle ( Schnauzer and poodle cross ) . Other purebred breeds are being crossed to provide designer dogs described with an endless range of created labels , such as the Puggle ( Pug and Beagle cross ) . There are even complex crosses ( with multiple breeds in recent ancestry ) being labeled in this manner , such as German Chusky ( German Shepherd Dog , Husky , Chow Chow ) .   Like children in a family , a percentage of designer dogs with the same breed ancestry will look similar to each other , even though crossbreeding does not result in as uniform a phenotype as the breeding of purebreds .

Watergate office complex in Washington , D.C. and President Richard Nixon 's administration 's attempted cover-up of its involvement . When the conspiracy was discovered and investigated by the U.S. Congress , the Nixon administration 's resistance to its probes led to a constitutional crisis .   The term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration . Those activities included such `` dirty tricks '' as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious . Nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures , using the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , and the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) .   The scandal led to the discovery of multiple abuses of power by the Nixon administration , articles of impeachment , and the resignation of Nixon as President of the United States on August 9 , 1974 . The scandal also resulted in the indictment of 69 people , with trials or pleas resulting in 25 being found guilty and incarcerated , many of whom were Nixon 's top administration officials .   The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex on Saturday , June 17 , 1972 . The FBI investigated and discovered a connection between cash found on the burglars and a slush fund used by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President ( CREEP ) , the official organization of Nixon 's campaign . In July 1973 , evidence mounted against the President 's staff , including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the Senate Watergate Committee . The investigation revealed that President Nixon had a tape-recording system in his offices and that he had recorded many conversations .   After a protracted series of bitter court battles , the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the president was obligated to release the tapes to government investigators , and he eventually complied . These audio recordings implicated the president , revealing he had attempted to cover up activities that took place after the break-in and to use federal officials to deflect the investigation .  Facing near-certain impeachment in the House of Representatives and equally certain conviction by the Senate , Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9 , 1974 .

jays , magpies , treepies , choughs , and nutcrackers . In common English , they are known as the crow family , or , more technically , corvids . Over 120 species are described . The genus Corvus , including the jackdaws , crows , and ravens , makes up over a third of the entire family .   They are considered the most intelligent of the birds , and among the most intelligent of all animals , having demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests ( European magpies ) and tool-making ability ( crows , rooks ) —skills until recently regarded as solely the province of humans and a few other higher mammals . Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to that of great apes and cetaceans , and only slightly lower than in humans .   They are medium to large in size , with strong feet and bills , rictal bristles , and a single moult each year ( most passerines moult twice ) . Corvids are found worldwide except for the tip of South America and the polar ice caps . The majority of the species are found in tropical South and Central America , southern Asia and Eurasia , with fewer than 10 species each in Africa and Australasia . The genus Corvus has re-entered Australia in relatively recent geological prehistory , with five species and one subspecies there .   Systematics , taxonomy , and evolution   Over the years , much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives . What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world . Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse , but often Australasian groups . In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s , Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida , based on DNA-DNA hybridization . The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs , birds of paradise , whipbirds , quail-thrushes , whistlers , monarch flycatchers and drongos , shrikes , vireos , and vangas , but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial . The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea , together with their closest relatives ( the birds of paradise , Australian mud-nesters and shrikes ) . They are also the core group of the Corvida , which includes the related groups , such as orioles and vireos .   Clarification of the interrelationships of the corvids has been achieved based on cladistic analysis of several DNA sequences . The jays and magpies do not constitute monophyletic lineages , but rather seem to split up into an American and Old World lineage , and an Holarctic and Oriental lineage , respectively . These are not closely related among each other . The position of the azure-winged magpie , which has always been a major enigma , is even less clear than before .

can be either a dessert or a savory dish . The word pudding is believed to come from the French boudin , originally from the Latin botellus , meaning `` small sausage '' , referring to encased meats used in Medieval European puddings .   In the United Kingdom and some of the Commonwealth countries , pudding can be used to describe both sweet and savory dishes . Unless qualified , however , the term in everyday usage typically denotes a dessert ; in the UK , `` pudding '' is used as a synonym for a dessert course . Dessert puddings are rich , fairly homogeneous starch- or dairy-based desserts such as rice pudding , steamed cake mixtures such as Treacle sponge pudding with or without the addition of ingredients such as dried fruits as in a Christmas pudding.Oxford English Dictionary Savory dishes include Yorkshire pudding , black pudding , suet pudding and steak and kidney pudding .   In the United States and some parts of Canada , pudding characteristically denotes a sweet milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based custards , instant custards or a mousse , often commercially set using cornstarch , gelatin or similar collagen agent such as the Jell‑O brand line of products .   In Commonwealth countries these puddings are called custards ( or curds ) if they are egg-thickened , blancmange if starch-thickened , and jelly if gelatin based . Pudding may also refer to other dishes such as bread pudding and rice pudding , although typically these names derive from the origin as British dishes .   History   The modern usage of the word pudding to denote primarily desserts has evolved over time from the almost exclusive use of the term to describe savoury dishes , specifically those created using a process similar to sausages where meat and other ingredients in a mostly liquid form are encased and then steamed or boiled to set the contents . The most famous examples still surviving are blood sausage , which was a favourite of King Henry VIII , and haggis .   Baked , steamed and boiled puddings   The original pudding was formed by mixing various ingredients with a grain product or other binder such as butter , flour , cereal , eggs , and/or suet , resulting in a solid mass . These puddings are baked , steamed or boiled . Depending on its ingredients , such a pudding may be served as a part of the main course or as a dessert .   Boiled or steamed pudding was a common main course aboard ships in the Royal Navy during the 18th and 19th centuries . Pudding was used as the primary dish in which daily rations of flour and suet were prepared .   Steamed pies consisting of a filling completely enclosed by suet pastry are also known as puddings . These may be sweet or savory and include such dishes as steak and kidney pudding .   Types   Savory   Dessert   Creamy puddings   The second and newer type of pudding consists of sugar , milk , and a thickening agent such as cornstarch , gelatin , eggs , rice or tapioca to create a sweet , creamy dessert . These puddings are made either by simmering on top of the stove in a saucepan or double boiler or by baking in an oven , often in a bain-marie . These puddings are easily scorched on the fire , which is why a double boiler is often used ; microwave ovens are also now often used to avoid this problem and to reduce stirring .   Creamy puddings are typically served chilled , but a few , such as zabaglione and rice pudding , may be served warm . Instant puddings do not require boiling and can therefore be prepared more quickly .   This pudding terminology is common in North America and some European countries such as the Netherlands , whilst in Britain egg-thickened puddings are considered custards and starch-thickened puddings called blancmange .

"Keflavík International Airport ( ) , also known as Reykjavík-Keflavík Airport , is the largest airport in Iceland and the country 's main hub for international transportation . The airport is west of Keflavík and 50 km southwest of Reykjavík . The airport has three runways , two of which are in use , and the airport area is about 25 km2 . Most international journeys to or from Iceland pass through this airport .   The main carriers at Keflavík are Icelandair and WOW air , each of which has the airport as its main hub . The airport is almost exclusively used for international flights ; most domestic flights use Reykjavík Airport , which lies 3 km from Reykjavík 's city centre , although seasonal flights from Akureyri fly to Keflavík . Keflavík Airport is operated by Isavia , a government enterprise .   History   Early years   Originally , the airport was built by the United States military during World War II and opened on March 23 , 1943 . The U.S. named it Meeks Field after a young pilot , George Meeks , who died on the Reykjavík airfield . After the war , the airport and the base were returned to Iceland 's control and were renamed for the nearby town of Keflavik . In 1951 , the U.S. military returned to the airport under a defense agreement between Iceland and the U.S. Later , Iceland joined NATO .   Development since the 1950s   With the reestablishment of the military air base at Keflavík during the 1950s , the air terminal found itself in the middle of a secure military zone . Travelers had to pass through military check points to reach their flights , until 1987 , when the civilian terminal was relocated ...   The presence of foreign military forces in Iceland under the NATO sponsored Iceland–U.S .

Southern United States in the 1920s . It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States such as folk music , Blues music , and Western music . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas . The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are the folk music of mostly white , working-class Americans , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional ballads , and cowboy songs , and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities . In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States .   Generations of country music   Immigrants to the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North America brought the music and instruments of Europe along with them for nearly 300 years . Country music was `` introduced to the world as a Southern phenomenon . '' The first generation emerged in the early 1920s , with Atlanta 's music scene playing a major role in launching country 's earliest recording artists . Okeh Records began issuing hillbilly music records by Fiddlin ' John Carson as early as 1923 , followed by Columbia Records ( series 15000D `` Old Familiar Tunes '' ) ( Samantha Bumgarner ) in 1924 , and RCA Victor Records in 1927 ( the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers ) . Many `` hillbilly '' musicians , such as Cliff Carlisle , recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s .   During the second generation ( 1930s–1940s ) , radio became a popular source of entertainment , and `` barn dance '' shows featuring country music were started all over the South , as far north as Chicago , and as far west as California . The most important was the Grand Ole Opry , aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day . During the 1930s and 1940s , cowboy songs , or Western music , which had been recorded since the 1920s , were popularized by films made in Hollywood . Bob Wills was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains who had become very popular as the leader of a `` hot string band , '' and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns . His mix of country and jazz , which started out as dance hall music , would become known as Western swing . Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band , in 1938 . Country musicians began recording boogie in 1939 , shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall , when Johnny Barfield recorded `` Boogie Woogie '' .   The third generation ( 1950s–1960s ) started at the end of World War II with `` mountaineer '' string band music known as bluegrass , which emerged when Bill Monroe , along with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs were introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry . Gospel music remained a popular component of country music . Another type of stripped-down and raw music with a variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar , bass , dobro or steel guitar ( and later ) drums became popular , especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma . It became known as honky tonk , and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states . By the early 1950s a blend of Western swing , country boogie , and honky tonk was played by most country bands . Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s , and 1956 could be called the year of rockabilly in country music . Beginning in the mid-1950s , and reaching its peak during the early 1960s , the Nashville Sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville , Tennessee . The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres .

The chain had 18 restaurants when Harry Snyder died in 1976 , at the age of 63 .   Second generation   In 1976 , 24-year-old Rich Snyder became the company president after his father 's death . Along with his brother Guy , Rich had reportedly begun working in his father 's In-N-Outs `` from the ground floor '' at an early age . Over the next 20 years , the chain experienced a period of rapid growth under Rich 's leadership , expanding to 93 restaurants .   The first location outside of the Los Angeles metropolitan area was opened in San Diego County in 1990 , the 61st location in the chain . In 1992 , In-N-Out opened its first non-Southern California restaurant in Las Vegas , Nevada . Its first Northern California location was opened the following year in Modesto . Expansion then spread to Northern California , including the San Francisco Bay Area , while additional Las Vegas-area restaurants were added . However , after opening the 83rd In-N-Out restaurant in Fresno , California , on December 15 , 1993 , Rich Snyder and four other passengers died in a plane crash on approach to John Wayne Airport in Orange County , California .

It became a bestseller and sold more than 10 million copies in 20 years . It was also on the London Sunday Times bestseller list for more than four years and was translated into 35 languages by 2001 .   Summary   Stephen Hawking attempts to explain a range of subjects in cosmology , including the Big Bang , black holes and light cones , to the nonspecialist reader . His main goal is to give an overview of the subject , but he also attempts to explain some complex mathematics . In the 1996 edition of the book and subsequent editions , Hawking discusses the possibility of time travel and wormholes and explores the possibility of having a universe without a quantum singularity at the beginning of time .   Early in 1983 , Hawking first approached Simon Mitton , the editor in charge of astronomy books at Cambridge University Press , with his ideas for a popular book on cosmology . Mitton was doubtful about all the equations in the draft manuscript , which he felt would put off the buyers in airport bookshops that Hawking wished to reach . With some difficulty , he persuaded Hawking to drop all but one equation . The author himself notes in the book 's acknowledgements that he was warned that for every equation in the book , the readership would be halved , hence it includes only a single equation : E = mc2 . The book does employ a number of complex models , diagrams , and other illustrations to detail some of the concepts it explores .   Editions   * 1988 : The first edition included an introduction by Carl Sagan that tells the following story : Sagan was in London for a scientific conference in 1974 , and between sessions he wandered into a different room , where a larger meeting was taking place . `` I realized that I was watching an ancient ceremony : the investiture of new fellows into the Royal Society , one of the most ancient scholarly organizations on the planet . In the front row , a young man in a wheelchair was , very slowly , signing his name in a book that bore on its earliest pages the signature of Isaac Newton ... Stephen Hawking was a legend even then . '' In his introduction , Sagan goes on to add that Hawking is the `` worthy successor '' to Newton and Paul Dirac , both former Lucasian Professors of Mathematics .   The introduction was removed after the first edition , as it was copyrighted by Sagan , rather than by Hawking or the publisher , and the publisher did not have the right to reprint it in perpetuity . Hawking wrote his own introduction for later editions .   * 1996 , Illustrated , updated and expanded edition : This hardcover edition contained full-color illustrations and photographs to help further explain the text , as well as the addition of topics that were not included in the original book .  * 1998 , Tenth-anniversary edition : It features the same text as the one published in 1996 , but was also released in paperback and has only a few diagrams included . ISBN 0553109537  * 2005 , A Briefer History of Time : a collaboration with Leonard Mlodinow of an abridged version of the original book . It was updated again to address new issues that had arisen due to further scientific development . ISBN 0-553-80436-7   Film   In 1991 , Errol Morris directed a documentary film about Hawking , but although they share a title , the film is a biographical study of Hawking , and not a filmed version of the book .   Opera   The New York 's Metropolitan Opera has commissioned an opera to premiere in 2015–16 based on Hawking 's book .

the 1996 edition of the book and subsequent editions , Hawking discusses the possibility of time travel and wormholes and explores the possibility of having a universe without a quantum singularity at the beginning of time .', '   Early in 1983 , Hawking first approached Simon Mitton , the editor in charge of astronomy books at Cambridge University Press , with his ideas for a popular book on cosmology .', ' Mitton was doubtful about all the equations in the draft manuscript , which he felt would put off the buyers in airport bookshops that Hawking wished to reach .', ' With some difficulty , he persuaded Hawking to drop all but one equation .', " The author himself notes in the book 's acknowledgements that he was warned that for every equation in the book , the readership

points by placing tiles , each bearing a single letter , onto a gameboard which is divided into a 15×15 grid of squares . The tiles must form words which , in crossword fashion , flow left to right in rows or downwards in columns . The words must be defined in a standard dictionary , or present in specified reference works ( e.g. , the Official Tournament and Club Word List , the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary ) , which provide a list of officially permissible words .   The name Scrabble is a trademark of Hasbro , Inc. in the United States and Canada and has been sold by Hasbro 's Parker Brothers division since 1999 . Prior to 1999 , it was sold as a Milton Bradley game . Outside the United States and Canada , Scrabble is a trademark of Mattel . The game is sold in 121 countries and is available in 29 languages ; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide and roughly one-third of American and half of British homes have a Scrabble set . There are around 4,000 Scrabble clubs around the world .   Game details   The game is played by two to four players on a square board with a 15×15 grid of cells ( individually known as `` squares '' ) , each of which accommodates a single letter tile .  In official club and tournament games , play is between two players or , occasionally , between two teams each of which collaborates on a single rack .   The board is marked with `` premium '' squares , which multiply the number of points awarded : eight dark red `` triple-word '' squares , 17 pink `` double-word '' squares , of which one , the center square ( H8 ) , is marked with a star or other symbol ; 12 dark blue `` triple-letter '' squares , and 24 light blue `` double-letter '' squares . In 2008 , Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW , red for DW , blue for DL , and green for TL . Despite this , the original premium square color scheme is still the preferred scheme for Scrabble boards used in tournaments .   In an English-language set , the game contains 100 tiles , 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value ranging from 1 to 10 . The number of points of each lettered tile is based on the letter 's frequency in standard English writing ; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point , while less common letters score higher , with Q and Z each worth 10 points . The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value . The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter ; once laid on the board , however , the choice is fixed . Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values .   Tiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are 19 x square and 4 mm thick , making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board . Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition varies the width up to 2 mm for different letters . Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles ( e.g . 13 x ) ; sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place . The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter 's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner .   S is the most valuable letter in English-language Scrabble because it easily goes on the ends of words ; Alfred Butts included only four instances to avoid a game that was `` too easy '' . Q is considered the most problematic letter , as most words with it also contain U ; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French , Dutch , Italian and German . J is also difficult to play due to its low frequency and a scarcity of words having it at the end . C and V may be troublesome in the endgame , since no two-letter words with them exist , save for CH in SOWPODS .   History   In 1938 , American architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented called Lexiko .

They were known as `` Independent Whigs '' , `` Friends of Mr Pitt '' , or `` Pittites '' . After Pitt 's death the term `` Tory '' came into use . This was an allusion to the Tories , a political grouping that had existed from 1678 , but which had no organisational continuity with the Pittite party . From about 1812 on the name `` Tory '' was commonly used for the newer party .   The term `` Conservative '' was suggested as a title for the party by a magazine article by J. Wilson Croker in the Quarterly Review in 1830 . The name immediately caught on and was officially adopted under the aegis of Sir Robert Peel around 1834 . Peel is acknowledged as the founder of the Conservative Party , which he created with the announcement of the Tamworth Manifesto . The term `` Conservative Party '' rather than Tory was the dominant usage by 1845 .   Conservatives and Unionists ( 1867–1965 )   The widening of the electoral franchise in the 19th century forced the Conservative Party to popularise its approach under Lord Derby and Benjamin Disraeli , who carried through their own expansion of the franchise with the Reform Act of 1867 . In 1886 the party formed an alliance with Lord Hartington ( later the 8th Duke of Devonshire ) and Joseph Chamberlain 's new Liberal Unionist Party and , under the statesmen Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour , held power for all but three of the following twenty years before suffering a heavy defeat in 1906 when it split over the issue of free trade . In 1912 , the Liberal Unionists merged with the Conservative party . In Ireland , the Irish Unionist Alliance had been formed in 1891 which merged anti-Home Rule Unionists into one political movement . Its MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster , and in essence formed the Irish wing of the party until 1922 .

Edina is joined in her quest by magazine editor Patsy Stone ( played by Joanna Lumley ) , her best friend and enabler , whose drug abuse , alcohol consumption , and promiscuity far eclipse Edina 's comparatively mild self-destructive behaviour . Despite being a middle-aged , twice-divorced career woman , Edina is reliant upon the support of her daughter Saffron ( Julia Sawalha ) , a secondary school pupil ( and later university student ) whose constant care of her mother has left her a bitter cynic . The series also stars June Whitfield as Edina 's sarcastic and thieving mother , and Jane Horrocks as Edina 's brainless personal assistant .

Production   The show has had an extended and sporadic run . The first three series were broadcast on the BBC from 1992 to 1995 , followed by a series finale in the form of a two-part television film entitled The Last Shout in 1996 . Creator Jennifer Saunders revived the show for a fourth series in 2001 , after having written and submitted a pilot entitled Mirrorball , which recruited nearly all of the original cast in new roles . The pilot was intended to be turned into a series of episodes . However , Saunders felt the characters were far too rich and interesting to put aside , and were far better suited for her new story ideas . Instead of Mirrorball , a new series of Absolutely Fabulous was proposed to the BBC , which later commissioned the fourth series in 2001 . From 2001 to 2004 , two full series were produced , along with three one-off hour-long specials ; Gay ( retitled and issued as Absolutely Fabulous in New York for the United States ) in 2002 , Cold Turkey , a Christmas special in 2003 , and White Box ( another series finale ) , which aired in 2004 .

Both channels also co-produced the 20th Anniversary episodes , although Logo has removed some scenes for its airings . BBC America broadcast it in full .

Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1 , 1905 . The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015 .   Alberta is bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east , the Northwest Territories to the north , and the U.S. state of Montana to the south . Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than to areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming .   Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , oil sands ( Athabasca oil sands ) and other northern resource industries .   About 290 km south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta . Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta 's two census metropolitan areas , both of which have populations exceeding one million , while the province has 16 census agglomerations .

Etymology   Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta ( 1848–1939 ) , the fourth daughter of Victoria , Queen of Canada , and Albert , Prince Consort . Princess Louise was the wife of John Campbell , Marquess of Lorne , Governor General of Canada ( 1878–83 ) . Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour .   Geography   Alberta , with an area of 661848 km2 , is the fourth largest province after Quebec , Ontario , and British Columbia . To the south , the province borders on the 49th parallel north , separating it from the US state of Montana , while on the north the 60th parallel north divides it from the Northwest Territories . To the east , the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan , while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains , and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N .   The province extends 1223 km north to south and 660 km east to west at its maximum width . Its highest point is 3747 m at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border , while its lowest point is 152 m on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast .   With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the southeastern section , the province has adequate water resources . There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming , fishing and a range of water sports . There are three large lakes , Lake Claire ( 1436 km2 ) in Wood Buffalo National Park , Lesser Slave Lake ( 1168 km2 ) , and Lake Athabasca ( 7898 km2 ) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan . The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels 1538 km from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca . The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3/s . The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River , a tributary of the Mackenzie River .   Alberta 's capital city , Edmonton , is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province . It is the most northerly major city in Canada , and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada . The region , with its proximity to Canada 's largest oil fields , has most of western Canada 's oil refinery capacity .

R. Cash ; February 26 , 1932 – September 12 , 2003 ) was an American singer-songwriter , guitarist , actor , and author , who was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time , having sold more than 90 million records worldwide . Although primarily remembered as a country music icon , his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll , rockabilly , blues , folk , and gospel . This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music , Rock and Roll , and Gospel Music Halls of Fame .   Cash was known for his deep , calm bass-baritone voice , the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band , a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor , free prison concerts , and a trademark look , which earned him the nickname `` The Man in Black '' . He traditionally began his concerts with the simple `` Hello , I 'm Johnny Cash '' , followed by his signature `` Folsom Prison Blues '' .   Much of Cash 's music echoed themes of sorrow , moral tribulation and redemption , especially in the later stages of his career . His best-known songs included `` I Walk the Line '' , `` Folsom Prison Blues '' , `` Ring of Fire '' , `` Get Rhythm '' and `` Man in Black '' . He also recorded humorous numbers like `` One Piece at a Time '' and `` A Boy Named Sue '' ; a duet with his future wife , June Carter , called `` Jackson '' ( followed by many further duets after their marriage ) ; and railroad songs including `` Hey , Porter '' , `` Orange Blossom Special '' and `` Rock Island Line '' . During the last stage of his career , Cash covered songs by several late 20th century rock artists , most notably `` Hurt '' by Nine Inch Nails .   Early life and influences   Cash was born on February 26 , 1932 , in Kingsland , Arkansas , one of seven children born to Ray Cash ( May 13 , 1897 , Kingsland , Arkansas – December 23 , 1985 , Hendersonville , Tennessee ) and Carrie Cloveree ( née Rivers ; March 13 , 1904 , Rison , Arkansas – March 11 , 1991 , Hendersonville , Tennessee ) .  He was mostly of Scottish and English ancestry , and as an adult traced his surname to 11th-century Fife , Scotland , after meeting with the then-laird of Falkland , Fife , Major Michael Crichton-Stuart . Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the name of his family .   At birth , Cash was named J. R. Cash . When Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force , he was not permitted to use initials as a first name , so he changed his name to John R. Cash . In 1955 , when signing with Sun Records , he took Johnny Cash as his stage name .   The Cash children were : Roy , Margaret Louise , Jack , J. R. , Reba , Joanne , and Tommy . Tommy Cash also became a successful country artist . In March 1935 , when Cash was three years old , the family settled in Dyess , Arkansas . He started working in cotton fields at age five , singing along with his family while working . The family farm was flooded on at least two occasions , which later inspired him to write the song `` Five Feet High and Rising '' . His family 's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs , especially those about other people facing similar difficulties .   Cash was very close to his older brother , Jack . In May 1944 , Jack was pulled into a whirling head saw in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two . He suffered for over a week before he died on May 20 , 1944 , at age 15 . Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident . According to Cash : The Autobiography , his father was away that morning , but he and his mother , and Jack himself , all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day , causing his mother to urge Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother .

766 injured it is the worst disaster in British sporting history . It remains one of the world 's worst football disasters . It happened during the 1988–89 FA Cup semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest , being played at the neutral venue of Hillsborough , home ground of Sheffield Wednesday . The disaster resulted in a number of safety improvements in the largest football grounds , notably the elimination of standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadia , and the removal of spectator fencing , introduced to prevent pitch invasions . Initial investigations attached most of the blame to the police , but the coroner 's inquest ruled the deaths as accidental and no prosecutions followed . Aggrieved relatives launched a campaign for truth and justice , initially rebuffed , but eventually succeeding in gaining a new inquest verdict in 2016 , exonerating fans of any blame and recording a verdict of unlawful killing .   The crush occurred in the two central pens in the Leppings Lane stand , allocated to Liverpool fans ; in an attempt to ease overcrowding outside the entrance turnstiles shortly before kick-off , the police match commander chief superintendent David Duckenfield had ordered an exit gate to be opened , leading to a sudden influx of around 2,000 supporters through a tunnel leading to the central pens , trapping spectators already in the pens , with fences to their front and sides . With the kick-off due at 3 pm , the gate was opened 2:52 pm ; by 3:06 pm the game had been stopped .   Many of the myths about the disaster emerged in the following days , as police fed false stories to the press , resulting in the headline `` The Truth '' in the national tabloid newspaper The Sun . These persisted even after the Taylor Report of 1990 , which found the main reason for the disaster was a failure of control by South Yorkshire Police ( SYP ) , and that fans ' behaviour played no part in it . Despite Taylor criticising the police 's attempts to shift blame , the Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution against individuals or institutions . Families strongly rejected the coroner 's subsequent ruling , disagreeing with his decision not to examine events after 3.15 pm . New evidence claimed by controversial TV documentary Hillsborough in 1996 failed to convince authorities , with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concluding in 1997 there was no justification for a new inquiry . Private prosecutions against Duckenfield and his deputy Bernard Murray failed in 2000 .   A turning point came in 2009 when government minister Andy Burnham was heckled during the 20th anniversary memorial ; it led to the formation of the Hillsborough Independent Panel to review all evidence .

{'test case number': 89, 'context': 'Fish are consumed as food by many species , including humans . It has been an important source of protein and other nutrients for humans throughout recorded history .   In culinary and fishery contexts , the term fish can also include shellfish , such as molluscs , crustaceans and echinoderms . English does not distinguish between fish as an animal and the food prepared from it , as it does with pig vs. pork or cow vs. beef . Some other languages do , as in the Spanish peces versus pescado . The modern English word for fish comes from the Old English word fisc ( plural : fiscas ) which was pronounced as it is today . English also has the term seafood , which covers fish found in the seas and oceans as well as other marine life used as food .   Species   Over 32,000 species of fish have been described , making them the most diverse group of vertebrates . In addition , there are many species of shellfish . However , only a small number of species are commonly eaten by humans .   Preparation   Fish can be prepared in a variety of ways . It can be uncooked ( raw ) ( cf . sashimi ) . It can be cured by marinating ( cf . ceviche ) , pickling ( cf . pickled herring ) , or smoking ( cf . smoked salmon ) . Or it can be cooked by baking , frying ( cf . fish and chips ) , grilling , poaching ( cf . court-bouillon ) , or steaming . Many of the preservation techniques used in different cultures have since become unnecessary but are still performed for their resulting taste and texture when consumed .   Nutritional value   `` Fish provides a good source of high quality protein and contains many vitamins and minerals . It may be classed as either whitefish , oily fish , or shellfish . Whitefish , such as haddock and seer , contain very little fat ( usually less than 1 % ) whereas oily fish , such as sardines , contain between 10-25 % . The latter , as a result of its high fat content , contain a range of fat-soluble vitamins ( A , D , E and K ) and essential fatty acids , all of which are vital for the healthy functioning of the body . `` Fellows P and Hampton A ( Eds . ) ( 1992 ) [ http : //www.fao.org/Wairdocs/X5434E/x5434e0f.htm # 11. % 20fish % 20and % 20fish % 20products Fish and fish products ] Chapter 11 in : Small-scale food processing - A guide for appropriate equipment Intermediate Technology Publications , FAO , Rome . ISBN 1 85339 108 5 .   Health benefits   Research over the past few decades has shown that the nutrients and minerals in fish , and particularly the omega-3 fatty acids found in pelagic fishes , are heart-friendly and can make improvements in brain development and reproduction . This has highlighted the role for fish in the functionality of the human body .   Health hazards   Fish is the most common food to obstruct the airway and cause choking . Choking on fish was responsible for about 4,500 reported accidents in the UK in 1998 .   Allergens   A seafood allergy is a hypersensitivity to an allergen which can be present in fish , and particularly in shellfish . This can result in an overreaction of the immune system and lead to severe physical symptoms . Most people who have a food allergy also have a seafood allergy . Allergic reactions can result from ingesting seafood , or by breathing in vapours from preparing or cooking seafood . The most severe seafood allergy reaction is anaphylaxis , an emergency requiring immediate attention . It is treated with epinephrine .   Biotoxins   Some species of fish , notably the puffer fugu used for sushi , and some kinds of shellfish , can result in serious poisoning if not prepared properly . These fish always contain these poisons as a defense against predators ; it is not present due to environmental circumstances . Particularly , fugu has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the national examination in Japan . Ciguatera poisoning can occur from eating larger fish from warm tropical waters , such as sea bass , grouper , and red snapper .

and the lead singer of the band Stereophonics . Influenced by classic rock bands such as Pink Floyd , The Who , Led Zeppelin , AC/DC and Sex Pistols , Jones is noted for his raspy voice , which has been described as `` whiskey '' and has drawn criticism as well as acclaim . As a lyricist , Jones is influenced by Neil Young , Bob Catley , Steve Perry , Bob Dylan and Otis Redding .   History   Early life and début   Jones lived in the village of Cwmaman , near Aberdare , where he became friends with neighbours , Stuart Cable and Richard Jones and they formed a covers band together . Showing a talent for writing in his youth , he considered being a scriptwriter before being a musician and studied film at college . The BBC showed an interest in some of his early work but , as the band progressed from a cover band to writing their original material , he decided to use his narrative side more towards writing lyrics . Jones also flirted with the idea of boxing as a career and was a successful boxer at youth level . Much of his early life is documented in Stereophonics ' debut album , including his account of his teen years on a market stall . These are documented in `` More Life in a Tramps Vest '' from Stereophonics ' first album released in 1997 , Word Gets Around .   In 1999 Stereophonics were the first band to be signed to Richard Branson 's new Virgin Records label V2 . Their debut EP Looks Like Chaplin did not have enough copies made to enter the charts and their next single Local Boy in the Photograph was one place shy of making the UK Top 50 . However , their debut LP Word Gets Around did , however , make it to number 6 on the UK Albums Chart . Fellow Welsh band Manic Street Preachers put the band as support on their 1996-97 tour .   1998 - present : Mainstream success   In February 1998 , they received a Brit Award for Best New Group , the same week as a re-issue of Local Boy in the Photograph made number 14 in the charts and their first album went gold in the UK , selling over 100,000 copies . During that year Stereophonics had tours in Europe , Australia and the USA . They performed a concert on 12 June 1998 at Cardiff Castle . They performed a cover of the Randy Newman song Mama Told Me Not to Come with Tom Jones for his album Reload .   After another tour , they re-entered the studios and recorded Just Enough Education to Perform , containing the single Mr . Writer and Have a Nice Day , and Step on My Old Size Nines . A cover of Rod Stewart 's version of Mike D'Abo 's song Handbags & Gladrags was added to later editions of the album . They also recorded their biggest audience to date when they played to 80,000 in Slane Castle in Ireland and ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium , Cardiff , supported by Feeder and Ocean Colour Scene - who they had supported years before .   They released their fourth studio album You Got ta Go There to Come Back with songs like Maybe Tomorrow and Madame Helga and a re-worked song that had not been completed in time - Moviestar . They re-issued the album with this track included .   In 2002 , the band was chosen as a support act for Counting Crows and toured on various UK dates with the band . Subsequently Jones would join the band on stage and perform Mr. Jones and Hanginaround alongside Adam Duritz .   In 2003 , whilst on tour in Germany , drummer Stuart Cable - whom by this time had his own television chat show on BBC Wales - was sacked from the band by Jones , citing problems over `` commitment '' . Cable was replaced temporarily on the remainder of the tour by Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman . According to Stuart , `` I kept pluggin ' away .

Duke of Wellington ) defeated the French under Major-General Jean-Andoche Junot near the village of Vimeiro , near Lisbon , Portugal during the Peninsular War . This battle put an end to the first French invasion of Portugal .   Four days after the Battle of Roliça , Wellesley 's army was attacked by a French army under General Junot near the village of Vimeiro . The battle began as a battle of manoeuvre , with French troops attempting to outflank the British left , but Wellesley was able to redeploy his army to face the assault . Meanwhile , Junot sent in two central columns but these were forced back by sustained volleys from troops in line . Soon afterwards , the flanking attack was beaten off and Junot retreated towards Torres Vedras having lost 2,000 men and 13 cannon , compared to 700 Anglo-Portuguese losses . No pursuit was attempted because Wellesley was superseded by Sir Harry Burrard and then Sir Hew Dalrymple ( one having arrived during the battle , the second soon after ) .   Prelude   After Roliça , Wellesley had established a position near Vimeiro . By holding the village , plus some ridges to the west , the British commander covered a beachhead at Maceira Bay a little further to the west . Since most of his reinforcements had arrived by 20 August , Wellesley planned to advance south on Lisbon . Eight independent infantry brigades under Rowland Hill , Ronald Fergusson , Miles Nightingall , Barnard Bowes , Catlin Craufurd , Henry Fane , Robert Anstruther and Wroth Acland formed the core of Wellesley 's forces . Rounding out his force were 17 cannons , 240 light cavalry led by C. D. Taylor and about 2,000 Portuguese troops under Nicholas Trant , giving a total of 20,000 men .   Junot organised his 14,000-man force into two infantry divisions and a cavalry division under Pierre Margaron . Henri François Delaborde 's infantry division contained two brigades under Antoine François Brenier and Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières , while Louis Henri Loison 's division included two brigades commanded by Jean-Baptiste Solignac and Hugues Charlot . In addition , François Étienne de Kellermann commanded a 2,100-man reserve made up of four converged grenadier battalions . These units were created by taking the grenadier company from each of Junot 's infantry battalions . The French took 23 cannons into battle with them .   Wellesley placed Anstruther 's and Fane 's brigades in front of Vimeiro , with Acland 's men in support . At first , his five remaining brigades held only the western ridge . Junot planned to send Thomieres , Solignac and Charlot 's infantry brigades to capture Vimeiro , while Brenier 's 4,300-man brigade and some dragoons swung in a wide flanking manoeuvre to seize an empty ridge to the northeast of the village . Wellesley detected Brenier 's move and switched Nightingall , Fergusson and Bowes to the northeastern ridge . Once Junot realised that British troops occupied the ridge , he sent Solignac 's brigade to the right to assist Brenier 's attack . The French commander decided to launch his attack on the town immediately , instead of waiting for his flanking move to develop .   Battle   All the preliminary moves and countermoves caused a series of uncoordinated French attacks . First , Thomieres ' 2,100-man brigade approached the British position . Supported by three cannons and screened by skirmishers , the brigade was formed into a column of companies .   The first company of 120 men formed in a three-deep line would have a front rank 40 men wide . All the other companies formed behind the first company , making the entire brigade about 40 files wide and 48 ranks deep . According to French doctrine , as soon as the enemy main position was found , the companies would peel off to the right or left to form a firing line many companies wide and only three files deep . On the other hand , French commanders often pressed home attacks while in column , depending entirely upon their skirmishers and artillery to provide the necessary fire support .   To counter the French skirmishers , Fane detached four companies of riflemen ( 60th Regiment of Foot & 95th Rifles ) . These outnumbered and outfought the French skirmishers , who fell back to the sides of the brigade column . Without their skirmishers in front of them , the French column blundered into the 945 men of the 50th Regiment .", 'modContext': '', 'question': 'The name of which person born in Dublin is connected

, Baroness Thatcher , ( Roberts ; 13 October 1925 – 8 April 2013 ) was a British stateswoman and politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and the Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 . She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her the `` Iron Lady '' , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   Originally a research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her re-election in 1983 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge ( referred to as the `` poll tax '' ) was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher , of Kesteven in the county of Lincolnshire , which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to prerecord a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 . In 2013 , she died of another stroke in London at the age of 87 .   Early life and education   Thatcher was born Margaret Hilda Roberts on 13 October 1925 , in Grantham , Lincolnshire . Her father was Alfred Roberts , originally from Northamptonshire , and her mother was Beatrice Ethel ( née Stephenson ) from Lincolnshire . She spent her childhood in Grantham , where her father owned two grocery shops . She and her older sister Muriel ( 1921–2004 ) were raised in the flat above the larger of the two , on North Parade . Her father was active in local politics and the Methodist church , serving as an alderman and a local preacher , and brought up his daughter as a strict Wesleyan Methodist attending the Finkin Street Methodist Church .

The Who developed from an earlier group , the Detours , and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements , featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage . Their first single as the Who , `` I Ca n't Explain '' , reached the UK top ten , followed by a string of singles including `` My Generation '' , `` Substitute '' and `` Happy Jack '' . In 1967 , they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single `` I Can See for Miles '' , while touring extensively . The group 's fourth album , 1969 's rock opera Tommy , included the single `` Pinball Wizard '' and was a critical and commercial success . Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival , along with the live album Live at Leeds , cemented their reputation as a respected rock act .

fictional character Peter Macfarlane , is a character created by the journalist and writer Neil Munro in a series of stories published in the Glasgow Evening News between 1905 and 1923 under the pen name of Hugh Foulis .   Para Handy is the crafty Gaelic skipper of the Vital Spark , a Clyde puffer ( steamboat ) of the sort that delivered goods from Glasgow to Loch Fyne , the Hebrides , and the west coast highlands of Scotland in the early 20th century . The stories partly focus on his pride in his ship , `` the smertest boat in the tred '' which he considers to be of a class with the Clyde steamers , but mainly tell of the “ High Jinks ” the crew get up to on their travels . He had at least one crossover with Munro 's other popular character , Erchie MacPherson of Erchie , My Droll Friend . The name is an anglicisation of `` Para Shandaidh '' , which means `` Peter ( Paraig ) son of Sandy '' , and he is content to describe himself as `` Chust wan of Brutain 's hardy sons '' .   The other principal characters forming the four man crew include Dan Macphail the effete ( very subtly so ) engineer , Dougie the superstitious ship ’ s mate , The Tar ( real name Colin Turner ) the lazy deckhand , and The Tar 's replacement Sunny Jim ( real name Davie Green and cousin to the Tar ) , as the young squeezebox-playing deck hand . Also featured is Hurricane Jack ( real name John Maclachlan ) , Para Handy ’ s rather more outrageous adventurer friend . One inconsistency in the stories is that Dougie the mate has the choice of two surnames - Cameron or Campbell . Key points of friction among the crew are : transporting Ministers ( bad luck ) , transporting gravestones ( bad luck ) , the small boats carrying passengers across the Clyde in Glasgow called the Cluthas ( in Para Handy ’ s view , the lowest of the low in Clyde shipping ) , and Macphail ’ s taste for bodice-ripping women ’ s pulp fiction .   Stories   The stories are set in the Firth of Clyde , Loch Fyne and occasionally the Western Isles of Scotland . The stories are loved , partly for their very Scottish humour and also for their evocation of a lost era of the life of these coastal communities when they depended completely on the water and not , as now , on road transport and the ferry service . This is a time when Gaelic was still spoken by some as their native language and everyone in the community was known to all , for good or ill . The church ( the kirk ) was much more significant in community life and there is a lot of humour derived from scriptural misquotations which contemporary readers , with their thorough knowledge of the Bible , would have understood . Reference is also made to schisms in the kirk , with the same humour , which could sting those who were over serious in defence of their splinter denomination .   To the connoisseur these stories give an insight to the life and attitude of the Firth of Clyde , its tributary sea lochs and the city of Glasgow . They were written as occasional pieces in the `` Looker On '' column in the `` Glasgow Evening News '' and , as such were designed to be recognisable to Glaswegians with Highland backgrounds and also those who were city bred but regularly escaped the smoke to go `` doon the watter '' to the Clyde resorts of Rothesay , Millport , Dunoon and Tighnabruaich . The Vital spark also makes it to Arran and , notably , Loch Fyne which were more adventurous destinations but also accessible to city dwellers by the railway steamers which Para Handy so often envies .   Some of the stories were written over the period of the First World War and give insights into the 'home front ' of the time , casting it always in humorous light . This reveals the value of these popular pieces as sources which reflect the life of the community in the Edwardian and WW1 years in the area . Read alongside narrative history of the Western Front they reveal a poignancy . Many of these rural communities could be devastated by a single day 's action in the war , yet the stories were lighthearted . Nevertheless the stories remained popular .
