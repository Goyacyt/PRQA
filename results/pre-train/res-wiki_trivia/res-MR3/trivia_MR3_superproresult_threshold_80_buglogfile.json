{"test case number": 0, "context": "White is an achromatic color , a color without hue . An incoming light to the human eye that stimulates all its three types of color sensitive cone cells in nearly equal amounts results in white . White is one of the most common colors in nature , the color of sunlight , snow , milk , chalk , limestone and other common minerals . In many cultures white represents or signifies purity , innocence , and light , and is the symbolic opposite of black , or darkness . According to surveys in Europe and the United States , white is the color most often associated with perfection , the good , honesty , cleanliness , the beginning , the new , neutrality , and exactitude .   In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome , priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity , and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity , and a white lamb sacrifice and purity ; the widows of kings dressed in white rather than black as the color of mourning . It sometimes symbolizes royalty ; it was the color of the French kings ( black being the color of the queens ) and of the monarchist movement after the French Revolution as well as of the movement called the White Russians ( not to be confounded with Belarus , literally `` White Russia '' ) who fought the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War ( 1917\u20131922 ) . Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble , and beginning in the 18th century , with the advent of neoclassical architecture , white became the most common color of new churches , capitols and other government buildings , especially in the United States . It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity , simplicity and strength .   White is an important color for almost all world religions . The Pope , the head of the Roman Catholic Church , has worn white since 1566 , as a symbol of purity and sacrifice . In Islam , and in the Shinto religion of Japan , it is worn by pilgrims ; and by the Brahmins in India . In Western cultures and in Japan , white is the most common color for wedding dresses , symbolizing purity and virginity . In many Asian cultures , white is also the color of mourning .   The white color on television screens and computer monitors is created with the RGB color model by mixing red , green and blue light at equal intensities .

The winning team is the one that scores the most runs , including any extras gained , during their period batting .   At the start of each game , two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play . The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team , known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , towards a set of wooden stumps , in front of which stands one of the batsmen , known as the striker . The striker 's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat , and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs . The other batsman , known as the non-striker , waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler . The bowler 's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman , at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease .   The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball , leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat , and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground . Runs are scored through two main methods : either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary , or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball . If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground , a run-out occurs . Adjudication is performed on-field by two umpires .

{"test case number": 20, "context": "Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound with the formula . In its pure form , it is a colourless liquid , slightly more viscous than water ; however , for safety reasons it is normally used as a solution . Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide ( a compound with an oxygen\u2013oxygen single bond ) and finds use as a weak oxidizer , bleaching agent and disinfectant . Concentrated hydrogen peroxide , or `` high-test peroxide '' , is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry .   Hydrogen peroxide is often described as being `` water but with one more oxygen atom '' , a description that can give the incorrect impression of significant chemical similarity between the two compounds . While they have a similar melting point and appearance , pure hydrogen peroxide will explode if heated to boiling , will cause serious contact burns to the skin and can set materials alight on contact . For these reasons it is usually handled as a dilute solution ( household grades are typically 3\u20136 % in the U.S. and somewhat higher in Europe ) . Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond .   Structure and properties   Properties   The boiling point of has been extrapolated as being 150.2 \u00b0C , approximately 50 \u00b0C higher than water . In practice hydrogen peroxide will undergo potentially explosive thermal decomposition if heated to this temperature . It may be safely distilled at lower temperatures under reduced pressure .   Aqueous solutions   In aqueous solutions hydrogen peroxide differs from the pure material due to the effects of hydrogen bonding between water and hydrogen peroxide molecules . Hydrogen peroxide and water form a eutectic mixture , exhibiting freezing-point depression ; pure water has a melting point of 0 \u00b0C and pure hydrogen peroxide of \u22120.43 \u00b0C , but a 50 % ( by volume ) solution of the two freezes at \u221251 \u00b0C . The boiling point of the same mixtures is also depressed in relation with the mean of both boiling points ( 125.1 \u00b0C ) . It occurs at 114 \u00b0C . This boiling point is 14 \u00b0C greater than that of pure water and 36.2 \u00b0C less than that of pure hydrogen peroxide .   Structure   Hydrogen peroxide ( ) is a nonplanar molecule with ( twisted ) C2 symmetry . Although the O\u2212O bond is a single bond , the molecule has a relatively high rotational barrier of 2460 cm\u22121 ( 29.45 kJ/mol ) ; for comparison , the rotational barrier for ethane is 12.5 kJ/mol . The increased barrier is ascribed to repulsion between the lone pairs of the adjacent oxygen atoms and results in hydrogen peroxide displaying atropisomerism .   The molecular structures of gaseous and crystalline are significantly different . This difference is attributed to the effects of hydrogen bonding , which is absent in the gaseous state . Crystals of are tetragonal with the space group D'P4121 .   Comparison with analogues   Hydrogen peroxide has several structural analogues with Hm\u2212X\u2212X\u2212Hn bonding arrangements ( water also shown for comparison ) . It has the highest ( theoretical ) boiling point of this series ( X = O , N , S ) . Its melting point is also fairly high , being comparable to that of hydrazine and water , with only hydroxylamine crystallising significantly more readily , indicative of particularly strong hydrogen bonding . Diphosphane and hydrogen disulfide exhibit only weak hydrogen bonding and have little chemical similarity to hydrogen peroxide . All of these analogues are thermodynamically unstable . Structurally , the analogues all adopt similar skewed structures , due to repulsion between adjacent lone pairs .   Discovery   Hydrogen peroxide was first described in 1818 by Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard , who produced it by treating barium peroxide with nitric acid . An improved version of this process used hydrochloric acid , followed by addition of sulfuric acid to precipitate the barium sulfate byproduct . Th\u00e9nard 's process was used from the end of the 19th century until the middle of the 20th century .   Pure hydrogen peroxide was long believed to be unstable , as early attempts to separate it from the water , which is present during synthesis , all failed . This instability was due to traces of impurities ( transition-metal salts ) , which catalyze the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide . Pure hydrogen peroxide was first obtained in 1894 \u2014 almost 80 years after its discovery \u2014 by Richard Wolffenstein , who produced it by vacuum distillation .

{"test case number": 23, "context": "Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash . Various grains ( which may be malted ) are used for different varieties , including barley , corn ( maize ) , rye , and wheat . Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks , generally made of charred white oak .   Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types . The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains , distillation , and aging in wooden barrels .   Etymology   The word whisky ( or whiskey ) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce ( or uisge ) meaning `` water '' ( now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic , and uisge in Scottish Gaelic ) . Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae ( `` water of life '' ) . This was translated to Classical Gaelic as / `` water of life '' . Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe ( 1581 ) , usquebaugh ( 1610 ) , usquebath ( 1621 ) , and usquebae ( 1715 ) .   Names and spellings   Much is made of the word 's two spellings : whisky and whiskey . There are two schools of thought on the issue . One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word , indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer ( like the difference between color and colour ; or recognize and recognise ) , and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described . There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label , the spelling on the label should not be altered . Some writers refer to `` whisk ( e ) y '' or `` whisky/whiskey '' to acknowledge the variation .   The spelling whiskey is common in Ireland and the United States , while whisky is used in all other whisky producing countries . In the US , the usage has not always been consistent . From the late eighteenth century to the mid twentieth century , American writers used both spellings interchangeably until the introduction of newspaper style guides . Since the 1960s , American writers have increasingly used whiskey as the accepted spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and whisky for aged grain spirits made outside the US . However , some prominent American brands , such as George Dickel , Maker 's Mark , and Old Forester ( all made by different companies ) , use the whisky spelling on their labels , and the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits , the legal regulations for spirit in the US , also use the whisky spelling throughout .   `` Scotch '' is the internationally recognized term for `` Scotch whisky '' .   History   It is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC , with perfumes and aromatics being distilled , but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretation of evidence . The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD , but these were not distillations of alcohol . The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks , and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century , but again these were not distillations of alcohol . Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins , with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century.Book [ https : //books.google.com/books ? id  XeqWOkKYn28C & printsecfrontcover A Short History of the Art of Distillation ] , by Robert James Forbes ( year 1948 ) .

{"test case number": 45, "context": "The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th century\u2014when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms\u2014until 1707 , when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain .   In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms , united by \u00c6thelstan ( r. 927\u2013939 ) , became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre .   Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066\u20131154 , Plantagenet 1154\u20131485 , Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649\u20131660 ) .  Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became `` more English in nature '' ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor .

{"test case number": 50, "context": "An acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron ( proton or hydrogen ion H+ ) , or , alternatively , capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair ( a Lewis acid ) .   The first category of acids is the proton donors or Br\u00f8nsted acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Br\u00f8nsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Br\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ .   Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/ac\u0113re meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in acid ' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic .   Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . As these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial sense ) can be solutions or pure substances , and can be derived from acids ( in the strict sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid .   The second category of acids are Lewis acids , which form a covalent bond with an electron pair . An example is boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( NH3 ) . Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Br\u00f8nsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( H+ ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs . However , hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids can not form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids . Conversely , many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids . In modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a Br\u00f8nsted acid and not a Lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid .   Definitions and concepts   Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids .   Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions , or can be dissolved in water , so the Arrhenius and Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant .   The Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton ( H+ ) from an acid to a base .   Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions . Interestingly , although alcohols and amines can be Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids , they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms .   Arrhenius acids   The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions ( H+ ) or protons in 1884 . An Arrhenius acid is a substance that , when added to water , increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water . Note that chemists often write H+ ( aq ) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus , a proton , does not exist alone in water , it exists as the hydronium ion , H3O+ .

{"test case number": 52, "context": "David Lloyd George , 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor , ( 17 January 1863 \u2013 26 March 1945 ) was a British Liberal politician and statesman .   As Chancellor of the Exchequer ( 1908\u20131915 ) , Lloyd George was a key figure in the introduction of many reforms which laid the foundations of the modern welfare state . His most important role came as the highly energetic Prime Minister of the Wartime Coalition Government ( 1916\u201322 ) , during and immediately after the First World War . He was a major player at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that reordered Europe after the defeat of the Central Powers . He arguably made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader , thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain 's social welfare system , his leadership in winning the war , his post-war role in reshaping Europe , and his partitioning Ireland ( between Southern Ireland - later the Irish Free State - and Northern Ireland which remained part of the UK ) .   He was the last Liberal to serve as Prime Minister . Parliamentary support for the coalition premiership was mostly from Conservatives rather than his own Liberals . The Liberal split contributed to the long-term collapse of that party as a major political force . Although he became leader of the Liberal Party in the late 1920s , he was unable to regain power , and by the 1930s he was a marginalised and widely mistrusted figure .   He was voted the third greatest British prime minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by MORI , and in 2002 he was named among the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote .   Upbringing and early life   Lloyd George was born in Chorlton-on-Medlock , Manchester , to Welsh parents , and was brought up as a Welsh-speaker . He is so far the only British Prime Minister to have been Welsh and to have spoken English as a second language .   His father , William George , had been a teacher in both London and Liverpool . He also taught in the Hope Street Sunday Schools , which were administered by the Unitarians , where he met Unitarian minister Dr James Martineau . In March of the same year , on account of his failing health , William George returned with his family to his native Pembrokeshire . He took up farming but died in June 1864 of pneumonia , aged 44 . His widow , Elizabeth George ( 1828\u201396 ) , sold the farm and moved with her children to her native Llanystumdwy in Caernarfonshire , where she lived in T\u0177 Newydd with her brother Richard Lloyd ( 1834\u20131917 ) , who was a shoemaker , a minister ( in the Scotch Baptists and then the Church of Christ ) , and a strong Liberal . Lloyd George was educated at the local Anglican school Llanystumdwy National School and later under tutors . Lloyd George 's uncle was a towering influence on him , encouraging him to take up a career in law and enter politics ; his uncle remained influential up until his death at age 83 in February 1917 , by which time his nephew had become Prime Minister . He added his uncle 's surname to become `` Lloyd George '' . His surname is usually given as `` Lloyd George '' and sometimes as `` George '' . The influence of his childhood showed through in his entire career , as he attempted to aid the common man at the expense of what he liked to call `` the Dukes '' ( that is , the aristocracy ) . However , his biographer John Grigg argued that Lloyd George 's childhood was nowhere near as poverty-stricken as he liked to suggest , and that a great deal of his self-confidence came from having been brought up by an uncle who enjoyed a position of influence and prestige in his small community .   Brought up a devout evangelical , as a young man he suddenly lost his religious faith . Biographer Don Cregier says he became `` a Deist and perhaps an agnostic , though he remained a chapel-goer and connoisseur of good preaching all his life . '' He kept quiet about that , however , and was hailed as `` one of the foremost fighting leaders of a fanatical Welsh Nonconformity '' .   It was also during this period of his life that Lloyd George first became interested in the issue of land ownership .

During the summer the rugby ground 's temporary East Stand is removed to make way for cricket on a larger pitch . This cricket pitch is used for local contests and was used by Somerset County Cricket Club until 2011 . [ http : //www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/303.html Cricket Archive ] Recreation Ground , Bath Parts of the eastern area of the Rec are used by Bath Hockey Club , Bath Croquet Club , Bath Drama Club and for some tennis courts . Pitches are available for amateur sports such as Football , Volleyball and Lacrosse . There is a cricket pavilion at the William Street entrance to the ground . The council-run Sports and Leisure Centre is located on the southern edge of the Rec , accessed via North Parade .   In former years the Rec was subject to periodic flooding from the River Avon , but a flood alleviation scheme in the 1960s improved the flow of the river . However , the Rec remains part of the floodplain at risk of occasional flooding . The ground can still get very boggy after heavy rains .   History   In the early part of the 1890s , the land on which the Recreation Ground now lies as well as the North Parade land were part of the Bathwick Estate , which was owned by the Forester family . In 1894 , a lease was granted to the Directors of The Bath and County Recreation Ground Company Limited by Captain G W Forester . This lease allowed work to be carried out on the land which would make it suitable for cricket matches , lawn tennis and archery tournaments , football matches and all other outdoor sports . As part of this work , a cricket pavilion was started on the north side of the ground . The first Bath rugby matches were also played on the ground in 1884 . Three years later , the ground hosted its maiden first-class cricket match , with Somerset County Cricket Club hosting the Gentlemen of Philadelphia as part of the Bath Cricket Festival . The company 's lease was extended for a further 21 years in 1908 , at a rent of \u00a3100 per year . Fourteen years later , the land was conveyed to The Bath and County Recreation Ground Company Limited for \u00a36,050 . The company then conveyed the North Parade Land , including a building which was used as an ice skating rink , to Bath Artcraft Limited for \u00a32,500 .   A new lease was granted to Bath F.C . in 1927 , allowing them the use of the land on the west side of ground , along with a Grand Stand , a New ( North ) Stand and a Pavilion , for a term of 25 years . Six years later the lease was surrendered , and a new 50-year lease was granted . In the same year , the Grand Stand was replaced with a new West Stand . This was significantly bomb-damaged during the Second World War . Rebuilding of the stand , at a cost in excess of \u00a312,000 , was met by the War Damage Commission in 1953\u201354 . The 'Club Room ' building was erected in 1954 , to the west of the North Stand , and during the same year a lease was granted to allow a tennis club to use the north east corner of the ground . In 1956 , the ground was conveyed to the Mayor Aldermen and the Citizens of the City of Bath ( the Corporation ) for \u00a311,155 .   Bath F.C . surrendered their 1933 lease , and were granted a new 75-year lease in 1973 . In 1974 , both the Recreation Ground and the North Parade Land were transferred to Bath City Council , who erected a Sports and Leisure Centre on the south side in 1975 .

When the conspiracy was discovered and investigated by the U.S. Congress , the Nixon administration 's resistance to its probes led to a constitutional crisis .   The term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration . Those activities included such `` dirty tricks '' as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious . Nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures , using the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , and the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) .   The scandal led to the discovery of multiple abuses of power by the Nixon administration , articles of impeachment , and the resignation of Nixon as President of the United States on August 9 , 1974 . The scandal also resulted in the indictment of 69 people , with trials or pleas resulting in 25 being found guilty and incarcerated , many of whom were Nixon 's top administration officials .   The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex on Saturday , June 17 , 1972 .

In common English , they are known as the crow family , or , more technically , corvids . Over 120 species are described . The genus Corvus , including the jackdaws , crows , and ravens , makes up over a third of the entire family .   They are considered the most intelligent of the birds , and among the most intelligent of all animals , having demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests ( European magpies ) and tool-making ability ( crows , rooks ) \u2014skills until recently regarded as solely the province of humans and a few other higher mammals . Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to that of great apes and cetaceans , and only slightly lower than in humans .   They are medium to large in size , with strong feet and bills , rictal bristles , and a single moult each year ( most passerines moult twice ) . Corvids are found worldwide except for the tip of South America and the polar ice caps . The majority of the species are found in tropical South and Central America , southern Asia and Eurasia , with fewer than 10 species each in Africa and Australasia . The genus Corvus has re-entered Australia in relatively recent geological prehistory , with five species and one subspecies there .

In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s , Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida , based on DNA-DNA hybridization . The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs , birds of paradise , whipbirds , quail-thrushes , whistlers , monarch flycatchers and drongos , shrikes , vireos , and vangas , but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial .

{"test case number": 68, "context": "Rhinitis or coryza is irritation and inflammation of the mucous membrane inside the nose . Common symptoms are a stuffy nose , runny nose , sneezing , and post-nasal drip .   In rhinitis , the inflammation of the mucous membrane is caused by viruses , bacteria , irritants or allergens . The most common kind of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis , which is usually triggered by airborne allergens such as pollen and dander . Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms , such as sneezing and nasal itching , coughing , headache , fatigue , malaise , and cognitive impairment . The allergens may also affect the eyes , causing watery , reddened , or itchy eyes and puffiness around the eyes . The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of mucus , commonly producing a runny nose , as well as a stuffy nose and post-nasal drip . In the case of allergic rhinitis , the inflammation is caused by the degranulation of mast cells in the nose . When mast cells degranulate , they release histamine and other chemicals , starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose , such as fatigue and malaise . In the case of infectious rhinitis , it may occasionally lead to pneumonia , either viral pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia . Sneezing also occurs in infectious rhinitis to expel bacteria and viruses from the respiratory system .   Rhinitis is very common . Allergic rhinitis is more common in some countries than others ; in the United States , about 10 % \u201330 % of adults are affected annually .   Types   Rhinitis is categorized into three types ( although infectious rhinitis is typically regarded as a separate clinical entity due to its transient nature ) : ( i ) infectious rhinitis includes acute and chronic bacterial infections ; ( ii ) nonallergic ( vasomotor ) rhinitis includes idiopathic , hormonal , atrophic , occupational , and gustatory rhinitis , as well as rhinitis medicamentosa ( drug-induced ) ; ( iii ) allergic rhinitis , triggered by pollen , mold , animal dander , dust , Balsam of Peru , and other inhaled allergens .   Infectious   Rhinitis is commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection , including the common cold , which is caused by Rhinoviruses , Coronaviruses , and influenza viruses , others caused by adenoviruses , human parainfluenza viruses , human respiratory syncytial virus , enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses , metapneumovirus , and measles virus , or bacterial sinusitis , which is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and Moraxella catarrhalis . Symptoms of the common cold include rhinorrhea , sneezing , sore throat ( pharyngitis ) , cough , congestion , and slight headache .   Nonallergic rhinitis   Nonallergic rhinitis refers to rhinitis that is not due to an allergy . It was formerly known as vasomotor rhinitis as the cause was thought to be vasodilation caused by an overactive parasympathetic nerve response . It is now encompassed under the more general classification of nonallergic rhinitis . The diagnosis is made upon excluding allergic causes . It is an umbrella term of rhinitis of multiple causes , such as occupational ( chemical ) , smoking , gustatory , hormonal , senile ( rhinitis of the elderly ) , atrophic , medication-induced ( including rhinitis medicamentosa ) , local allergic rhinitis , non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome ( NARES ) and idiopathic ( vasomotor or non-allergic , non-infectious perennial allergic rhinitis ( NANIPER ) , or non-infectious non-allergic rhinitis ( NINAR ) .   In vasomotor rhinitis , certain nonspecific stimuli , including changes in environment ( temperature , humidity , barometric pressure , or weather ) , airborne irritants ( odors , fumes ) , dietary factors ( spicy food , alcohol ) , sexual arousal , exercise , and emotional factors trigger rhinitis .

It remains one of the world 's worst football disasters . It happened during the 1988\u201389 FA Cup semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest , being played at the neutral venue of Hillsborough , home ground of Sheffield Wednesday . The disaster resulted in a number of safety improvements in the largest football grounds , notably the elimination of standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadia , and the removal of spectator fencing , introduced to prevent pitch invasions . Initial investigations attached most of the blame to the police , but the coroner 's inquest ruled the deaths as accidental and no prosecutions followed . Aggrieved relatives launched a campaign for truth and justice , initially rebuffed , but eventually succeeding in gaining a new inquest verdict in 2016 , exonerating fans of any blame and recording a verdict of unlawful killing .   The crush occurred in the two central pens in the Leppings Lane stand , allocated to Liverpool fans ; in an attempt to ease overcrowding outside the entrance turnstiles shortly before kick-off , the police match commander chief superintendent David Duckenfield had ordered an exit gate to be opened , leading to a sudden influx of around 2,000 supporters through a tunnel leading to the central pens , trapping spectators already in the pens , with fences to their front and sides . With the kick-off due at 3 pm , the gate was opened 2:52 pm ; by 3:06 pm the game had been stopped .   Many of the myths about the disaster emerged in the following days , as police fed false stories to the press , resulting in the headline `` The Truth '' in the national tabloid newspaper The Sun . These persisted even after the Taylor Report of 1990 , which found the main reason for the disaster was a failure of control by South Yorkshire Police ( SYP ) , and that fans ' behaviour played no part in it . Despite Taylor criticising the police 's attempts to shift blame , the Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution against individuals or institutions . Families strongly rejected the coroner 's subsequent ruling , disagreeing with his decision not to examine events after 3.15 pm . New evidence claimed by controversial TV documentary Hillsborough in 1996 failed to convince authorities , with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concluding in 1997 there was no justification for a new inquiry .

{"test case number": 91, "context": "Kelly Jones ( born 3 June 1974 ) is a Welsh singer-songwriter , guitarist and director and the lead singer of the band Stereophonics . Influenced by classic rock bands such as Pink Floyd , The Who , Led Zeppelin , AC/DC and Sex Pistols , Jones is noted for his raspy voice , which has been described as `` whiskey '' and has drawn criticism as well as acclaim . As a lyricist , Jones is influenced by Neil Young , Bob Catley , Steve Perry , Bob Dylan and Otis Redding .   History   Early life and d\u00e9but   Jones lived in the village of Cwmaman , near Aberdare , where he became friends with neighbours , Stuart Cable and Richard Jones and they formed a covers band together . Showing a talent for writing in his youth , he considered being a scriptwriter before being a musician and studied film at college . The BBC showed an interest in some of his early work but , as the band progressed from a cover band to writing their original material , he decided to use his narrative side more towards writing lyrics . Jones also flirted with the idea of boxing as a career and was a successful boxer at youth level . Much of his early life is documented in Stereophonics ' debut album , including his account of his teen years on a market stall . These are documented in `` More Life in a Tramps Vest '' from Stereophonics ' first album released in 1997 , Word Gets Around .   In 1999 Stereophonics were the first band to be signed to Richard Branson 's new Virgin Records label V2 . Their debut EP Looks Like Chaplin did not have enough copies made to enter the charts and their next single Local Boy in the Photograph was one place shy of making the UK Top 50 . However , their debut LP Word Gets Around did , however , make it to number 6 on the UK Albums Chart . Fellow Welsh band Manic Street Preachers put the band as support on their 1996-97 tour .   1998 - present : Mainstream success   In February 1998 , they received a Brit Award for Best New Group , the same week as a re-issue of Local Boy in the Photograph made number 14 in the charts and their first album went gold in the UK , selling over 100,000 copies . During that year Stereophonics had tours in Europe , Australia and the USA . They performed a concert on 12 June 1998 at Cardiff Castle . They performed a cover of the Randy Newman song Mama Told Me Not to Come with Tom Jones for his album Reload .   After another tour , they re-entered the studios and recorded Just Enough Education to Perform , containing the single Mr . Writer and Have a Nice Day , and Step on My Old Size Nines . A cover of Rod Stewart 's version of Mike D'Abo 's song Handbags & Gladrags was added to later editions of the album . They also recorded their biggest audience to date when they played to 80,000 in Slane Castle in Ireland and ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium , Cardiff , supported by Feeder and Ocean Colour Scene - who they had supported years before .   They released their fourth studio album You Got ta Go There to Come Back with songs like Maybe Tomorrow and Madame Helga and a re-worked song that had not been completed in time - Moviestar . They re-issued the album with this track included .   In 2002 , the band was chosen as a support act for Counting Crows and toured on various UK dates with the band . Subsequently Jones would join the band on stage and perform Mr. Jones and Hanginaround alongside Adam Duritz .   In 2003 , whilst on tour in Germany , drummer Stuart Cable - whom by this time had his own television chat show on BBC Wales - was sacked from the band by Jones , citing problems over `` commitment '' . Cable was replaced temporarily on the remainder of the tour by Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman . According to Stuart , `` I kept pluggin ' away . I knew when we started we were n't very good and I was waiting for it to get better . It was becoming obvious that was n't going to happen and I said so . Kelly did n't like that '' .

An incoming light to the human eye that stimulates all its three types of color sensitive cone cells in nearly equal amounts results in white . White is one of the most common colors in nature , the color of sunlight , snow , milk , chalk , limestone and other common minerals . In many cultures white represents or signifies purity , innocence , and light , and is the symbolic opposite of black , or darkness . According to surveys in Europe and the United States , white is the color most often associated with perfection , the good , honesty , cleanliness , the beginning , the new , neutrality , and exactitude .   In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome , priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity , and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity , and a white lamb sacrifice and purity ; the widows of kings dressed in white rather than black as the color of mourning . It sometimes symbolizes royalty ; it was the color of the French kings ( black being the color of the queens ) and of the monarchist movement after the French Revolution as well as of the movement called the White Russians ( not to be confounded with Belarus , literally `` White Russia \'\' ) who fought the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War ( 1917\\u20131922 ) . Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble , and beginning in the 18th century , with the advent of neoclassical architecture , white became the most common color of new churches , capitols and other government buildings , especially in the United States . It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity , simplicity and strength .   White is an important color for almost all world religions . The Pope , the head of the Roman Catholic Church , has worn white since 1566 , as a symbol of purity and sacrifice . In Islam , and in the Shinto religion of Japan , it is worn by pilgrims ; and by the Brahmins in India . In Western cultures and in Japan , white is the most common color for wedding dresses , symbolizing purity and virginity . In many Asian cultures , white is also the color of mourning .

At the start of each game , two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play . The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team , known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , towards a set of wooden stumps , in front of which stands one of the batsmen , known as the striker . The striker \'s role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat , and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs . The other batsman , known as the non-striker , waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler . The bowler \'s intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman , at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease .   The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball , leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat , and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground .

Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .

Various grains ( which may be malted ) are used for different varieties , including barley , corn ( maize ) , rye , and wheat . Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks , generally made of charred white oak .   Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types . The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains , distillation , and aging in wooden barrels .   Etymology   The word whisky ( or whiskey ) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce ( or uisge ) meaning `` water \'\' ( now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic , and uisge in Scottish Gaelic ) . Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae ( `` water of life \'\' ) . This was translated to Classical Gaelic as / `` water of life \'\' . Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe ( 1581 ) , usquebaugh ( 1610 ) , usquebath ( 1621 ) , and usquebae ( 1715 ) .   Names and spellings   Much is made of the word \'s two spellings : whisky and whiskey . There are two schools of thought on the issue . One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word , indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer ( like the difference between color and colour ; or recognize and recognise ) , and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described . There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label , the spelling on the label should not be altered . Some writers refer to `` whisk ( e ) y \'\' or `` whisky/whiskey \'\' to acknowledge the variation .   The spelling whiskey is common in Ireland and the United States , while whisky is used in all other whisky producing countries . In the US , the usage has not always been consistent . From the late eighteenth century to the mid twentieth century , American writers used both spellings interchangeably until the introduction of newspaper style guides . Since the 1960s , American writers have increasingly used whiskey as the accepted spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and whisky for aged grain spirits made outside the US . However , some prominent American brands , such as George Dickel , Maker \'s Mark , and Old Forester ( all made by different companies ) , use the whisky spelling on their labels , and the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits , the legal regulations for spirit in the US , also use the whisky spelling throughout .   `` Scotch \'\' is the internationally recognized term for `` Scotch whisky \'\' .   History   It is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC , with perfumes and aromatics being distilled , but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretation of evidence . The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD , but these were not distillations of alcohol . The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks , and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century , but again these were not distillations of alcohol .

He was the first English King of Ireland , and continued the nominal claim by English monarchs to the Kingdom of France . Henry was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty , succeeding his father , Henry VII .   Henry is known for his consequential role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church , besides his six marriages and many extramarital affairs , as well as his effort to obtain an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon , which led to conflict with the Pope . His disagreements with the Pope led Henry to separate the Church of England from papal authority , with himself as king and as the Supreme Head of the Church of England ; the disputes also led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries . His principal dispute was with papal authority rather than with doctrinal matters , and he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings despite his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church . Henry oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . He is also well known for a long personal rivalry with both Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , with whom he frequently warred .   Domestically , Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution , ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings to England . Besides asserting the sovereign \'s supremacy over the Church of England , thus initiating the English Reformation , he greatly expanded royal power . Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent , and those accused were often executed without a formal trial , by means of bills of attainder . He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers , some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour . People such as Thomas Wolsey , Thomas More , Thomas Cromwell , Richard Rich , and Thomas Cranmer figured prominently in Henry \'s administration . He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert money into royal revenue that was formerly paid to Rome . Despite the influx of money from these sources , Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars .   His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated , and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne \'\' . Besides ruling with considerable power , he was also an author and composer . His desire to provide England with a male heir stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly from his belief that a daughter would be unable to consolidate Tudor power and maintain the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses . This led to the two things for which Henry is most remembered : his six marriages and his break with the Pope ( who would not allow an annulment of Henry \'s first marriage ) . As he aged , Henry became severely obese and his health suffered , contributing to his death in 1547 . He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful , egotistical , harsh , and insecure king . He was succeeded by his son Edward VI .   Early years   Born 28June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich , London , Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York .

( proton or hydrogen ion H+ ) , or , alternatively , capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair ( a Lewis acid ) .   The first category of acids is the proton donors or Br\\u00f8nsted acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Br\\u00f8nsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Br\\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ .   Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/ac\\u0113re meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as \'acid \' ( as in \'dissolved in acid \' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic .   Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . As these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial sense ) can be solutions or pure substances , and can be derived from acids ( in the strict sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid .   The second category of acids are Lewis acids , which form a covalent bond with an electron pair . An example is boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( NH3 ) . Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Br\\u00f8nsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( H+ ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs . However , hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids can not form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids . Conversely , many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids . In modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a Br\\u00f8nsted acid and not a Lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid .   Definitions and concepts   Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids .   Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions , or can be dissolved in water , so the Arrhenius and Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant .   The Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton ( H+ ) from an acid to a base .   Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions . Interestingly , although alcohols and amines can be Br\\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids , they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms .   Arrhenius acids   The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions ( H+ ) or protons in 1884 . An Arrhenius acid is a substance that , when added to water , increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water . Note that chemists often write H+ ( aq ) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus , a proton , does not exist alone in water , it exists as the hydronium ion , H3O+ .

statesman .   As Chancellor of the Exchequer ( 1908\\u20131915 ) , Lloyd George was a key figure in the introduction of many reforms which laid the foundations of the modern welfare state . His most important role came as the highly energetic Prime Minister of the Wartime Coalition Government ( 1916\\u201322 ) , during and immediately after the First World War . He was a major player at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that reordered Europe after the defeat of the Central Powers . He arguably made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader , thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain \'s social welfare system , his leadership in winning the war , his post-war role in reshaping Europe , and his partitioning Ireland ( between Southern Ireland - later the Irish Free State - and Northern Ireland which remained part of the UK ) .   He was the last Liberal to serve as Prime Minister . Parliamentary support for the coalition premiership was mostly from Conservatives rather than his own Liberals . The Liberal split contributed to the long-term collapse of that party as a major political force . Although he became leader of the Liberal Party in the late 1920s , he was unable to regain power , and by the 1930s he was a marginalised and widely mistrusted figure .   He was voted the third greatest British prime minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by MORI , and in 2002 he was named among the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote .   Upbringing and early life   Lloyd George was born in Chorlton-on-Medlock , Manchester , to Welsh parents , and was brought up as a Welsh-speaker . He is so far the only British Prime Minister to have been Welsh and to have spoken English as a second language .   His father , William George , had been a teacher in both London and Liverpool . He also taught in the Hope Street Sunday Schools , which were administered by the Unitarians , where he met Unitarian minister Dr James Martineau . In March of the same year , on account of his failing health , William George returned with his family to his native Pembrokeshire . He took up farming but died in June 1864 of pneumonia , aged 44 . His widow , Elizabeth George ( 1828\\u201396 ) , sold the farm and moved with her children to her native Llanystumdwy in Caernarfonshire , where she lived in T\\u0177 Newydd with her brother Richard Lloyd ( 1834\\u20131917 ) , who was a shoemaker , a minister ( in the Scotch Baptists and then the Church of Christ ) , and a strong Liberal . Lloyd George was educated at the local Anglican school Llanystumdwy National School and later under tutors . Lloyd George \'s uncle was a towering influence on him , encouraging him to take up a career in law and enter politics ; his uncle remained influential up until his death at age 83 in February 1917 , by which time his nephew had become Prime Minister . He added his uncle \'s surname to become `` Lloyd George \'\' . His surname is usually given as `` Lloyd George \'\' and sometimes as `` George \'\' . The influence of his childhood showed through in his entire career , as he attempted to aid the common man at the expense of what he liked to call `` the Dukes \'\' ( that is , the aristocracy ) . However , his biographer John Grigg argued that Lloyd George \'s childhood was nowhere near as poverty-stricken as he liked to suggest , and that a great deal of his self-confidence came from having been brought up by an uncle who enjoyed a position of influence and prestige in his small community .

Biographer Don Cregier says he became `` a Deist and perhaps an agnostic , though he remained a chapel-goer and connoisseur of good preaching all his life . \'\' He kept quiet about that , however , and was hailed as `` one of the foremost fighting leaders of a fanatical Welsh Nonconformity \'\' .

treepies , choughs , and nutcrackers . In common English , they are known as the crow family , or , more technically , corvids . Over 120 species are described . The genus Corvus , including the jackdaws , crows , and ravens , makes up over a third of the entire family .   They are considered the most intelligent of the birds , and among the most intelligent of all animals , having demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests ( European magpies ) and tool-making ability ( crows , rooks ) \\u2014skills until recently regarded as solely the province of humans and a few other higher mammals . Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to that of great apes and cetaceans , and only slightly lower than in humans .   They are medium to large in size , with strong feet and bills , rictal bristles , and a single moult each year ( most passerines moult twice ) . Corvids are found worldwide except for the tip of South America and the polar ice caps . The majority of the species are found in tropical South and Central America , southern Asia and Eurasia , with fewer than 10 species each in Africa and Australasia . The genus Corvus has re-entered Australia in relatively recent geological prehistory , with five species and one subspecies there .   Systematics , taxonomy , and evolution   Over the years , much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives . What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world . Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse , but often Australasian groups . In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s , Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida , based on DNA-DNA hybridization . The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs , birds of paradise , whipbirds , quail-thrushes , whistlers , monarch flycatchers and drongos , shrikes , vireos , and vangas , but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial . The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea , together with their closest relatives ( the birds of paradise , Australian mud-nesters and shrikes ) . They are also the core group of the Corvida , which includes the related groups , such as orioles and vireos .   Clarification of the interrelationships of the corvids has been achieved based on cladistic analysis of several DNA sequences .

Common symptoms are a stuffy nose , runny nose , sneezing , and post-nasal drip .   In rhinitis , the inflammation of the mucous membrane is caused by viruses , bacteria , irritants or allergens .

Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms , such as sneezing and nasal itching , coughing , headache , fatigue , malaise , and cognitive impairment .

The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of mucus , commonly producing a runny nose , as well as a stuffy nose and post-nasal drip .

Influenced by classic rock bands such as Pink Floyd , The Who , Led Zeppelin , AC/DC and Sex Pistols , Jones is noted for his raspy voice , which has been described as `` whiskey \'\' and has drawn criticism as well as acclaim . As a lyricist , Jones is influenced by Neil Young , Bob Catley , Steve Perry , Bob Dylan and Otis Redding .   History   Early life and d\\u00e9but   Jones lived in the village of Cwmaman , near Aberdare , where he became friends with neighbours , Stuart Cable and Richard Jones and they formed a covers band together . Showing a talent for writing in his youth , he considered being a scriptwriter before being a musician and studied film at college . The BBC showed an interest in some of his early work but , as the band progressed from a cover band to writing their original material , he decided to use his narrative side more towards writing lyrics . Jones also flirted with the idea of boxing as a career and was a successful boxer at youth level . Much of his early life is documented in Stereophonics \' debut album , including his account of his teen years on a market stall . These are documented in `` More Life in a Tramps Vest \'\' from Stereophonics \' first album released in 1997 , Word Gets Around .   In 1999 Stereophonics were the first band to be signed to Richard Branson \'s new Virgin Records label V2 . Their debut EP Looks Like Chaplin did not have enough copies made to enter the charts and their next single Local Boy in the Photograph was one place shy of making the UK Top 50 . However , their debut LP Word Gets Around did , however , make it to number 6 on the UK Albums Chart . Fellow Welsh band Manic Street Preachers put the band as support on their 1996-97 tour .   1998 - present : Mainstream success   In February 1998 , they received a Brit Award for Best New Group , the same week as a re-issue of Local Boy in the Photograph made number 14 in the charts and their first album went gold in the UK , selling over 100,000 copies . During that year Stereophonics had tours in Europe , Australia and the USA . They performed a concert on 12 June 1998 at Cardiff Castle . They performed a cover of the Randy Newman song Mama Told Me Not to Come with Tom Jones for his album Reload .   After another tour , they re-entered the studios and recorded Just Enough Education to Perform , containing the single Mr . Writer and Have a Nice Day , and Step on My Old Size Nines . A cover of Rod Stewart \'s version of Mike D\'Abo \'s song Handbags & Gladrags was added to later editions of the album . They also recorded their biggest audience to date when they played to 80,000 in Slane Castle in Ireland and ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium , Cardiff , supported by Feeder and Ocean Colour Scene - who they had supported years before .   They released their fourth studio album You Got ta Go There to Come Back with songs like Maybe Tomorrow and Madame Helga and a re-worked song that had not been completed in time - Moviestar . They re-issued the album with this track included .   In 2002 , the band was chosen as a support act for Counting Crows and toured on various UK dates with the band . Subsequently Jones would join the band on stage and perform Mr. Jones and Hanginaround alongside Adam Duritz .   In 2003 , whilst on tour in Germany , drummer Stuart Cable - whom by this time had his own television chat show on BBC Wales - was sacked from the band by Jones , citing problems over `` commitment \'\' . Cable was replaced temporarily on the remainder of the tour by Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman . According to Stuart , `` I kept pluggin \' away . I knew when we started we were n\'t very good and I was waiting for it to get better . It was becoming obvious that was n\'t going to happen and I said so . Kelly did n\'t like that \'\' .
