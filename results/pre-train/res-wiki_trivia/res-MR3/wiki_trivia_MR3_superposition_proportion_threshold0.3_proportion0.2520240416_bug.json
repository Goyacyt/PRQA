[{"test case number": 0, "context": "White is an achromatic color , a color without hue . An incoming light to the human eye that stimulates all its three types of color sensitive cone cells in nearly equal amounts results in white . White is one of the most common colors in nature , the color of sunlight , snow , milk , chalk , limestone and other common minerals . In many cultures white represents or signifies purity , innocence , and light , and is the symbolic opposite of black , or darkness . According to surveys in Europe and the United States , white is the color most often associated with perfection , the good , honesty , cleanliness , the beginning , the new , neutrality , and exactitude .   In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome , priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity , and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity , and a white lamb sacrifice and purity ; the widows of kings dressed in white rather than black as the color of mourning . It sometimes symbolizes royalty ; it was the color of the French kings ( black being the color of the queens ) and of the monarchist movement after the French Revolution as well as of the movement called the White Russians ( not to be confounded with Belarus , literally `` White Russia '' ) who fought the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War ( 1917\u20131922 ) . Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble , and beginning in the 18th century , with the advent of neoclassical architecture , white became the most common color of new churches , capitols and other government buildings , especially in the United States . It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity , simplicity and strength .   White is an important color for almost all world religions . The Pope , the head of the Roman Catholic Church , has worn white since 1566 , as a symbol of purity and sacrifice . In Islam , and in the Shinto religion of Japan , it is worn by pilgrims ; and by the Brahmins in India . In Western cultures and in Japan , white is the most common color for wedding dresses , symbolizing purity and virginity . In many Asian cultures , white is also the color of mourning .   The white color on television screens and computer monitors is created with the RGB color model by mixing red , green and blue light at equal intensities .

In nature , snow and clouds appear white because they are composed of water droplets or ice crystals mixed with air ; when white sunlight enters snow , very little of the spectrum is absorbed ; almost all of the light is reflected or scattered by the air and water molecules , so the snow appears to be the color of sunlight , white . Beaches with sand containing high amounts of quartz or eroded limestone also appear white , since quartz and limestone reflect or scatter sunlight , rather than absorbing it . Tropical white sand beaches may also have a high quantity of white calcium carbonate from tiny bits of seashells ground to fine sand by the action of the waves .

The Tempest   Prospero is the rightful Duke of Milan , whose usurping brother , Antonio , had put him ( with his then three-year old daughter , Miranda ) to sea on `` a rotten carcass of a butt [ boat ] '' to die , 12 years before the play begins . Prospero and Miranda survived and found exile on a small island . He has learned sorcery from books , and uses it while on the island to protect Miranda and control the other characters . Before the play has begun , Prospero frees Ariel from entrapment within `` a cloven pine '' , about which Prospero states :   Prospero 's sorcery is sufficiently powerful to control Ariel and other spirits , as well as to alter weather and even raise the dead : `` Graves at my command have waked their sleepers , oped , and let 'em forth , by my so potent Art . `` - Act V , scene 1 .   On the island , Prospero becomes master of the monster Caliban ( the son of Sycorax , a malevolent witch ) and forces Caliban into submission by punishing him with magic if he does not obey . Ariel is beholden to Prospero after he is freed from his imprisonment inside the pine tree .   At the end of the play , Prospero intends to drown his book and renounce magic . In the view of the audience , this may have been required to make the ending unambiguously happy , as magic was associated with diabolical works ; he will drown his books for the same reason that Doctor Faust , in an earlier play by Christopher Marlowe , promised in vain to burn his books .   Prospero 's speech   The final soliloquy and epilogue in The Tempest is considered to be one of the most memorable speeches in Shakespearean literature .   Now my charms are all o'erthrown ,  And what strength I have 's mine own ,  Which is most faint : now , 't is true ,  I must be here confined by you ,  Or sent to Naples . Let me not ,  Since I have my dukedom got  And pardon 'd the deceiver , dwell  In this bare island by your spell ;  But release me from my bands  With the help of your good hands :  Gentle breath of yours my sails  Must fill , or else my project fails ,  Which was to please . Now I want  Spirits to enforce , art to enchant ,  And my ending is despair ,  Unless I be relieved by prayer ,  Which pierces so that it assaults  Mercy itself and frees all faults .  As you from crimes would pardon 'd be ,  Let your indulgence set me free .   In it , Prospero states his loss ( magic ) and his continuing imprisonment if the audience is not pleased .

century . Dada in Z\u00fcrich , Switzerland , began in 1916 at Cabaret Voltaire , spreading to Berlin shortly thereafter , but the height of New York Dada was the year before , in 1915 . The term anti-art , a precursor to Dada , was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 when he created his first readymades . Dada , in addition to being anti-war , had political affinities with the radical left and was also anti-bourgeois .   At least two works qualified as pre-Dadaist , a posteriori , had already sensitized the public and artists alike : Ubu Roi ( 1896 ) by Alfred Jarry , and the ballet Parade ( 1916\u201317 ) by Erik Satie . The roots of Dada lay in pre-war avant-garde . Cubism and the development of collage , combined with Wassily Kandinsky 's theoretical writings and abstraction , detached the movement from the constraints of reality and convention . The influence of French poets and the writings of German Expressionists liberated Dada from the tight correlation between words and meaning . Avant-garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments . They had seen ( or participated in ) Cubist exhibitions held at Galer\u00eda Dalmau , Barcelona ( 1912 ) , Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin ( 1912 ) , the Armory show in New York ( 1913 ) , SVU M\u00e1nes in Prague ( 1914 ) , several Jack of Diamonds exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring , Amsterdam ( between 1911 and 1915 ) . Futurism developed in response to the work of various artists . Dada subsequently combined these approaches .   Dada activities included public gatherings , demonstrations , and publication of art/literary journals ; passionate coverage of art , politics , and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media . Key figures in the movement included Hugo Ball , Emmy Hennings , Hans Arp , Raoul Hausmann , Hannah H\u00f6ch , Johannes Baader , Tristan Tzara , Francis Picabia , Richard Huelsenbeck , George Grosz , John Heartfield , Marcel Duchamp , Beatrice Wood , Kurt Schwitters , Hans Richter , and Max Ernst , among others . The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements , and groups including surrealism , Nouveau R\u00e9alisme , pop art and Fluxus .   Overview   Dada was an informal international movement , with participants in Europe and North America . The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I . For many participants , the movement was a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests , which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war , and against the cultural and intellectual conformity\u2014in art and more broadly in society\u2014that corresponded to the war .   Many Dadaists believed that the 'reason ' and 'logic ' of bourgeois capitalist society had led people into war . They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace chaos and irrationality . For example , George Grosz later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest `` against this world of mutual destruction . ''   According to Hans Richter Dada was not art : it was `` anti-art . '' Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for . Where art was concerned with traditional aesthetics , Dada ignored aesthetics . If art was to appeal to sensibilities , Dada was intended to offend .   As Hugo Ball expressed it , `` For us , art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in . ''   A reviewer from the American Art News stated at the time that `` Dada philosophy is the sickest , most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man . '' Art historians have described Dada as being , in large part , a `` reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide . ''   Years later , Dada artists described the movement as `` a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis , a savior , a monster , which would lay waste to everything in its path ... [ It was ] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization ... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege .

Serving as the venture 's `` adult supervision '' , Wayne drew the first Apple logo , wrote the three men 's original partnership agreement , and wrote the Apple I manual .   Wayne received a 10 % stake in Apple but relinquished his equity for US $ 800 less than two weeks later , on April 12 , 1976 .

There is no consensus for the beginning date of the Romanesque style , with proposals ranging from the 6th to the late 10th century , this later date being the most commonly held . It developed in the 12th century into the Gothic style , marked by pointed arches . Examples of Romanesque architecture can be found across the continent , making it the first pan-European architectural style since Imperial Roman Architecture . The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as Norman architecture .   Combining features of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings and other local traditions , Romanesque architecture is known by its massive quality , thick walls , round arches , sturdy pillars , groin vaults , large towers and decorative arcading . Each building has clearly defined forms , frequently of very regular , symmetrical plan ; the overall appearance is one of simplicity when compared with the Gothic buildings that were to follow . The style can be identified right across Europe , despite regional characteristics and different materials .   Many castles were built during this period , but they are greatly outnumbered by churches . The most significant are the great abbey churches , many of which are still standing , more or less complete and frequently in use.Bannister Fletcher , A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method . The enormous quantity of churches built in the Romanesque period was succeeded by the still busier period of Gothic architecture , which partly or entirely rebuilt most Romanesque churches in prosperous areas like England and Portugal . The largest groups of Romanesque survivors are in areas that were less prosperous in subsequent periods , including parts of southern France , northern Spain and rural Italy . Survivals of unfortified Romanesque secular houses and palaces , and the domestic quarters of monasteries are far rarer , but these used and adapted the features found in church buildings , on a domestic scale .   Definition   According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word `` Romanesque '' means `` descended from Roman '' and was first used in English to designate what are now called Romance languages ( first cited 1715 ) . The French term `` '' was first used in the architectural sense by archaeologist Charles de Gerville in a letter of 18 December 1818 to Auguste Le Pr\u00e9vost to describe what Gerville sees as a debased Roman architecture . In 1824 Gerville 's friend Arcisse de Caumont adopted the label `` '' to describe the `` degraded '' European architecture from the 5th to the 13th centuries , in his Essai sur l'architecture religieuse du moyen-\u00e2ge , particuli\u00e8rement en Normandie , at a time when the actual dates of many of the buildings so described had not been ascertained : Jean Hubert , Romanesque Art .   The first use in a published work is in William Gunn 's An Inquiry into the Origin and Influence of Gothic Architecture ( London 1819 ) . The word was used by Gunn to describe the style that was identifiably Medieval and prefigured the Gothic , yet maintained the rounded Roman arch and thus appeared to be a continuation of the Roman tradition of building .   The term is now used for the more restricted period from the late 10th to 12th centuries . The term `` Pre-romanesque '' is sometimes applied to architecture in Germany of the Carolingian and Ottonian periods and Visigothic , Mozarab and Asturian constructions between the 8th and the 10th centuries in the Iberian Peninsula while `` First Romanesque '' is applied to buildings in north of Italy and Spain and parts of France that have Romanesque features but pre-date the influence of the Abbey of Cluny .

As Minister for Immigration ( 1949\u20131956 ) , Holt was responsible for the relaxation of the White Australia policy and as Treasurer under Menzies , he initiated major fiscal reforms including the establishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia , and launched and guided the process to convert Australia to decimal currency . As Prime Minister , he oversaw landmark changes including the decision not to devalue the Australian dollar in line with the British pound , and the 1967 constitutional referendum in which an overwhelming majority of Australians voted in favour of giving the Commonwealth power to legislate specifically for indigenous Australians .

Invented in about 1700 ( the exact date is uncertain ) , the piano is widely employed in classical , jazz , traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances , accompaniment , and for composing and rehearsal . Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones . With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed . The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced .   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments . The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe . During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings . By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key . Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case , soundboard , bridge , and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings .   Invention   The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori ( 1655\u20131731 ) of Padua , Italy , who was employed by Ferdinando de ' Medici , Grand Prince of Tuscany , as the Keeper of the Instruments ; he was an expert harpsichord maker , and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments . It is", "modContext": "The piano is a musical instrument played using a keyboard , which is a row of keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key .", "question": "when was basketball invented: 17th, 18th or 19th century?", "groundTruth": "", "answer": "17th, 18th or 19th century", "modAnswer": "19th", "delete sentence number": [" Invented in about 1700 ( the exact date is uncertain ) , the piano is widely employed in classical , jazz , traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances , accompaniment , and for composing and rehearsal .", " Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .", " With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed .", " The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .", "   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments .", " The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe .", " During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings .", " By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed .", " Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case , soundboard , bridge , and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings .", "   Invention   The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori ( 1655\u20131731 ) of Padua , Italy , who was employed by Ferdinando de ' Medici , Grand Prince of Tuscany , as the Keeper of the Instruments ;", " he was an expert harpsichord maker , and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments ."], "distance value": [[1, 0.36296093463897705], [13, 0.3044980466365814], [19, 0.301213800907135], [17, 0.2874612808227539], [18, 0.28279125690460205], [14, 0.2693158984184265], [23, 0.23415212333202362], [20, 0.2180546224117279], [22, 0.18934530019760132], [2, 0.15769025683403015], [3, 0.09543032944202423], [16, 0.08796261250972748], [7, 0.05947674810886383], [6, 0.05498635768890381], [12, 0.049730993807315826], [11, 0.044118791818618774], [0, 0.04237142950296402], [15, 0.034626323729753494], [24, 0.0342709943652153], [5, 0.005446866154670715], [21, -0.002079388126730919], [8, -0.0038146302103996277], [4, -0.017639603465795517], [9, -0.022755511105060577], [10, -0.09889528900384903]]}, {"test case number": 19, "context": "The Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica ( ) is an annual international club football competition organized by CONMEBOL since 1960 .

Concentrated hydrogen peroxide , or `` high-test peroxide '' , is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry .   Hydrogen peroxide is often described as being `` water but with one more oxygen atom '' , a description that can give the incorrect impression of significant chemical similarity between the two compounds . While they have a similar melting point and appearance , pure hydrogen peroxide will explode if heated to boiling , will cause serious contact burns to the skin and can set materials alight on contact . For these reasons it is usually handled as a dilute solution ( household grades are typically 3\u20136 % in the U.S. and somewhat higher in Europe ) . Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond .

In practice hydrogen peroxide will undergo potentially explosive thermal decomposition if heated to this temperature . It may be safely distilled at lower temperatures under reduced pressure .   Aqueous solutions   In aqueous solutions hydrogen peroxide differs from the pure material due to the effects of hydrogen bonding between water and hydrogen peroxide molecules . Hydrogen peroxide and water form a eutectic mixture , exhibiting freezing-point depression ; pure water has a melting point of 0 \u00b0C and pure hydrogen peroxide of \u22120.43 \u00b0C , but a 50 % ( by volume ) solution of the two freezes at \u221251 \u00b0C . The boiling point of the same mixtures is also depressed in relation with the mean of both boiling points ( 125.1 \u00b0C ) . It occurs at 114 \u00b0C . This boiling point is 14 \u00b0C greater than that of pure water and 36.2 \u00b0C less than that of pure hydrogen peroxide .   Structure   Hydrogen peroxide ( ) is a nonplanar molecule with ( twisted ) C2 symmetry . Although the O\u2212O bond is a single bond , the molecule has a relatively high rotational barrier of 2460 cm\u22121 ( 29.45 kJ/mol ) ; for comparison , the rotational barrier for ethane is 12.5 kJ/mol . The increased barrier is ascribed to repulsion between the lone pairs of the adjacent oxygen atoms and results in hydrogen peroxide displaying atropisomerism .   The molecular structures of gaseous and crystalline are significantly different . This difference is attributed to the effects of hydrogen bonding , which is absent in the gaseous state .

It has the highest ( theoretical ) boiling point of this series ( X = O , N , S ) . Its melting point is also fairly high , being comparable to that of hydrazine and water , with only hydroxylamine crystallising significantly more readily , indicative of particularly strong hydrogen bonding . Diphosphane and hydrogen disulfide exhibit only weak hydrogen bonding and have little chemical similarity to hydrogen peroxide . All of these analogues are thermodynamically unstable . Structurally , the analogues all adopt similar skewed structures , due to repulsion between adjacent lone pairs .

Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks , generally made of charred white oak .   Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types . The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains , distillation , and aging in wooden barrels .   Etymology   The word whisky ( or whiskey ) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce ( or uisge ) meaning `` water '' ( now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic , and uisge in Scottish Gaelic ) . Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae ( `` water of life '' ) . This was translated to Classical Gaelic as / `` water of life '' . Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe ( 1581 ) , usquebaugh ( 1610 ) , usquebath ( 1621 ) , and usquebae ( 1715 ) .   Names and spellings   Much is made of the word 's two spellings : whisky and whiskey . There are two schools of thought on the issue . One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word , indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer ( like the difference between color and colour ; or recognize and recognise ) , and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described . There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label , the spelling on the label should not be altered . Some writers refer to `` whisk ( e ) y '' or `` whisky/whiskey '' to acknowledge the variation .   The spelling whiskey is common in Ireland and the United States , while whisky is used in all other whisky producing countries . In the US , the usage has not always been consistent . From the late eighteenth century to the mid twentieth century , American writers used both spellings interchangeably until the introduction of newspaper style guides . Since the 1960s , American writers have increasingly used whiskey as the accepted spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and whisky for aged grain spirits made outside the US . However , some prominent American brands , such as George Dickel , Maker 's Mark , and Old Forester ( all made by different companies ) , use the whisky spelling on their labels , and the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits , the legal regulations for spirit in the US , also use the whisky spelling throughout .   `` Scotch '' is the internationally recognized term for `` Scotch whisky '' .

VIII ( 28 June 1491 \u2013 28 January 1547 ) was King of England from 21 April 1509 until his death . He was the first English King of Ireland , and continued the nominal claim by English monarchs to the Kingdom of France . Henry was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty , succeeding his father , Henry VII .   Henry is known for his consequential role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church , besides his six marriages and many extramarital affairs , as well as his effort to obtain an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon , which led to conflict with the Pope . His disagreements with the Pope led Henry to separate the Church of England from papal authority , with himself as king and as the Supreme Head of the Church of England ; the disputes also led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries . His principal dispute was with papal authority rather than with doctrinal matters , and he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings despite his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church . Henry oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . He is also well known for a long personal rivalry with both Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , with whom he frequently warred .   Domestically , Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution , ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings to England . Besides asserting the sovereign 's supremacy over the Church of England , thus initiating the English Reformation , he greatly expanded royal power . Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent , and those accused were often executed without a formal trial , by means of bills of attainder . He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers , some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour . People such as Thomas Wolsey , Thomas More , Thomas Cromwell , Richard Rich , and Thomas Cranmer figured prominently in Henry 's administration . He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert money into royal revenue that was formerly paid to Rome . Despite the influx of money from these sources , Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars .   His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated , and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne '' . Besides ruling with considerable power , he was also an author and composer . His desire to provide England with a male heir stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly from his belief that a daughter would be unable to consolidate Tudor power and maintain the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses . This led to the two things for which Henry is most remembered : his six marriages and his break with the Pope ( who would not allow an annulment of Henry 's first marriage ) .

Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent , and those accused were often executed without a formal trial , by means of bills of attainder . He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers , some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour .   His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated , and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne '' .

Early 19th century bodhi was translated as `` intelligence '' . The term `` enlighten '' was first being used in 1835 , in an English translation of a French article , while the first recorded use of the term 'enlightenment ' is credited ( by the Oxford English Dictionary ) to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal ( February , 1836 ) .

The Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states , organised through the Commonwealth Secretariat , and non-governmental organisations , organised through the Commonwealth Foundation .   The Commonwealth dates back to the mid-20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories . It was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 , which established the member states as `` free and equal '' . The symbol of this free association is Queen Elizabeth II who is the Head of the Commonwealth . The Queen is also the monarch of 16 members of the Commonwealth , known as Commonwealth realms . The other Commonwealth members have different heads of state : 32 members are republics and five are monarchies with a different monarch .   Member states have no legal obligation to one another . Instead , they are united by language , history , culture and their shared values of democracy , human rights , and the rule of law . These values are enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter and promoted by the quadrennial Commonwealth Games . On 3 October 2013 , after 48 years of membership , The Gambia became the most recent nation to withdraw from the Commonwealth .   The Commonwealth covers more than 29958050 km2 , almost a quarter of the world 's land area , and spans all six inhabited continents . With an estimated population of 2.328 billion , nearly a third of the world population , the Commonwealth in 2014 produced a nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ) of $ 10.45 trillion , representing 17 % of the gross world product when measured in purchasing power parity ( PPP ) and 14 % of the gross world product when measured nominally .   History   Origin   Queen Elizabeth II , in her address to Canada on Dominion Day in 1959 , pointed out that the confederation of Canada on 1 July 1867 had been the birth of the `` first independent country within the British Empire '' . She declared : `` So , it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of Nations . '' As long ago as 1884 , however , Lord Rosebery , while visiting Australia , had described the changing British Empire\u2014as some of its colonies became more independent\u2014as a `` Commonwealth of Nations '' . Conferences of British and colonial prime ministers occurred periodically from the first one in 1887 , leading to the creation of the Imperial Conferences in 1911 .   The Commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences . A specific proposal was presented by Jan Smuts in 1917 when he coined the term `` the British Commonwealth of Nations '' and envisioned the `` future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence '' at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 by delegates from the Dominions as well as Britain . The term first received imperial statutory recognition in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 , when the term British Commonwealth of Nations was substituted for British Empire in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the Irish Free State .   Dominions   In the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference , Britain and its dominions agreed they were `` equal in status , in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs , though united by common allegiance to the Crown , and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations . '' These aspects to the relationship were formalised by the Statute of Westminster in 1931 , which applied to Canada without the need for ratification , but Australia , New Zealand , and Newfoundland had to ratify the statute for it to take effect . Newfoundland never did , as on 16 February 1934 , with the consent of its parliament , the government of Newfoundland voluntarily ended and governance reverted to direct control from London . Newfoundland later joined Canada as its 10th province in 1949 . Australia and New Zealand ratified the Statute in 1942 and 1947 respectively .   Although the Union of South Africa was not among the Dominions that needed to adopt the Statute of Westminster for it to take effect , two laws\u2014the Status of the Union Act , 1934 , and the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act of 1934\u2014were passed to confirm South Africa 's status", "modContext": " It was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 , which established the member states as `` free and equal '' .

That same night , they are visited by Cruella De Vil , a wealthy former schoolmate of Anita 's . She offers to buy the entire litter , but Roger says they are not for sale . A few weeks later , she hires her henchmen , Jasper and Horace , to steal them . When Scotland Yard is unable to find them , Pongo and Perdita use the `` Twilight bark '' , a canine gossip line , to ask for help from the other dogs in London .   Colonel , an old sheepdog , along with his compatriots Captain , a gray horse , and Sergeant Tibbs , a tabby cat , find the puppies in a place called Hell Hall ( Cruella 's abandoned and dilapidated family estate , also known as The De Vil Place ) , along with many other dalmatian puppies that she had bought from various dog stores . When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin fur coats , Colonel quickly sends word back to London . Upon receiving the message , Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies . Winter has come , and they have to cross the Stour River which is running fast and laden with slabs of broken ice . Meanwhile , Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them . In response , Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television , but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house . Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies . While the adult dogs attack them , Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house .   After a happy reunion with their own puppies , Pongo and Perdita realize there are dozens of others with them , 99 altogether including their own . Shocked at Cruella 's plans , they decide to adopt all of them , certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them . They begin making their way back to London through deep snow ; all open water is frozen solid . Other animals help them along the way . Cruella , Jasper , and Horace chase them . In one town , they cover themselves with soot so they appear to be labrador retrievers , then pile inside a moving van bound for London . As it is leaving , melting snow clears off the soot and Cruella sees them .

Aside from its box office revenue , its commercial success was due to the employment of inexpensive animation techniques\u2014such as using xerography during the process of inking and painting traditional animation cels\u2014that kept production costs down .

In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms , united by \u00c6thelstan ( r. 927\u2013939 ) , became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre .   Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066\u20131154 , Plantagenet 1154\u20131485 , Tudor 1485\u20131603 and Stuart 1603\u20131714 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649\u20131660 ) .  Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became `` more English in nature '' ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor .   The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327\u20131377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government\u2014in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558\u20131603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World .   From the accession of James I in 1603 , the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland . Under the Stuarts , the kingdom plunged into civil war , which culminated in the execution of Charles I in 1649 . The monarchy returned in 1660 , but the Civil War established the precedent that an English monarch can not govern without the consent of Parliament , although this concept became legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 .  From this time the kingdom of England , as well as its successor state the United Kingdom , functioned in effect as a constitutional monarchy.The Constitution of the United Kingdom , with the reservation that it is `` uncodified '' , is taken to be based in the Bill of Rights 1689 .

family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times . Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world , being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable . They have numerous varieties , varying in size , flavor , color , and length of time they take to mature . Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants , including glucosinolate , myrosinase , and isothiocyanate . They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases . They germinate quickly and grow rapidly , smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month , while larger daikon varieties take several months . Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop . Some radishes are grown for their seeds ; daikon , for instance , may be grown for oil production . Others are used for sprouting and both roots and leaves are sometimes served cooked or cold .   History   Varieties of radish are now broadly distributed around the world , but almost no archeological records are available to help determine their early history and domestication . However , scientists tentatively locate the origin of Raphanus sativus in southeast Asia , as this is the only region where truly wild forms have been discovered . India , central China , and central Asia appear to have been secondary centers where differing forms were developed . Radishes enter the historical record in . Greek and Roman agriculturalists of the gave details of small , large , round , long , mild , and sharp varieties . The radish seems to have been one of the first European crops introduced to the Americas . A German botanist reported radishes of 100 lb and roughly 3 ft in length in 1544 , although the only variety of that size today is the Japanese Sakurajima radish . The large , mild , and white East Asian form was developed in China , but is mostly associated in the West with the Japanese daikon , owing to Japanese agricultural development and larger exports .   Description   Radishes are annual or biennial brassicaceous crops grown for their swollen tap roots which can be globular , tapering , or cylindrical .

Best quality roots are obtained under moderate day lengths with air temperatures in the range 50 to . Under average conditions , the crop matures in 3\u20134 weeks , but in colder weather , 6\u20137 weeks may be required .   Radishes grow best in full sun in light , sandy loams , with a soil pH 6.5 to 7.0 , but for late-season crops , a clayey-loam is ideal . Soils that bake dry and form a crust in dry weather are unsuitable and can impair germination . Harvesting periods can be extended by making repeat plantings , spaced a week or two apart . In warmer climates , radishes are normally planted in the autumn . The depth at which seeds are planted affects the size of the root , from 1 cm deep recommended for small radishes to 4 cm for large radishes .

However , the Rec remains part of the floodplain at risk of occasional flooding . The ground can still get very boggy after heavy rains .   History   In the early part of the 1890s , the land on which the Recreation Ground now lies as well as the North Parade land were part of the Bathwick Estate , which was owned by the Forester family . In 1894 , a lease was granted to the Directors of The Bath and County Recreation Ground Company Limited by Captain G W Forester . This lease allowed work to be carried out on the land which would make it suitable for cricket matches , lawn tennis and archery tournaments , football matches and all other outdoor sports . As part of this work , a cricket pavilion was started on the north side of the ground . The first Bath rugby matches were also played on the ground in 1884 . Three years later , the ground hosted its maiden first-class cricket match , with Somerset County Cricket Club hosting the Gentlemen of Philadelphia as part of the Bath Cricket Festival . The company 's lease was extended for a further 21 years in 1908 , at a rent of \u00a3100 per year . Fourteen years later , the land was conveyed to The Bath and County Recreation Ground Company Limited for \u00a36,050 . The company then conveyed the North Parade Land , including a building which was used as an ice skating rink , to Bath Artcraft Limited for \u00a32,500 .   A new lease was granted to Bath F.C . in 1927 , allowing them the use of the land on the west side of ground , along with a Grand Stand , a New ( North ) Stand and a Pavilion , for a term of 25 years . Six years later the lease was surrendered , and a new 50-year lease was granted . In the same year , the Grand Stand was replaced with a new West Stand . This was significantly bomb-damaged during the Second World War . Rebuilding of the stand , at a cost in excess of \u00a312,000 , was met by the War Damage Commission in 1953\u201354 . The 'Club Room ' building was erected in 1954 , to the west of the North Stand , and during the same year a lease was granted to allow a tennis club to use the north east corner of the ground . In 1956 , the ground was conveyed to the Mayor Aldermen and the Citizens of the City of Bath ( the Corporation ) for \u00a311,155 .   Bath F.C . surrendered their 1933 lease , and were granted a new 75-year lease in 1973 .

ravens , rooks , jackdaws , jays , magpies , treepies , choughs , and nutcrackers . In common English , they are known as the crow family , or , more technically , corvids . Over 120 species are described . The genus Corvus , including the jackdaws , crows , and ravens , makes up over a third of the entire family .   They are considered the most intelligent of the birds , and among the most intelligent of all animals , having demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests ( European magpies ) and tool-making ability ( crows , rooks ) \u2014skills until recently regarded as solely the province of humans and a few other higher mammals . Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to that of great apes and cetaceans , and only slightly lower than in humans .   They are medium to large in size , with strong feet and bills , rictal bristles , and a single moult each year ( most passerines moult twice ) . Corvids are found worldwide except for the tip of South America and the polar ice caps . The majority of the species are found in tropical South and Central America , southern Asia and Eurasia , with fewer than 10 species each in Africa and Australasia . The genus Corvus has re-entered Australia in relatively recent geological prehistory , with five species and one subspecies there .   Systematics , taxonomy , and evolution   Over the years , much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives . What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world . Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse , but often Australasian groups . In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s , Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida , based on DNA-DNA hybridization . The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs , birds of paradise , whipbirds , quail-thrushes , whistlers , monarch flycatchers and drongos , shrikes , vireos , and vangas , but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial . The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea , together with their closest relatives ( the birds of paradise , Australian mud-nesters and shrikes ) . They are also the core group of the Corvida , which includes the related groups , such as orioles and vireos .   Clarification of the interrelationships of the corvids has been achieved based on cladistic analysis of several DNA sequences . The jays and magpies do not constitute monophyletic lineages , but rather seem to split up into an American and Old World lineage , and an Holarctic and Oriental lineage , respectively . These are not closely related among each other . The position of the azure-winged magpie , which has always been a major enigma , is even less clear than before .

''   Wallace 's military career included service in the Mexican\u2013American War and the American Civil War . He was appointed Indiana 's adjutant general and commanded the 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment . Wallace , who attained the rank of major general , participated in the Battle of Fort Donelson , the Battle of Shiloh , and the Battle of Monocacy . He also served on the military commission for the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators , and presided over the trial of Henry Wirz , the Confederate commandant of the Andersonville prison camp .   Wallace resigned from the U.S. Army in November 1865 and briefly served as a major general in the Mexican army , before returning to the United States . Wallace was appointed governor of the New Mexico Territory ( 1878\u201381 ) and served as U.S. minister to the Ottoman Empire ( 1881\u201385 ) .

Lew began his formal education at the age of six at a public school in Covington , but he much preferred the outdoors . Wallace had a talent for drawing and loved to read , but he was a discipline problem at school . In 1836 , at the age of nine , Lew joined his older brother in Crawfordsville , Indiana , where he briefly attended Wabash Preparatory School , but soon transferred to another school more suitable for his age . In 1840 , when Wallace was thirteen , his father sent him to a private academy at Centerville , Indiana , where his teacher encouraged Lew 's natural affinity for writing . Wallace returned to Indianapolis the following year.Gronert , p. 71 .   Sixteen-year-old Lew went out to earn his own wages in 1842 , after his father refused to pay for more schooling . Wallace found a job copying records at the Marion County clerk 's office and lived in an Indianapolis boardinghouse . He also joined the Marion Rifles , a local militia unit , and began writing his first novel , The Fair God , but it was not published until 1873 . Wallace acknowledged in his autobiography that he had never been a member of any organized religion , but he did believe `` in the Christian conception of God '' .

Common symptoms are a stuffy nose , runny nose , sneezing , and post-nasal drip .   In rhinitis , the inflammation of the mucous membrane is caused by viruses , bacteria , irritants or allergens . The most common kind of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis , which is usually triggered by airborne allergens such as pollen and dander . Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms , such as sneezing and nasal itching , coughing , headache , fatigue , malaise , and cognitive impairment . The allergens may also affect the eyes , causing watery , reddened , or itchy eyes and puffiness around the eyes . The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of mucus , commonly producing a runny nose , as well as a stuffy nose and post-nasal drip . In the case of allergic rhinitis , the inflammation is caused by the degranulation of mast cells in the nose . When mast cells degranulate , they release histamine and other chemicals , starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose , such as fatigue and malaise . In the case of infectious rhinitis , it may occasionally lead to pneumonia , either viral pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia . Sneezing also occurs in infectious rhinitis to expel bacteria and viruses from the respiratory system .   Rhinitis is very common . Allergic rhinitis is more common in some countries than others ; in the United States , about 10 % \u201330 % of adults are affected annually .   Types   Rhinitis is categorized into three types ( although infectious rhinitis is typically regarded as a separate clinical entity due to its transient nature ) : ( i ) infectious rhinitis includes acute and chronic bacterial infections ; ( ii ) nonallergic ( vasomotor ) rhinitis includes idiopathic , hormonal , atrophic , occupational , and gustatory rhinitis , as well as rhinitis medicamentosa ( drug-induced ) ; ( iii ) allergic rhinitis , triggered by pollen , mold , animal dander , dust , Balsam of Peru , and other inhaled allergens .   Infectious   Rhinitis is commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection , including the common cold , which is caused by Rhinoviruses , Coronaviruses , and influenza viruses , others caused by adenoviruses , human parainfluenza viruses , human respiratory syncytial virus , enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses , metapneumovirus , and measles virus , or bacterial sinusitis , which is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and Moraxella catarrhalis . Symptoms of the common cold include rhinorrhea , sneezing , sore throat ( pharyngitis ) , cough , congestion , and slight headache .   Nonallergic rhinitis   Nonallergic rhinitis refers to rhinitis that is not due to an allergy . It was formerly known as vasomotor rhinitis as the cause was thought to be vasodilation caused by an overactive parasympathetic nerve response . It is now encompassed under the more general classification of nonallergic rhinitis . The diagnosis is made upon excluding allergic causes . It is an umbrella term of rhinitis of multiple causes , such as occupational ( chemical ) , smoking , gustatory , hormonal , senile ( rhinitis of the elderly ) , atrophic , medication-induced ( including rhinitis medicamentosa ) , local allergic rhinitis , non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome ( NARES ) and idiopathic ( vasomotor or non-allergic , non-infectious perennial allergic rhinitis ( NANIPER ) , or non-infectious non-allergic rhinitis ( NINAR ) .   In vasomotor rhinitis , certain nonspecific stimuli , including changes in environment ( temperature , humidity , barometric pressure , or weather ) , airborne irritants ( odors , fumes ) , dietary factors ( spicy food , alcohol ) , sexual arousal , exercise , and emotional factors trigger rhinitis . There is still much to be learned about this , but it is thought that these non-allergic triggers cause dilation of the blood vessels in the lining of the nose , which results in swelling and drainage .   Non-allergic rhinitis can co-exist with allergic rhinitis , and is referred to as `` mixed rhinitis . '' The pathology of vasomotor rhinitis appears to involve neurogenic inflammation and is as yet not very well understood . Vasomotor rhinitis appears to be significantly more common in women than men , leading some researchers to believe that hormones play a role .

restaurants with locations primarily in the American Southwest and Pacific coast .

The chain is currently headquartered in Irvine , California and has slowly expanded outside Southern California into the rest of California , as well as into Arizona , Nevada , Utah , Texas , and Oregon . The current owner is Lynsi Snyder , the Snyders ' only grandchild .   As the chain has expanded , it has opened several distribution centers in addition to its original Baldwin Park location . The new facilities , located in Lathrop , California ; Phoenix , Arizona ; Draper , Utah ; and Dallas , Texas will provide for potential future expansion into other parts of the country .   In-N-Out Burger has resisted franchising its operations or going public ; one reason is the prospect of quality or customer consistency being compromised by excessively rapid business growth . The company 's business practices have been noted for employee-centered personnel policies . For example , In-N-Out is one of the few fast food chains in the United States to pay its employees more than state and federally mandated minimum wage guidelines \u2013 starting at US $ 9.25 per hour in California , as of August 2001 . The In-N-Out restaurant chain has developed a highly loyal customer base , and has been rated as one of the top fast food restaurants in several customer satisfaction surveys .   History   First generation   In-N-Out 's first location was opened in the Los Angeles suburb of Baldwin Park , California in 1948 by the Snyders at the southwest corner of what is now the intersection of Interstate 10 and Francisquito Avenue . The restaurant was the first drive-thru hamburger stand in California , allowing drivers to place orders via a two-way speaker system . This was a new and unique idea , since in post-World War II California , carhops were used to take orders and serve food . According to the company 's website , the Snyders had a simple plan that is still in use today : `` Give customers the freshest , highest quality foods you can buy and provide them with friendly service in a sparkling clean environment . ''   A second In-N-Out was opened west of the intersection of Grand Avenue and Arrow Highway in Covina , California , three years later . The company remained a relatively small southern California chain until the 1970s . The Snyders managed their first restaurants closely to ensure quality was maintained . The chain had 18 restaurants when Harry Snyder died in 1976 , at the age of 63 .   Second generation   In 1976 , 24-year-old Rich Snyder became the company president after his father 's death . Along with his brother Guy , Rich had reportedly begun working in his father 's In-N-Outs `` from the ground floor '' at an early age . Over the next 20 years , the chain experienced a period of rapid growth under Rich 's leadership , expanding to 93 restaurants .   The first location outside of the Los Angeles metropolitan area was opened in San Diego County in 1990 , the 61st location in the chain . In 1992 , In-N-Out opened its first non-Southern California restaurant in Las Vegas , Nevada . Its first Northern California location was opened the following year in Modesto . Expansion then spread to Northern California , including the San Francisco Bay Area , while additional Las Vegas-area restaurants were added . However , after opening the 83rd In-N-Out restaurant in Fresno , California , on December 15 , 1993 , Rich Snyder and four other passengers died in a plane crash on approach to John Wayne Airport in Orange County , California . The charter aircraft they were on had been following a Boeing 757 in for landing , became caught in its wake turbulence , and crashed . The ensuing crash investigation led to the Federal Aviation Administration requirement for an adequate distance between heavy aircraft and following light aircraft to allow wake turbulence to diminish .   Upon Rich Snyder 's death in 1993 , Guy Snyder assumed the presidency and continued the company 's aggressive expansion until he died from an overdose of painkillers in 1999 .

In a minority of systems , notably in semi-presidential systems of government , a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state .

Louis XIV and his descendants generally attempted to avoid giving this title to their chief ministers .   The term prime minister in the sense that we know it originated in the 18th century in the United Kingdom when members of parliament disparagingly used the title in reference to Sir Robert Walpole . Over time , the title became honorific and remains so in the 21st century .   History   Origins   The monarchs of England and the United Kingdom had ministers in whom they placed special trust and who were regarded as the head of the government . Examples were Thomas Cromwell under Henry VIII ; William Cecil , Lord Burghley under Elizabeth I ; Clarendon under Charles II and Godolphin under Queen Anne . These ministers held a variety of formal posts , but were commonly known as `` the minister '' , the `` chief minister '' , the `` first minister '' and finally the `` prime minister '' .   The power of these ministers depended entirely on the personal favour of the monarch . Although managing the parliament was among the necessary skills of holding high office , they did not depend on a parliamentary majority for their power . Although there was a cabinet , it was appointed entirely by the monarch , and the monarch usually presided over its meetings .   When the monarch grew tired of a first minister , he or she could be dismissed , or worse : Cromwell was executed and Clarendon driven into exile when they lost favour . Kings sometimes divided power equally between two or more ministers to prevent one minister from becoming too powerful . Late in Anne 's reign , for example , the Tory ministers Harley and St John shared power .   Development   In the mid 17th century , after the English Civil War ( 1642\u20131651 ) , Parliament strengthened its position relative to the monarch then gained more power through the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 . The monarch could no longer establish any law or impose any tax without its permission and thus the House of Commons became a part of the government .

With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1 , 2015 , it is Canada 's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada 's three prairie provinces . Its area is about . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1 , 1905 . The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015 .   Alberta is bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east , the Northwest Territories to the north , and the U.S. state of Montana to the south . Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than to areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming .   Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , oil sands ( Athabasca oil sands ) and other northern resource industries .   About 290 km south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta . Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta 's two census metropolitan areas , both of which have populations exceeding one million , while the province has 16 census agglomerations . Tourist destinations in the province include Banff , Canmore , Drumheller , Jasper and Sylvan Lake .   Etymology   Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta ( 1848\u20131939 ) , the fourth daughter of Victoria , Queen of Canada , and Albert , Prince Consort . Princess Louise was the wife of John Campbell , Marquess of Lorne , Governor General of Canada ( 1878\u201383 ) . Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour .   Geography   Alberta , with an area of 661848 km2 , is the fourth largest province after Quebec , Ontario , and British Columbia . To the south , the province borders on the 49th parallel north , separating it from the US state of Montana , while on the north the 60th parallel north divides it from the Northwest Territories . To the east , the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan , while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60\u00b0N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains , and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49\u00b0N .   The province extends 1223 km north to south and 660 km east to west at its maximum width . Its highest point is 3747 m at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border , while its lowest point is 152 m on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast .   With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the southeastern section , the province has adequate water resources . There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming , fishing and a range of water sports . There are three large lakes , Lake Claire ( 1436 km2 ) in Wood Buffalo National Park , Lesser Slave Lake ( 1168 km2 ) , and Lake Athabasca ( 7898 km2 ) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan . The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels 1538 km from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca . The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3/s . The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River , a tributary of the Mackenzie River .   Alberta 's capital city , Edmonton , is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province . It is the most northerly major city in Canada , and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada . The region , with its proximity to Canada 's largest oil fields , has most of western Canada 's oil refinery capacity . Calgary is located approximately 280 km south of Edmonton and 240 km north of Montana , surrounded by extensive ranching country .

R. Cash ; February 26 , 1932 \u2013 September 12 , 2003 ) was an American singer-songwriter , guitarist , actor , and author , who was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time , having sold more than 90 million records worldwide . Although primarily remembered as a country music icon , his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll , rockabilly , blues , folk , and gospel . This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music , Rock and Roll , and Gospel Music Halls of Fame .   Cash was known for his deep , calm bass-baritone voice , the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band , a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor , free prison concerts , and a trademark look , which earned him the nickname `` The Man in Black '' . He traditionally began his concerts with the simple `` Hello , I 'm Johnny Cash '' , followed by his signature `` Folsom Prison Blues '' .   Much of Cash 's music echoed themes of sorrow , moral tribulation and redemption , especially in the later stages of his career . His best-known songs included `` I Walk the Line '' , `` Folsom Prison Blues '' , `` Ring of Fire '' , `` Get Rhythm '' and `` Man in Black '' . He also recorded humorous numbers like `` One Piece at a Time '' and `` A Boy Named Sue '' ; a duet with his future wife , June Carter , called `` Jackson '' ( followed by many further duets after their marriage ) ; and railroad songs including `` Hey , Porter '' , `` Orange Blossom Special '' and `` Rock Island Line '' . During the last stage of his career , Cash covered songs by several late 20th century rock artists , most notably `` Hurt '' by Nine Inch Nails .   Early life and influences   Cash was born on February 26 , 1932 , in Kingsland , Arkansas , one of seven children born to Ray Cash ( May 13 , 1897 , Kingsland , Arkansas \u2013 December 23 , 1985 , Hendersonville , Tennessee ) and Carrie Cloveree ( n\u00e9e Rivers ; March 13 , 1904 , Rison , Arkansas \u2013 March 11 , 1991 , Hendersonville , Tennessee ) .  He was mostly of Scottish and English ancestry , and as an adult traced his surname to 11th-century Fife , Scotland , after meeting with the then-laird of Falkland , Fife , Major Michael Crichton-Stuart . Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the name of his family .   At birth , Cash was named J. R. Cash . When Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force , he was not permitted to use initials as a first name , so he changed his name to John R. Cash . In 1955 , when signing with Sun Records , he took Johnny Cash as his stage name .   The Cash children were : Roy , Margaret Louise , Jack , J. R. , Reba , Joanne , and Tommy . Tommy Cash also became a successful country artist . In March 1935 , when Cash was three years old , the family settled in Dyess , Arkansas . He started working in cotton fields at age five , singing along with his family while working . The family farm was flooded on at least two occasions , which later inspired him to write the song `` Five Feet High and Rising '' . His family 's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs , especially those about other people facing similar difficulties .   Cash was very close to his older brother , Jack . In May 1944 , Jack was pulled into a whirling head saw in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two . He suffered for over a week before he died on May 20 , 1944 , at age 15 . Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident . According to Cash : The Autobiography , his father was away that morning , but he and his mother , and Jack himself , all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day , causing his mother to urge Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother .

It remains one of the world 's worst football disasters . It happened during the 1988\u201389 FA Cup semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest , being played at the neutral venue of Hillsborough , home ground of Sheffield Wednesday . The disaster resulted in a number of safety improvements in the largest football grounds , notably the elimination of standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadia , and the removal of spectator fencing , introduced to prevent pitch invasions . Initial investigations attached most of the blame to the police , but the coroner 's inquest ruled the deaths as accidental and no prosecutions followed . Aggrieved relatives launched a campaign for truth and justice , initially rebuffed , but eventually succeeding in gaining a new inquest verdict in 2016 , exonerating fans of any blame and recording a verdict of unlawful killing .   The crush occurred in the two central pens in the Leppings Lane stand , allocated to Liverpool fans ; in an attempt to ease overcrowding outside the entrance turnstiles shortly before kick-off , the police match commander chief superintendent David Duckenfield had ordered an exit gate to be opened , leading to a sudden influx of around 2,000 supporters through a tunnel leading to the central pens , trapping spectators already in the pens , with fences to their front and sides . With the kick-off due at 3 pm , the gate was opened 2:52 pm ; by 3:06 pm the game had been stopped .   Many of the myths about the disaster emerged in the following days , as police fed false stories to the press , resulting in the headline `` The Truth '' in the national tabloid newspaper The Sun . These persisted even after the Taylor Report of 1990 , which found the main reason for the disaster was a failure of control by South Yorkshire Police ( SYP ) , and that fans ' behaviour played no part in it . Despite Taylor criticising the police 's attempts to shift blame , the Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution against individuals or institutions . Families strongly rejected the coroner 's subsequent ruling , disagreeing with his decision not to examine events after 3.15 pm .

Biography   Douglas was born in Florence , Italy , the eldest son of Scottish Conservative Party politician Archibald , Viscount Drumlanrig and Caroline Margaret Clayton . He was briefly styled Viscount Drumlanrig following his father 's succession in 1856 , and on his father 's death in 1858 he inherited the Marquessate of Queensberry . The 9th Marquess was educated in the training ships Illustrious and Britannia at Portsmouth , and served in the Royal Navy until resigning in 1864 . He was Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 1st Dumfriesshire Rifle Volunteers from 1869 to 1871 .   In 1864 he entered Magdalene College , Cambridge , which he left two years later without taking a degree . He was more distinguished in sport , playing college cricket as well as running , hunting and steeplechasing . Article by John Davis .   He married Sibyl Montgomery in 1866 . They had four sons and a daughter ; his wife successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his adultery . She survived him to the age of 90 , dying in 1935 . The daughter , who became Lady Edith Gertrude Douglas , married the inventor St. George Lane Fox-Pitt . Queensberry married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year .   He died , two months after a stroke , and after a period of mental decline believed to be caused by syphilis , in his club room in Welbeck Street , west London , aged 55 , nearly a year before Oscar Wilde 's death . He wrote a poem starting with the words `` When I am dead cremate me . '' After cremation at Woking Crematorium his ashes were buried in Scotland in the family burial ground at Kinmount , Dumfriesshire .   In a surprising turn of events , for a man famed for his atheism and secularism , he apparently confessed his love for Christ and was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed , at his own request .   His eldest son and heir apparent was Francis , Viscount Drumlanrig , who was rumoured to have been engaged in a homosexual relationship with the Liberal Prime Minister , Archibald Primrose , 5th Earl of Rosebery . He died unmarried and without issue .   Douglas ' second son , Lord Percy Douglas ( 1868\u20131920 ) , succeeded to the peerage instead . Lord Alfred `` Bosie '' Douglas , the third son , was the close friend and lover of the famous author and poet Oscar Wilde . Queensberry 's efforts to end that relationship led to his famous dispute with Wilde .   Contributions to sports   Queensberry was a patron of sport and a noted boxing enthusiast . In 1866 he was one of the founders of the Amateur Athletic Club , now the Amateur Athletic Association of England , one of the first groups that did not require amateur athletes to belong to the upper-classes in order to compete . The following year the Club published a set of twelve rules for conducting boxing matches . The rules had been drawn up by John Graham Chambers but appeared under Queensberry 's sponsorship and are universally known as the `` Marquess of Queensberry rules '' .   A keen rider , Queensberry was also active in fox hunting and owned several successful race horses . As a rider his first winner was in the Dumfriesshire Hunt Club chase in 1865 , and his last was at Sandown Park in 1883 . He was Master of the Worcester Fox Hounds in 1870 . He was on the committee of the National Hunt but never won a Grand National as a rider , a last-minute substitution on the victorious `` Old Joe '' keeping him out of the 1886 National . During his riding career he recovered from a series of serious injuries .   Political career   In 1872 , Queensberry was chosen by the Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords as a representative peer . He served as such until 1880 , when he was again nominated but refused to take the religious oath of allegiance to the Sovereign . Viewed by some as an outspoken atheist , he declared that he would not participate in", "modContext": " He was briefly styled Viscount Drumlanrig following his father 's succession in 1856 , and on his father 's death in 1858 he inherited the Marquessate of Queensberry . The 9th Marquess was educated in the training ships Illustrious and Britannia at Portsmouth , and served in the Royal Navy until resigning in 1864 . He was Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 1st Dumfriesshire Rifle Volunteers from 1869 to 1871 .   In 1864 he entered Magdalene College , Cambridge , which he left two years later without taking a degree .   He married Sibyl Montgomery in 1866 . They had four sons and a daughter ; his wife successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his adultery . She survived him to the age of 90 , dying in 1935 . Queensberry married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year .   He died , two months after a stroke , and after a period of mental decline believed to be caused by syphilis , in his club room in Welbeck Street , west London , aged 55 , nearly a year before Oscar Wilde 's death . He wrote a poem starting with the words `` When I am dead cremate me . '' After cremation at Woking Crematorium his ashes were buried in Scotland in the family burial ground at Kinmount , Dumfriesshire .   In a surprising turn of events , for a man famed for his atheism and secularism , he apparently confessed his love for Christ and was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed , at his own request .   His eldest son and heir apparent was Francis , Viscount Drumlanrig , who was rumoured to have been engaged in a homosexual relationship with the Liberal Prime Minister , Archibald Primrose , 5th Earl of Rosebery . He died unmarried and without issue . He was Master of the Worcester Fox Hounds in 1870 .   Political career   In 1872 , Queensberry was chosen by the Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords as a representative peer .

Influenced by classic rock bands such as Pink Floyd , The Who , Led Zeppelin , AC/DC and Sex Pistols , Jones is noted for his raspy voice , which has been described as `` whiskey '' and has drawn criticism as well as acclaim . As a lyricist , Jones is influenced by Neil Young , Bob Catley , Steve Perry , Bob Dylan and Otis Redding .   History   Early life and d\u00e9but   Jones lived in the village of Cwmaman , near Aberdare , where he became friends with neighbours , Stuart Cable and Richard Jones and they formed a covers band together . Showing a talent for writing in his youth , he considered being a scriptwriter before being a musician and studied film at college . The BBC showed an interest in some of his early work but , as the band progressed from a cover band to writing their original material , he decided to use his narrative side more towards writing lyrics . Jones also flirted with the idea of boxing as a career and was a successful boxer at youth level . Much of his early life is documented in Stereophonics ' debut album , including his account of his teen years on a market stall . These are documented in `` More Life in a Tramps Vest '' from Stereophonics ' first album released in 1997 , Word Gets Around .   In 1999 Stereophonics were the first band to be signed to Richard Branson 's new Virgin Records label V2 . Their debut EP Looks Like Chaplin did not have enough copies made to enter the charts and their next single Local Boy in the Photograph was one place shy of making the UK Top 50 . However , their debut LP Word Gets Around did , however , make it to number 6 on the UK Albums Chart . Fellow Welsh band Manic Street Preachers put the band as support on their 1996-97 tour .   1998 - present : Mainstream success   In February 1998 , they received a Brit Award for Best New Group , the same week as a re-issue of Local Boy in the Photograph made number 14 in the charts and their first album went gold in the UK , selling over 100,000 copies . During that year Stereophonics had tours in Europe , Australia and the USA . They performed a concert on 12 June 1998 at Cardiff Castle . They performed a cover of the Randy Newman song Mama Told Me Not to Come with Tom Jones for his album Reload .   After another tour , they re-entered the studios and recorded Just Enough Education to Perform , containing the single Mr . Writer and Have a Nice Day , and Step on My Old Size Nines . A cover of Rod Stewart 's version of Mike D'Abo 's song Handbags & Gladrags was added to later editions of the album . They also recorded their biggest audience to date when they played to 80,000 in Slane Castle in Ireland and ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium , Cardiff , supported by Feeder and Ocean Colour Scene - who they had supported years before .   They released their fourth studio album You Got ta Go There to Come Back with songs like Maybe Tomorrow and Madame Helga and a re-worked song that had not been completed in time - Moviestar . They re-issued the album with this track included .   In 2002 , the band was chosen as a support act for Counting Crows and toured on various UK dates with the band . Subsequently Jones would join the band on stage and perform Mr. Jones and Hanginaround alongside Adam Duritz .   In 2003 , whilst on tour in Germany , drummer Stuart Cable - whom by this time had his own television chat show on BBC Wales - was sacked from the band by Jones , citing problems over `` commitment '' . Cable was replaced temporarily on the remainder of the tour by Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman . According to Stuart , `` I kept pluggin ' away .

This battle put an end to the first French invasion of Portugal .   Four days after the Battle of Roli\u00e7a , Wellesley 's army was attacked by a French army under General Junot near the village of Vimeiro . The battle began as a battle of manoeuvre , with French troops attempting to outflank the British left , but Wellesley was able to redeploy his army to face the assault . Meanwhile , Junot sent in two central columns but these were forced back by sustained volleys from troops in line . Soon afterwards , the flanking attack was beaten off and Junot retreated towards Torres Vedras having lost 2,000 men and 13 cannon , compared to 700 Anglo-Portuguese losses . No pursuit was attempted because Wellesley was superseded by Sir Harry Burrard and then Sir Hew Dalrymple ( one having arrived during the battle , the second soon after ) .   Prelude   After Roli\u00e7a , Wellesley had established a position near Vimeiro . By holding the village , plus some ridges to the west , the British commander covered a beachhead at Maceira Bay a little further to the west . Since most of his reinforcements had arrived by 20 August , Wellesley planned to advance south on Lisbon . Eight independent infantry brigades under Rowland Hill , Ronald Fergusson , Miles Nightingall , Barnard Bowes , Catlin Craufurd , Henry Fane , Robert Anstruther and Wroth Acland formed the core of Wellesley 's forces . Rounding out his force were 17 cannons , 240 light cavalry led by C. D. Taylor and about 2,000 Portuguese troops under Nicholas Trant , giving a total of 20,000 men .   Junot organised his 14,000-man force into two infantry divisions and a cavalry division under Pierre Margaron . Henri Fran\u00e7ois Delaborde 's infantry division contained two brigades under Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Brenier and Jean Guillaume Barth\u00e9lemy Thomi\u00e8res , while Louis Henri Loison 's division included two brigades commanded by Jean-Baptiste Solignac and Hugues Charlot . In addition , Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne de Kellermann commanded a 2,100-man reserve made up of four converged grenadier battalions . These units were created by taking the grenadier company from each of Junot 's infantry battalions . The French took 23 cannons into battle with them .   Wellesley placed Anstruther 's and Fane 's brigades in front of Vimeiro , with Acland 's men in support . At first , his five remaining brigades held only the western ridge . Junot planned to send Thomieres , Solignac and Charlot 's infantry brigades to capture Vimeiro , while Brenier 's 4,300-man brigade and some dragoons swung in a wide flanking manoeuvre to seize an empty ridge to the northeast of the village . Wellesley detected Brenier 's move and switched Nightingall , Fergusson and Bowes to the northeastern ridge . Once Junot realised that British troops occupied the ridge , he sent Solignac 's brigade to the right to assist Brenier 's attack . The French commander decided to launch his attack on the town immediately , instead of waiting for his flanking move to develop .   Battle   All the preliminary moves and countermoves caused a series of uncoordinated French attacks . First , Thomieres ' 2,100-man brigade approached the British position . Supported by three cannons and screened by skirmishers , the brigade was formed into a column of companies .   The first company of 120 men formed in a three-deep line would have a front rank 40 men wide . All the other companies formed behind the first company , making the entire brigade about 40 files wide and 48 ranks deep . According to French doctrine , as soon as the enemy main position was found , the companies would peel off to the right or left to form a firing line many companies wide and only three files deep . On the other hand , French commanders often pressed home attacks while in column , depending entirely upon their skirmishers and artillery to provide the necessary fire support .   To counter the French skirmishers , Fane detached four companies of riflemen ( 60th Regiment of Foot & 95th Rifles ) . These outnumbered and outfought the French skirmishers , who fell back to the sides of the brigade column . Without their skirmishers in front of them , the French column blundered into the 945 men of the 50th Regiment .", "modContext": " This battle put an end to the first French invasion of Portugal .

The Who developed from an earlier group , the Detours , and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements , featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage . Their first single as the Who , `` I Ca n't Explain '' , reached the UK top ten , followed by a string of singles including `` My Generation '' , `` Substitute '' and `` Happy Jack '' . In 1967 , they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single `` I Can See for Miles '' , while touring extensively . The group 's fourth album , 1969 's rock opera Tommy , included the single `` Pinball Wizard '' and was a critical and commercial success .

St Blaise is the civil parish in which St Blazey is situated ; the name St Blaise is also used by the town council . The village of Biscovey and the settlements of St Blazey Gate , Bodelva and West Par lie within the parish boundaries . An electoral ward also exists in the name of St Blaise . The population at the 2011 census was 4,674 .  Once an important engineering centre for the local mine and railway industries , the parish is now dominated by the Eden Project .   St Blazey is situated 3 mi east of St Austell , 1 mi west of Tywardreath and 1 mi north of Par .   The town takes its name from the Armenian Saint Blaise and holds a procession and service on his feast day , 3 February .   History   An Iron Age hillfort Prideaux Castle lies a mile to the north west of the town in the parish of Luxulyan .   The Biscovey Stone is the shaft of an ancient Celtic cross . It was inscribed , but the text is no longer readable . There are several theories about the stone ; one says it dates from around 600 AD to show the Saxon advance into the county , another puts the date at around 900 AD . The head is thought to have been removed during the Reformation . The stone served as a gate post near the St Blazey turnpike gate . In 1896 it was moved to St Mary 's Church , Biscovey .   The church was built between 1440 and 1445 and is dedicated to Saint Blaise . It replaces an earlier church mentioned in 1294 . The parish was administered by Tywardreath Priory until the Reformation . It was split from St Austell parish in 1834 .  The site was originally known by the Cornish names Landrait or Landreath , meaning Church on the Sand .   Until the 16th century the valley below St Blazey was an estuary of the River Par and the St Blazey was the lowest crossing point on the river . Tin mining up river caused the estuary to silt up and it had become marsh land by the early 19th century . The Par Canal was built by Joseph Treffry between 1829 and 1835 ; it forms part of the boundary with the parish of Tywardreath and Par .   The town was once dominated by the local mining industries and their associated transport infrastructure . Historically copper and tin were mined in and around the parish , whilst more recently china clay has been the principal commodity mined . `` The Par & St Blazey Consols '' or `` South Prideaux Wood '' was a small tin mine just north of the town and Par Consols Mine lies to the south west . The more extensive Fowey Consols mine lies to the east near Tywardreath .   The port of Par Harbour , which lies within the parish , was developed to ease the transport of these minerals , and initially connected to the mines by the Par Canal . Whilst the port of Par is within the parish , the village of Par is actually just across the River Par , and hence lies in the civil parish of Tywardreath .   The Par Canal was soon replaced by the Cornwall Minerals Railway , which had a depot and station in the town , and still exists as part of the Atlantic Coast Line . Whilst St Blazey depot is still in use , St Blazey station closed to passengers in 1925 , and the town is now served by Par station on the Cornish Main Line in Par village .   Tourism   The Eden Project is located within the civil parish , and about a mile and half ( 2 km ) from the centre of the town .

television licence or broadcast receiving licence is an official record of payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts , or the possession of a television set where some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fee paid . The licence is sometimes also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts . A TV licence is therefore effectively a hypothecated tax for the purpose of funding public broadcasting , thus allowing public broadcasters to transmit television programmes without , or with only supplemental , funding from radio and television advertisements . However , in some cases the balance between public funding and advertisements is the opposite - the Polish TVP broadcaster receives more funds from advertisements than from its TV tax .   Whilst TV licensing is rare in the Americas , half of the countries in Asia , a few countries in Africa , and two-thirds of the countries in Europe use television licences to fund public television .   History   The early days of broadcasting presented broadcasters with the problem of how to raise funding for their services . Some countries adopted the advertising model , but many others adopted a compulsory public subscription model , with the subscription coming in the form of a broadcast licence paid by households owning a radio set ( and later , a TV set ) .   The UK was the first country to adopt the compulsory public subscription model with the licence fee money going to the BBC , which was formed on 1 January 1927 by Royal Charter to produce publicly funded programming yet remain independent from government , both managerially and financially . The licence was originally known as a wireless licence .   With the arrival of television some countries created a separate additional television licence , while others simply increased the radio licence fee to cover the additional cost of TV broadcasting , changing the licence 's name from `` radio licence '' to `` TV licence '' or `` receiver licence '' . Today most countries fund public radio broadcasting from the same licence fee that is used for television , although a few still have separate radio licences , or apply a lower or no fee at all for consumers who only have a radio . Some countries also have different fees for users with colour or monochrome TV . Many give discounts , or charge no fee , for elderly and/or disabled consumers .   Faced with the problem of licence fee evasion , some countries choose to fund public broadcasters directly from taxation or via other less avoidable methods such as a co-payment with electricity billing . National public broadcasters in some countries also carry supplemental advertising .   The Council of Europe created the European Convention on Transfrontier Television in 1989 that regulates among other things  advertising standards , time and the format of breaks , which also has an indirect effect on the usage of licensing . In 1993 , this treaty entered into force when it achieved 7 ratifications including 5 member states . It has since been acceded to by 34 countries , .   Television licences around the world   The Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago notes that two-thirds of the countries in Europe and half of the countries in Asia and Africa use television licences to fund public television . TV licensing is rare in the Americas , largely being confined to French overseas departments and British Overseas Territories .   In some countries , radio channels and broadcasters ' web sites are also funded by a radio receiver licence , giving access to radio and web services free of commercial advertising .   The actual cost and implementation of the television licence varies greatly from country to country . The rest of this section looks at the licence fee in a number of countries around the world .   Europe   Albania   The Albanian licence fee is 800 lek\u00eb ( \u20ac5.81 ) per year . However , the licence fee makes up only a small part of public broadcaster RTSh 's funding . RTSh is mainly funded directly from the government through taxes ( 58 % ) , the remaining 42 % comes from commercials and the licence fee .

History   Early history   The surrounding area fell to Alexander the Great in 330 B.C . It later fell to Chandragupta Maurya . The Mauryas introduced Hinduism and Buddhism to the region , and were attempting to expand their empire to Central Asia until they faced local Greco-Bactrian forces .

Buddhist doctrines are reported to have reached as far as Balkh even during the life of the Buddha ( 563 BCE to 483 BCE ) , as recorded by Xuanzang .   The region was historically known as Kafiristan ( meaning `` Land of the kafirs '' ) because of its inhabitants : the Nuristani , an ethnically distinctive people who practiced a form of ancient Hinduism . It was conquered by Emir Abdur Rahman Khan in the late 19th century and the Nuristani people began converting to Islam .   British missionaries wrote :   The region was renamed Nuristan , meaning Land of the enlightened , a reflection of the `` enlightening '' of the pagan Nuristani by the `` light-giving '' of Islam .   Nuristan was once thought to have been a region through which Alexander the Great passed with a detachment of his army ; thus the folk legend that the Nuristani people are descendants of Alexander ( or `` his generals '' ) .   Abdul Wakil Khan Nuristani is one of the most prominent figures in Nuristan 's history . He fought against the British-led Punjabi army and drove them out of the eastern provinces of Afghanistan . He is buried on the same plateau where King Amanullah Khan is buried .   Recent history   Since the creation of Pakistan in 1947 , Afghan politicians ( particularly Mohammed Daoud Khan ) have been focusing on re-annexing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of what is now Pakistan . This has led to militancy on both sides of the Durand Line . In the meantime , Pakistani politicians have been focusing on connecting what is now Tajikistan with Pakistan . This requires weakening Afghan rule in Nuristan and Badakhshan provinces by secretly funding anti-Afghan rebel forces .   Nuristan was the scene of some of the heaviest guerrilla fightings during the 1980s Soviet war in Afghanistan . The province was influenced by Mawlawi Afzal 's Islamic Revolutionary State of Afghanistan , which was supported by Pakistan nationalists and Saudi Arabia .

The park is located on the Colorado River 4 mi north of Moab , Utah . It is known for containing over 2,000 natural sandstone arches , including the world-famous Delicate Arch , in addition to a variety of unique geological resources and formations .   The park is located just outside Moab , Utah , and is in area . Its highest elevation is 5653 ft at Elephant Butte , and its lowest elevation is 4085 ft at the visitor center . Forty-three arches are known to have collapsed since 1977 . The park receives 10 in of rain a year on average .   Administered by the National Park Service , the area was originally named a National Monument on April 12 , 1929 . It was redesignated as a National Park on November 12 , 1971 .   Geology   The national park lies atop an underground evaporite layer or salt bed , which is the main cause of the formation of the arches , spires , balanced rocks , sandstone fins , and eroded monoliths in the area . This salt bed is thousands of feet thick in places , and was deposited in the Paradox Basin of the Colorado Plateau some 300 million years ago when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated . Over millions of years , the salt bed was covered with debris eroded from the Uncompahgre Uplift to the northeast . During the Early Jurassic ( about 210 Ma ) desert conditions prevailed in the region and the vast Navajo Sandstone was deposited . An additional sequence of stream laid and windblown sediments , the Entrada Sandstone ( about 140 Ma ) , was deposited on top of the Navajo . Over 5000 feet ( 1500 m ) of younger sediments were deposited and have been mostly eroded away . Remnants of the cover exist in the area including exposures of the Cretaceous Mancos Shale . The arches of the area are developed mostly within the Entrada formation.Kiver , Eugene P. and David V. Harris , Geology of U. S. Parklands , Wiley , 5th ed. , 1999 p.503-515 ISBN 0-471-33218-6   The weight of this cover caused the salt bed below it to liquefy and thrust up layers of rock into salt domes . The evaporites of the area formed more unusual salt anticlines or linear regions of uplift . Faulting occurred and whole sections of rock subsided into the areas between the domes . In some places , they turned almost on edge . The result of one such 2500 ft displacement , the Moab Fault , is seen from the visitor center .   As this subsurface movement of salt shaped the landscape , erosion removed the younger rock layers from the surface . Except for isolated remnants , the major formations visible in the park today are the salmon-colored Entrada Sandstone , in which most of the arches form , and the buff-colored Navajo Sandstone . These are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park . Over time , water seeped into the surface cracks , joints , and folds of these layers . Ice formed in the fissures , expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock , breaking off bits and pieces . Winds later cleaned out the loose particles . A series of free-standing fins remained . Wind and water attacked these fins until , in some , the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out . Many damaged fins collapsed . Others , with the right degree of hardness and balance , survived despite their missing sections . These became the famous arches .   Although the park 's terrain appears rugged and durable , it is the exact opposite . More than 700,000 visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem . The problem lies within the soil 's crust which is composed of cyanobacteria , algae , fungi , and lichens that grow in the dusty parts of the park .

Martin ( born August 14 , 1945 ) is an American actor , comedian , writer , producer and musician . Martin came to public notice in the 1960s as a writer for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour , and later as a frequent guest on The Tonight Show . In the 1970s , Martin performed his offbeat , absurdist comedy routines before packed houses on national tours . Since the 1980s , having branched away from stand-up comedy , Martin has become a successful actor , as well as an author , playwright , pianist and banjo player , eventually earning him an Emmy , Grammy and American Comedy awards , among other honors .   In 2004 , Comedy Central ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics . He was awarded an Honorary Academy Award at the Academy 's 5th Annual Governors Awards in 2013 .   While he has played banjo since an early age , and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career , he has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s , acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo , recording , and touring with various bluegrass acts , including Earl Scruggs , with whom he won a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002 . He released his first solo music album , The Crow : New Songs for the 5-String Banjo , in 2009 , for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album .   Early life   Martin was born on August 14 , 1945 , in Waco , Texas , the son of Mary Lee ( n\u00e9e Stewart ; 1913\u20132002 ) and Glenn Vernon Martin ( 1914\u20131997 ) , a real estate salesman and aspiring actor . Martin was raised in Inglewood , California , and then later in Garden Grove , California , in a Baptist family . Martin was a cheerleader of Garden Grove High School . One of his earliest memories is of seeing his father , as an extra , serving drinks onstage at the Call Board Theatre on Melrose Place . During World War II , in England , Martin 's father had appeared in a production of Our Town with Raymond Massey . Expressing his affection through gifts of cars , bikes , etc. , Martin 's father was stern , and not emotionally open to his son . He was proud but critical , with Martin later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly ones of hatred . Martin 's first job was at Disneyland , selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during the school 's summer break . That lasted for three years ( 1955\u201358 ) . During his free time he frequented the Main Street Magic shop , where tricks were demonstrated to potential customers . By 1960 , he had mastered several of the tricks and illusions , and took a paying job at the Magic shop in Fantasyland in August . There he perfected his talents for magic , juggling , and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor Wally Boag , Martin ( 2007 ) p18\u201319 frequently performing for tips . In his authorized biography , close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could `` be described most accurately as an agnostic [ ... ] he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition '' .   Comedy   After high school graduation , Martin attended Santa Ana College , taking classes in drama and English poetry . In his free time , he teamed up with friend and Garden Grove High School classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre . He joined a comedy troupe at Knott 's Berry Farm . Later , he met budding actress Stormie Sherk , and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved . Sherk 's influence caused Martin to apply to the California State University , Long Beach , for enrollment with a major in Philosophy . Stormie enrolled at UCLA , about an hour 's drive north , and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives .   Inspired by his philosophy classes , Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor-comedian . His time at college changed his life . `` It changed what I believe and what I think about everything . I majored in philosophy . Something about non-sequiturs appealed to me .

The album spent twenty two weeks on the UK Albums Chart , peaking at number two . Across the Atlantic , it reached number 28 in Canada on the RPM 100 album chart and number 70 on the Billboard 200 chart , and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1990 . It has sold consistently well ever since and has received unanimous critical acclaim , with NME listing it as the greatest album of all time in 2013 .   Songwriting   Guitarist Johnny Marr wrote several songs that would later appear on The Queen Is Dead while the Smiths toured Britain in early 1985 , working out song arrangements with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce during soundchecks . The title of the album is from the novel , `` Last Exit to Brooklyn '' by author Hubert Selby , Jr .. The title of the album could be a reference to the scene in Macbeth where Seyton informs the title character of his wife 's murder ( `` The queen , my Lord , is dead '' ) . The title could also refer to a scene in Cymbeline where Cornelius , the doctor , informs Cymbeline , the king , `` The queen is dead .

A demo of the music for `` Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others '' was posted by Marr through Morrissey 's letterbox in the summer of 1985 . Morrissey then completed the song by adding lyrics .

The first of these is reputed to have been addressed to Geoff Travis , head of the Smiths ' record label Rough Trade . Travis has since described it as `` a funny lyric '' about `` Morrissey 's desire to be somewhere else '' , acknowledging that a line in the song about `` bloody awful poetry '' was a reference to a poem he had written for Morrissey .   `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out '' features lyrics drawn from `` Lonely Planet Boy '' by the New York Dolls . According to Marr : `` When we first played it , I thought it was the best song I 'd ever heard '' . The guitar part of `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out ' draws on the Rolling Stones cover of Marvin Gaye 's `` Hitch Hike '' , a song that , itself , was an inspiration for the Velvet Underground 's `` There She Goes Again '' .   The music for `` Never Had No One Ever '' , completed in August 1985 , was based on a demo which Marr had recorded in December 1984 , itself based on `` I Need Somebody '' by the Stooges . According to Marr : `` The atmosphere of that track pretty much sums up the whole album and what it was like recording it .

A state is specifically a political and geopolitical entity , whilst a nation is a cultural and ethnic one . The term `` nation state '' implies that the two coincide , in that a state has chosen to adopt and endorse a specific cultural group as associated with it . `` Nation state '' formation can take place at different times in different parts of the world .   The concept of a nation state can be compared and contrasted with that of the multinational state , city state , empire , confederation , and other state formations with which it may overlap . The key distinction is the identification of a people with a polity in the `` nation state . ''   History and origins   The origins and early history of nation states are disputed . A major theoretical question is : `` Which came first , the nation or the nation state ? '' Scholars such as Steven Weber , David Woodward , and Jeremy Black have advanced the hypothesis that the nation state did n't arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source , nor was it an accident of history or political invention ; but is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in political economy , capitalism , mercantilism , political geography , and geography combined together with cartography and advances in map-making technologies . It was with these intellectual discoveries and technological advances that the nation state arose . For others , the nation existed first , then nationalist movements arose for sovereignty , and the nation state was created to meet that demand . Some `` modernization theories '' of nationalism see it as a product of government policies to unify and modernize an already existing state . Most theories see the nation state as a 19th-century European phenomenon , facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education , mass literacy and mass media . However , historians also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in Portugal and the Dutch Republic .   In France , Eric Hobsbawm argues , the French state preceded the formation of the French people . Hobsbawm considers that the state made the French nation , not French nationalism , which emerged at the end of the 19th century , the time of the Dreyfus Affair . At the time of the 1789 French Revolution , only half of the French people spoke some French , and 12-13 % spoke it `` fairly '' , according to Hobsbawm .   During the Italian unification , the number of people speaking the Italian language was even lower . The French state promoted the unification of various dialects and languages into the French language . The introduction of conscription and the Third Republic 's 1880s laws on public instruction , facilitated the creation of a national identity , under this theory .   Some nation states , such as Germany or Italy , came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by nationalists , during the 19th century . In both cases , the territory was previously divided among other states , some of them very small . The sense of common identity was at first a cultural movement , such as in the V\u00f6lkisch movement in German-speaking states , which rapidly acquired a political significance . In these cases , the nationalist sentiment and the nationalist movement clearly precede the unification of the German and Italian nation states .   Historians Hans Kohn , Liah Greenfeld , Philip White and others have classified nations such as Germany or Italy , where cultural unification preceded state unification , as ethnic nations", "modContext": "Such a definition is a working one : `` All attempts to develop terminological consensus around `` nation '' resulted in failure '' , concludes .

Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth sport and is a common fixture in most international games\u2014it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee , is disqualified for breaking a rule , resigns by throwing in a towel , or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges ' scorecards at the end of the contest . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , the fight is considered a draw ( professional boxing ) . In Olympic boxing , due to the fact that a winner must be declared , in the case of a draw - the judges use technical criteria to choose the most deserving winner of the bout .   While people have fought in hand-to-hand combat since before the dawn of history , the origin of boxing as an organized sport may be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game in BC 688 . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century , again initially in Great Britain and later in the United States .   History   Ancient history   See also Ancient Greek boxing   The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a Sumerian relief in Iraq from the 3rd millennium BCE Later depictions from the 2nd millennium BC are found in reliefs from the Mesopotamian nations of Assyria and Babylonia , and in Hittite art from Asia Minor . The earliest evidence for fist fighting with any kind of gloves can be found on Minoan Crete ( c.1650\u20131400 BCE ) , and on Sardinia , if we consider the boxing statues of Prama mountains ( c. 2000\u20131000 BC ) .   Boxing was a popular spectator sport in Ancient Rome . In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped leather thongs around their fists . Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a weapon . The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestus which then led to a more sinister weapon called the myrmex ( 'limb piercer ' ) . Fighting events were held at Roman Amphitheatres . The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events . However , especially in later times , purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities , and their lives were not given up without due consideration . Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor . This is where the term ring came from . In AD 393 , during the Roman gladiator period , boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality . It was not until the late 17th century that boxing re-surfaced in London .   Early London prize ring rules   Records of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western Roman Empire when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned . However , there are detailed records of various fist-fighting sports that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries . There was also a sport in ancient Rus called Kulachniy Boy or `` Fist Fighting '' .   As the wearing of swords became less common , there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists . The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of bare-knuckle boxing sometimes referred to as prizefighting . The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the London Protestant Mercury , and the first English bare-knuckle champion was James Figg in 1719 . This is also the time when the word `` boxing '' first came to be used . It should be noted , that this earliest form of modern boxing was very different . Contests in Mr. Figg 's time , in addition to fist fighting , also contained fencing and cudgeling .

Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor but fail to prevent a security guard opening a door , leading to a fire flash which burns Giddings ( and who is later disclosed to have died ) .   Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan , who refuses to order an evacuation . Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze , which soon spreads out of control .

They make a perilous climb down the stairs but fire forces them up to the Promenade Room . With fire suppression efforts becoming ineffective , the building loses electrical power and O'Halloran 's men are forced to rappel down an elevator shaft .   A rooftop rescue results in disaster as guests rush the helicopter , causing it to crash , setting the roof ablaze and rendering further rooftop rescues impossible . Naval rescue teams attach a breeches buoy to the adjacent Peerless Building and rescue a number of guests , including Duncan 's daughter , Simmons ' wife Patty . Roberts rigs a gravity brake on the external scenic elevator allowing twelve people , including Roberts ' girlfriend Susan , Mueller , and the children , one trip down .

Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan , who refuses to order an evacuation . SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor , directing them to express elevators . Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget .   Duncan , aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey , directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe . Not heeding Duncan 's directions , one last group takes an elevator to the ground , but are killed when it stops on the fire 's floor .   Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and the family from 87 . Jernigan gets the mother out safely but Roberts , Mueller and the two children are halted by a collapsed stairwell . With fire suppression efforts becoming ineffective , the building loses electrical power and O'Halloran 's men are forced to rappel down an elevator shaft . Naval rescue teams attach a breeches buoy to the adjacent Peerless Building and rescue a number of guests , including Duncan 's daughter , Simmons ' wife Patty . Roberts rigs a gravity brake on the external scenic elevator allowing twelve people , including Roberts ' girlfriend Susan , Mueller , and the children , one trip down . O'Halloran and others save the rest .   Simmons tells Duncan that he and others will use the breeches buoy next , but Duncan punches him , saying the rest will draw numbers but he and his son-in-law will be the last to leave .", "question": "in which us city is the 1974 film towering inferno set?", "groundTruth": "san fran", "answer": "san francisco", "modAnswer": "san francisco", "delete sentence number": ["The Towering Inferno is a 1974 American action drama disaster film produced by Irwin Allen featuring an all-star cast led by Paul Newman and Steve McQueen .", "   A co-production between 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros.", " ( this was the first film to be a joint venture by two major Hollywood studios ) , it was adapted by Stirling Silliphant from a pair of novels , The Tower by Richard Martin Stern and The Glass Inferno by Thomas N.", "   The film was a critical success , earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture , and was the highest-grossing film released in 1974 .", " The film was nominated for eight Oscars in all , winning three .", " Simpson , Robert Vaughn , Robert Wagner , Susan Flannery , Gregory Sierra , Dabney Coleman and , in her final film , Jennifer Jones .", "   Plot   Architect Doug Roberts returns to San Francisco for the dedication of the Glass Tower , which he designed for owner James Duncan .", " At 138 stories ( 1,800 ft/550 m ) , it is the world 's tallest building .", " Shortly after his arrival , an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor .", "   During the dedication ceremony , public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower 's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries .", " Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned .", " Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze , which soon spreads out of control .", " A guest , Lisolette Mueller , who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne , rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family .", " The fire also traps Bigelow and his secretary/mistress Lorrie in his 65th floor office , killing them .", " They make a perilous climb down the stairs but fire forces them up to the Promenade Room .", "   A rooftop rescue results in disaster as guests rush the helicopter , causing it to crash , setting the roof ablaze and rendering further rooftop rescues impossible .", " An explosion leaves the descending elevator hanging by a single cable at the 110th floor , where Mueller falls to her death ."], "distance value": [[0, 0.5920672416687012], [29, 0.3333006501197815], [3, 0.3270567059516907], [6, 0.3143051266670227], [17, 0.2951974868774414], [13, 0.2851954996585846], [15, 0.2589785158634186], [26, 0.23161354660987854], [11, 0.2264150232076645], [12, 0.21254438161849976], [34, 0.2122742235660553], [20, 0.1924639642238617], [25, 0.18208268284797668], [2, 0.1725621521472931], [24, 0.1642669439315796], [10, 0.15953418612480164], [22, 0.1463480293750763], [21, 0.13256314396858215], [19, 0.11810436844825745], [27, 0.10633797943592072], [31, 0.10341880470514297], [18, 0.10191638767719269], [5, 0.09551818668842316], [1, 0.09108880162239075], [28, 0.08627791702747345], [8, 0.08545670658349991], [4, 0.08203586935997009], [33, 0.08035259693861008], [16, 0.07000593096017838], [14, 0.06598349660634995], [30, 0.06523606926202774], [7, 0.03475258871912956], [35, 0.021792903542518616], [9, 0.004007274284958839], [32, 0.0029908008873462677], [36, -0.0674993246793747], [23, -0.06951183825731277]]}, {"test case number": 144, "context": "In music , dynamics are instructions in musical notation to the performer about hearing the loudness of a note or phrase . More generally , dynamics may also include other aspects of the execution of a given piece .   Relative loudness   The two basic dynamic indications in music are :  * p or piano , meaning `` soft '' .  * f or forte , meaning `` loud '' .   More subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by :  * mp , standing for mezzo-piano , meaning `` moderately soft '' .  * mf , standing for mezzo-forte , meaning `` moderately loud '' .   Beyond f and p , there are also  * pp , standing for `` pianissimo '' and meaning `` very soft '' .  * ff , standing for `` fortissimo '' and meaning `` very loud '' .  * ppp , standing for `` pianississimo '' and meaning `` very very soft '' .  * fff , standing for `` fortississimo '' and meaning `` very very loud '' .  And so on .   Some pieces contain dynamic designations with more than three f 's or p 's . In Holst 's The Planets , ffff occurs twice in Mars and once in Uranus often punctuated by organ and fff occurs several times throughout the work . It also appears in Heitor Villa-Lobos ' Bachianas Brasileiras No . 4 ( Prelude ) , and in Liszt 's Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale `` Ad nos , ad salutarem undam '' . The Norman Dello Joio Suite for Piano ends with a crescendo to a ffff , and Tchaikovsky indicated a bassoon solo pppppp ( 6 p 's ) in his Path\u00e9tique Symphony and ffff in passages of his 1812 Overture and the 2nd movement of his Fifth Symphony .   Igor Stravinsky used ffff at the end of the finale of the Firebird Suite . ffff is also found in a prelude by Rachmaninoff , op.3-2 . Shostakovich even went as loud as fffff ( 5 f 's ) in his fourth symphony . Gustav Mahler , in the third movement of his Seventh Symphony , gives the celli and basses a marking of fffff ( 5 f 's ) , along with a footnote directing 'pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood . ' On another extreme , Carl Nielsen , in the second movement of his Symphony No . 5 , marked a passage for woodwinds a diminuendo to ppppp ( 5 p 's ) .   Another more extreme dynamic is in Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti 's \u00c9tudes No . 13 ( Devil 's Staircase ) , which has at one point a ffffff ( 6 f 's ) and progresses to a ffffffff ( 8 f 's ) . In Ligeti 's \u00c9tudes No . 9 , he uses pppppppp ( 8 p 's ) . In the baritone passage Era la notte from his opera Otello , Verdi uses pppp . Steane ( 1971 ) and others suggest that such markings are in reality a strong reminder to less than subtle singers to at least sing softly rather than an instruction to the singer actually to attempt a pppp .   Dynamic indications of this kind are relative , not absolute . mp does not indicate an exact level of volume , it merely indicates that music in a passage so marked should be a little louder than p and a little quieter than mf . Interpretations of dynamic levels are left mostly to the performer ; in the Barber Piano Nocturne , a phrase beginning pp is followed by a diminuendo leading to a mp marking . Another instance of performer 's discretion in this piece occurs when the left hand is shown to crescendo to a f , and then immediately after marked p while the right hand plays the melody f. It has been speculated that this is used simply to remind the performer to keep the melody louder than the harmonic line in the left hand .  In some music notation programs , there are default MIDI key velocity values associated with these indications , but more sophisticated programs allow users to change these as needed .

Finland 's population is 5.5 million ( 2014 ) , staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades . The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region . In terms of area , it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union .   Finland is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in the capital Helsinki , local governments in 317 municipalities , and an autonomous region , the \u00c5land Islands . Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area , which produces a third of the country 's GDP . From the late 12th century , Finland was an integral part of Sweden , a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and its official status . In the spirit of the notion of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson ( 1791\u20131858 ) , `` we are no-longer Swedes , we do not want to become Russians , let us therefore be Finns '' , the Finnish national identity started to establish .

Founded in 1541 , Santiago has been the capital city of Chile since colonial times . The city has a downtown core of 19th century neoclassical architecture and winding side-streets , dotted by art deco , neo-gothic , and other styles . Santiago 's cityscape is shaped by several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing Mapocho River , lined by parks such as Parque Forestal . The Andes Mountains can be seen from most points in the city . These mountains contribute to a considerable smog problem , particularly during winter . The city outskirts are surrounded by vineyards and Santiago is within a few hours of both the mountains and the Pacific Ocean .   Santiago is the cultural , political and financial center of Chile and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations . The Chilean executive and judicial powers are located in Santiago , but Congress meets mostly in nearby Valpara\u00edso . Santiago is named after the biblical figure St. James .   Nomenclature   In Chile , there are several entities which bear the name of `` Santiago '' that are often confused . The Commune of Santiago , sometimes referred to as `` downtown '' or `` Central Santiago '' ( Santiago Centro ) , is an administrative division that comprises roughly the area occupied by the city during its colonial period . The commune , administered by the Municipality of Santiago and headed by a mayor , is part of the Santiago Province headed by a provincial governor , which is in itself a subdivision of the Santiago Metropolitan Region headed by an intendant . Despite these classifications , when the term `` Santiago '' is used without another descriptor , it usually refers to what is also known as Greater Santiago ( Gran Santiago ) , a territorial extension defined by its urban continuity that includes the Commune of Santiago in addition to 36 other communes , which together comprise the majority of the Santiago Province and some areas of neighboring provinces ( see Political divisions ) .   The city and region 's demonym is santiaguinos ( male ) and santiaguinas ( female ) .   History   Founding of the city   According to certain archaeological investigations , it is believed that the first human groups of the X millennium settled in the Santiago basin . The groups were mainly nomadic hunter-gatherers , who traveled from the coast to the interior in search of guanacos during the time of the Andean snowmelt . About the year 800 , the first sedentary inhabitants began to settle due to the formation of agricultural communities along the Mapocho River , mainly maize , potatoes and beans , and the domestication of camelids in the area .   The villages established in the areas belonging to picunches groups ( name given by Chileans ) or promaucaes ( name given by Incas ) , were subject to the Inca Empire throughout the late fifteenth century and into the early sixteenth century . The Incas settled in the valley of mitimaes , the main installation settled in the center of the present city , with strengths as Huaca de Chena and the sanctuary of El Plomo hill . The area would have served as a basis for the failed Inca expeditions southward road junction as the Inca Trail .   Having been sent by Francisco Pizarro from Peru and having made the long journey from Cuzco , Extremadura conquistador Pedro de Valdivia reached the valley of the Mapocho on 13 December 1540 . The hosts of Valdivia camped by the river in the slopes of the Tupahue hill and slowly began to interact with the picunches natives who inhabited the area . Valdivia later summoned the chiefs of the area to a parliament , where he explained his intention to found a city on behalf of the king Carlos I of Spain , which would be the capital of his governorship of Nueva Extremadura . The natives accepted and even recommended the foundation of the town on a small island between two branches of the river next to a small hill called Huel\u00e9n .

The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy has become an international multi-media phenomenon . The novels are the most widely distributed , having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005 .   The broad narrative follows the misadventures of the last surviving human , Arthur Dent , following the demolition of the planet Earth by a Vogon constructor fleet to make way for a hyperspace bypass .

Dent 's adventures intersect with several other characters : Ford Prefect ( who named himself after the Ford Prefect car to blend in with what was assumed to be the dominant life form , automobiles ) , an alien from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and a researcher for the eponymous guidebook who rescues Dent from Earth 's destruction ; Zaphod Beeblebrox , Ford 's eccentric semi-cousin and the Galactic President ; the depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android ; and Trillian , formerly known as Tricia McMillan , a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington and the only other human survivor of Earth 's destruction thanks to Beeblebrox ' intervention .   Background   The first radio series comes from a proposal called `` The Ends of the Earth '' : six self-contained episodes , all ending with Earth 's being destroyed in a different way . While writing the first episode , Adams realized that he needed someone on the planet who was an alien to provide some context , and that this alien needed a reason to be there . Adams finally settled on making the alien a roving researcher for a `` wholly remarkable book '' named The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy . As the first radio episode 's writing progressed , the Guide became the centre of his story , and he decided to focus the series on it , with the destruction of Earth being the only hold-over .   Adams claimed that the title came from a 1971 incident while he was hitchhiking around Europe as a young man with a copy of the Hitch-hiker 's Guide to Europe book : while lying drunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking up at the stars , he thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy as well .

With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Graeco-Roman art , still-life painting emerged as a distinct genre and professional specialization in Western painting by the late 16th century , and has remained significant since then . Still life gives the artist more freedom in the arrangement of elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as landscape or portraiture . Early still-life paintings , particularly before 1700 , often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted .

Still life emerged from the painting of details in larger compositions with subjects , and historically has been often combined with figure subjects , especially in Flemish Baroque painting . The term includes the painting of dead animals , especially game . Live ones are considered animal art , although in practice they were often painted from dead models . The still-life category also shares commonalities with zoological and especially botanical illustration , where there has been considerable overlap among artists . Generally a still life includes a fully depicted background , and puts aesthetic rather than illustrative concerns as primary . Still life occupied the lowest rung of the hierarchy of genres , but still has been extremely popular with buyers . As well as the independent still-life subject , still-life painting encompasses other types of painting with prominent still-life elements , usually symbolic , and `` images that rely on a multitude of still-life elements ostensibly to reproduce a 'slice of life ' . The trompe-l'\u0153il painting , which intends to deceive the viewer into thinking the scene is real , is a specialized type of still life , usually showing inanimate and relatively flat objects .   Antecedents and development   Still-life paintings often adorn the interior of ancient Egyptian tombs . It was believed that food objects and other items depicted there would , in the afterlife , become real and available for use by the deceased . Ancient Greek vase paintings also demonstrate great skill in depicting everyday objects and animals . Peiraikos is mentioned by Pliny the Elder as a panel painter of `` low '' subjects , such as survive in mosaic versions and provincial wall-paintings at Pompeii : `` barbers ' shops , cobblers ' stalls , asses , eatables and similar subjects '' . Similar still life , more simply decorative in intent , but with realistic perspective , have also been found in the Roman wall paintings and floor mosaics unearthed at Pompeii , Herculaneum and the Villa Boscoreale , including the later familiar motif of a glass bowl of fruit . Decorative mosaics termed `` emblema '' , found in the homes of rich Romans , demonstrated the range of food enjoyed by the upper classes , and also functioned as signs of hospitality and as celebrations of the seasons and of life . By the 16th century , food and flowers would again appear as symbols of the seasons and of the five senses . Also starting in Roman times is the tradition of the use of the skull in paintings as a symbol of mortality and earthly remains , often with the accompanying phrase Omnia mors aequat ( Death makes all equal ) . These vanitas images have been re-interpreted through the last 400 years of art history , starting with Dutch painters around 1600 .

Metals are generally malleable \u2014 that is , they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking \u2014 as well as fusible ( able to be fused or melted ) and ductile ( able to be drawn out into a thin wire ) . About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals , the others are nonmetals or metalloids . Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms .   Astrophysicists use the term `` metal '' to collectively describe all elements other than hydrogen and helium . In that sense , the metallicity of an object is the proportion of its matter made up of chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium .   Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures ; these are formed as metallic allotropes of non-metals .   Structure and bonding   The atoms of metallic substances are typically arranged in one of three common crystal structures , namely body-centered cubic ( bcc ) , face-centered cubic ( fcc ) , and hexagonal close-packed ( hcp ) . In bcc , each atom is positioned at the center of a cube of eight others . In fcc and hcp , each atom is surrounded by twelve others , but the stacking of the layers differs . Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature .   Atoms of metals readily lose their outer shell electrons , resulting in a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement . This provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity . While this flow of electrons occurs , the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud . This type of bond is called a metallic bond .   Properties   Chemical   Metals are usually inclined to form cations through electron loss , reacting with oxygen in the air to form oxides over various timescales ( iron rusts over years , while potassium burns in seconds ) . Examples :   4 Na + O2 \u2192 2 Na2O ( sodium oxide )  2 Ca + O2 \u2192 2 CaO ( calcium oxide )  4 Al + 3 O2 \u2192 2 Al2O3 ( aluminium oxide ) .   The transition metals ( such as iron , copper , zinc , and nickel ) are slower to oxidize because they form a passivating layer of oxide that protects the interior . Others , like palladium , platinum and gold , do not react with the atmosphere at all . Some metals form a barrier layer of oxide on their surface which can not be penetrated by further oxygen molecules and thus retain their shiny appearance and good conductivity for many decades ( like aluminium , magnesium , some steels , and titanium ) . The oxides of metals are generally basic , as opposed to those of nonmetals , which are acidic . Exceptions are largely oxides with very high oxidation states such as CrO3 , Mn2O7 , and OsO4 , which have strictly acidic reactions .   Painting , anodizing or plating metals are good ways to prevent their corrosion . However , a more reactive metal in the electrochemical series must be chosen for coating , especially when chipping of the coating is expected . Water and the two metals form an electrochemical cell , and if the coating is less reactive than the coatee , the coating actually promotes corrosion .   Physical   Metals in general have high electrical conductivity , high thermal conductivity , and high density . Typically they are malleable and ductile , deforming under stress without cleaving . In terms of optical properties , metals are shiny and lustrous . Sheets of metal beyond a few micrometres in thickness appear opaque , but gold leaf transmits green light .   Although most metals have higher densities than most nonmetals , there is wide variation in their densities , lithium being the least dense solid element and osmium the densest . The alkali and alkaline earth metals in groups I A and II A are referred to as the light metals because they have low density , low hardness , and low melting points . The high density of most metals is due to the tightly", "modContext": " In bcc , each atom is positioned at the center of a cube of eight others .

Invented in about 1700 ( the exact date is uncertain ) , the piano is widely employed in classical , jazz , traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances , accompaniment , and for composing and rehearsal . Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones . With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed . The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced .   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments . The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe . During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings . By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key . Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case , soundboard , bridge , and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings .   Invention   The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori ( 1655\u20131731 ) of Padua , Italy , who was employed by Ferdinando de ' Medici , Grand Prince of Tuscany , as the Keeper of the Instruments ; he was an expert harpsichord maker , and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments .

It is dedicated to the image and arms of Saint George , England 's patron saint .   It is awarded at the Sovereign 's pleasure as a personal gift on recipients from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms . Membership of the Order is limited to the Sovereign , the Prince of Wales , and no more than 24 members , or Companions . The order also includes supernumerary knights and ladies ( e.g . members of the British Royal Family and foreign monarchs ) .   New appointments to the Order of the Garter are always announced on St George 's Day ( 23 April ) , as Saint George is the order 's patron saint .   The order 's emblem is a garter with the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense ( Middle French : `` shame on him who thinks evil of it '' ) in gold lettering . Members of the order wear it on ceremonial occasions .   History   King Edward III founded the Order of the Garter around the time of his claim to the French throne . The year is usually presumed to be 1348 , however , the Complete Peerage , under `` The Founders of the Order of the Garter '' , states the order was first instituted on 23 April 1344 , listing each founding member as knighted in 1344 . The list includes Sir Sanchet D'Abrichecourt , who died on 20 October 1345 . Other dates from 1344 to 1351 have also been proposed . The King 's wardrobe account shows Garter habits first issued in the autumn of 1348 . Also , its original statutes required that each member of the Order already be a knight ( what would now be referred to as a knight bachelor ) and some of the initial members listed were only knighted that year .

It is the most popular vin de primeur , fermented for just a few weeks before being released for sale on the third Thursday of November . This `` Beaujolais Nouveau Day '' used to see heavy marketing , with races to get the first bottles to different markets around the globe . The current release practice is to ship the wine ahead of the third Thursday of November , and release it to the local markets at 12:01 a.m. local time .   History   Beaujolais had always made a vin de l'ann\u00e9e to celebrate the end of the harvest , but until WWII it was only for local consumption . In fact , once the Beaujolais AOC was established in 1937 , AOC rules meant that Beaujolais wine could only be officially sold after 15 December in the year of harvest . Warning - plays music by default These rules were relaxed on 13 November 1951 , and the Union Interprofessionnelle des Vins du Beaujolais ( UIVB ) formally set 15 November as the release date for what would henceforth be known as Beaujolais nouveau .   A few members of the UIVB saw the potential for marketing Beaujolais nouveau . Not only was it a way to clear lots of vin ordinaire at a good profit , but selling wine within weeks of the harvest was great for cash flow . Hence the idea was born of a race to Paris carrying the first bottles of the new vintage . This attracted a lot of media coverage , and by the 1970s had become a national event . The races spread to neighbouring countries in Europe in the 1980s , followed by North America , and in the 1990s to Asia . In 1985 , the date was changed to the third Thursday in November to take best advantage of marketing in the following weekend .   Production   Beaujolais nouveau is made from the Gamay noir \u00e0 Jus blanc grape , better known simply as Gamay . The grapes must come from the Beaujolais AOC , with those of the ten `` cru '' appellations excluded . They are grown in `` stony , schistous soils '' . Both Beaujolais Nouveau and Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau are produced ; the latter comes from the ~ 30 non-cru villages in the region .   By law , all grapes in the region must be harvested by hand . The wine is made using carbonic maceration , whole berry anaerobic fermentation which emphasizes fruit flavors without extracting bitter tannins from the grape skins . Grapes are loaded into a large ( think 20,000 gallon ) sealed container that is filled with carbon dioxide . Grapes that are gently crushed at the bottom of the container by the weight of the grapes start to ferment , emitting more CO2 . All this carbon dioxide causes fermentation to take place inside the uncrushed grapes ( without access to oxygen , hence `` anaerobic fermentation '' ) . The resulting wine is fresh , fruity , and very low in tannins .   Celebration    This `` Beaujolais Day '' is accompanied by publicity events and heavy advertising . The traditional slogan , even in English-speaking countries , was `` Le Beaujolais nouveau est arriv\u00e9 ! '' ( literally , `` The new Beaujolais has arrived ! `` ) , but in 2005 this was changed to `` It 's Beaujolais Nouveau Time ! `` . In the United States , it is promoted as a drink for Thanksgiving , which always falls exactly one week after the wine is released ( on the fourth Thursday of November ) . Many producers release the nouveau with colourful or abstract design that changes every year , usually as an evolution from the previous year 's design . Duboeuf has silk ties made each year with their label 's abstract design , and releases them through select wholesalers and distributors .   Style   Beaujolais nouveau is a purple-pink wine reflecting its youth , bottled only 6-8 weeks after harvest . The method of production means that there is very little tannin , and the wine can be dominated by such fruity ester flavours as banana , grape , strawberry , fig and pear drop . The wine is recommended to be slightly chilled to 13\u00b0C ( 55\u00b0F ) .   Beaujolais nouveau is intended for immediate drinking . While some nouveau can be kept for a few years , there 's no real reason to , as it does n't improve with age .", "modContext": "m. local time .

Prior to this he was the 40th Vice President of the United States , serving from 1973 until President Richard Nixon 's resignation in 1974 . He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment , following the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew on October 10 , 1973 . Becoming president upon Richard Nixon 's departure on August 9 , 1974 , he claimed the distinction as the first and to date the only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to either office . As he was appointed to fill a vacancy and then succeeded to the presidency , Ford also earned the distinction of being the only person in American history to neither begin nor finish either a presidential or vice presidential term on the date of a regularly-scheduled inauguration . Before ascending to the vice presidency , Ford served 25 years as Representative from Michigan 's 5th congressional district , the final 9 of them as the House Minority Leader .   As President , Ford signed the Helsinki Accords , marking a move toward d\u00e9tente in the Cold War . With the conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency , U.S. involvement in Vietnam essentially ended . Domestically , Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression , with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure . One of his more controversial acts was to grant a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal . During Ford 's presidency , foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play , and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President . In the GOP presidential primary campaign of 1976 , Ford defeated then-former California Governor Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination . He narrowly lost the presidential election to the Democratic challenger , then-former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter , on November 2 .   Following his years as President , Ford remained active in the Republican Party . After experiencing health problems , he died in his home on December 26 , 2006 . Ford lived longer than any other U.S. president , 93 years and 165 days , while his 895-day presidency remains the shortest term of all presidents who did not die in office . As of 2016 , he is also the most recent former president and vice president to die .

His mother was Dorothy Ayer Gardner , and his father was Leslie Lynch King Sr. , a wool trader and a son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King ( n\u00e9e Porter ) .

From there , she moved to the home of her parents , Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer , in Grand Rapids , Michigan . Dorothy and King divorced in December 1913 ; she gained full custody of her son . Ford 's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930 .   Ford later said his biological father had a history of hitting his mother . James M. Cannon , a member of the Ford administration , wrote in a biography of Ford that the Kings ' separation and divorce were sparked when , a few days after Ford 's birth , Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife , his infant son , and Ford 's nursemaid .

History   The first mosque in the world is often considered to be the area around the Kaaba in Mecca now known as the Masjid al-Haram . Since as early as 638 AD , the Masjid al-Haram has been expanded on several occasions to accommodate the increasing number of Muslims who either live in the area or make the annual pilgrimage known as hajj to the city . Others regard the first mosque in history to be the Quba Mosque in present-day Medina since it was the first structure built by Muhammad upon his emigration from Mecca in 622 .   The Islamic Prophet Muhammad went on to establish another mosque in Medina , which is now known as the Masjid an-Nabawi , or the Prophet 's Mosque . Built on the site of his home , Muhammad participated in the construction of the mosque himself and helped pioneer the concept of the mosque as the focal point of the Islamic city . The Masjid al-Nabawi introduced some of the features still common in today 's mosques , including the niche at the front of the prayer space known as the mihrab and the tiered pulpit called the minbar . The Masjid al-Nabawi was also constructed with a large courtyard , a motif common among mosques built since then .   Diffusion and evolution   Mosques had been built in Iraq and North Africa by the end of the 7th century , as Islam spread outside the Arabian Peninsula with early caliphates . The Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala is reportedly one of the oldest mosques in Iraq , although its present form - typical of Persian architecture - only goes back to the 11th century . The shrine , while still operating as a mosque , remains one of the holiest sites for Shia Muslims , as it honors the death of the third Shia imam , and Prophet Muhammad 's grandson , Hussein ibn Ali .

It is bordered by Togo to the west , Nigeria to the east , and Burkina Faso and Niger to the north . A majority of the population live on its small southern coastline on the Bight of Benin , part of the Gulf of Guinea in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean . The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo , but the seat of government is in Cotonou , the country 's largest city and economic capital . Benin covers an area of 114,763 square kilometers and its population in 2015 was estimated to be approximately 10.88 million . Benin is a tropical , sub-Saharan nation , highly dependent on agriculture , with substantial employment and income arising from subsistence farming .   The official language of Benin is French . However , indigenous languages such as Fon and Yoruba are commonly spoken . The largest religious group in Benin is Roman Catholicism , followed closely by Islam , Vodun and Protestantism . Benin is a member of the United Nations , the African Union , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone , La Francophonie , the Community of Sahel-Saharan States , the African Petroleum Producers Association and the Niger Basin Authority .   From the 17th to the 19th century , the main political entities in the area were the Kingdom of Dahomey along with the city-state of Porto-Novo and a large area with many different tribes to the north . This region was referred to as the Slave Coast from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of slaves shipped to the New World during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade . After slavery was abolished , France took over the country and renamed it French Dahomey . In 1960 , Dahomey gained full independence from France , and had a tumultuous period with many different democratic governments , many military coups and military governments .   A Marxist\u2013Leninist state called the People 's Republic of Benin existed between 1975 and 1990 . In 1991 , it was replaced by the current multi-party Republic of Benin .   Etymology   During the colonial period and at independence , the country was known as Dahomey . On 30 November 1975 it was renamed to Benin , after the body of water on which the country lies\u2014the Bight of Benin\u2014which , in turn , had been named after the Benin Empire ( nowadays Nigeria ) . The country of Benin has no connection to Benin City in modern Nigeria , nor to the Benin bronzes .   The new name , Benin , was chosen for its neutrality . Dahomey was the name of the former Kingdom of Dahomey , which covered only most of the southern third of the present country and therefore did not represent Porto-Novo ( a rival state in the south ) , the northwestern sector Atakora , nor the kingdom of Borgu , which covered the northeastern third .   History   Precolonial history   The current country of Benin combines three areas which had different political and ethnic systems prior to French colonial control . Before 1700 , there were a few important city states along the coast ( primarily of the Aja ethnic group , but also including Yoruba and Gbe peoples ) and a mass of tribal regions inland ( composed of Bariba , Mahi , Gedevi , and Kabye peoples ) . The Oyo Empire , located primarily to the east of modern Benin , was the most significant large-scale military force in the region and it would regularly conduct raids and exact tribute from the coastal kingdoms and the tribal regions . The situation changed in the 1600s and early 1700s as the Kingdom of Dahomey , which was of Fon ethnicity , was founded on the Abomey plateau and began taking over areas along the coast . By 1727 , king Agaja of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of Allada and Whydah , but it had become a tributary of the Oyo empire and did not directly attack the Oyo allied city-state of Porto-Novo . The rise of the kingdom of Dahomey , the rivalry between the kingdom and the city of Porto-Novo , and the continued tribal politics of the northern region , persisted into the colonial and post-colonial periods .

It is the group 's biggest selling single to date and was the final single to feature founding member Kerry Katona , who left the group mid-way through promoting the single . `` Whole Again '' was the first single released from the album in Europe , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . It was a massive success , reaching number one in several countries , and sold 1 million copies in the UK alone . Among the song 's writers was OMD frontman and Atomic Kitten founder Andy McCluskey , who achieved his only UK number one single with the track .   Following the departure of Katona , she was replaced a few days later by Jenny Frost , just after the single reached number one in the UK . As a result , the music video was reshot and Frost 's vocals appeared on the reissue of Right Now .   Background   Following the failures of previous single `` Follow Me '' and the initial release of their debut album , Right Now , Atomic Kitten persuaded Virgin Records to release the single as a last-ditch attempt to keep their record deal . They were given a shoe-string budget for the single 's release with a basic video and previous photo shoots used for cover artwork . During promotion for the single , band member Kerry Katona announced her pregnancy and subsequent decision to leave the group .

The original version of Right Now features Katona 's vocals ; however , the reissue of the album features new vocals by Jenny Frost . This version has since replaced Katona 's version for radio airplay , and it was subsequently issued as a bonus track on international versions of the group 's second album , Feels So Good .   The first line of the song is identical to that of `` Walk on By '' by Bacharach and David .   Music video   The music video for `` Whole Again '' was filmed on a very small budget due to the commercial failure of previous single `` Follow Me '' . It features the girls singing in front of a plain white background \u2013 similar to the video for the Sugababes ' debut single `` Overload '' . The original version of the video includes Kerry Katona , who had left the group just before the song 's release . Much of the video was subsequently reshot to feature new member Jenny Frost .

The video ends with the camera zooming out on the field for Atomic Kitten 's old logo is invisible in a shape of a kitten .

He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the war god Mars , and is known in Latin also as Amor ( `` Love '' ) . His Greek counterpart is Eros.Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia , The Book People , Haydock , 1995 , p. 215 .   Although Eros is in Classical Greek art as a slender winged youth , during the Hellenistic period , he was increasingly portrayed as a chubby boy . During this time , his iconography acquired the bow and arrow that represent his source of power : a person , or even a deity , who is shot by Cupid 's arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire . In myths , Cupid is a minor character who serves mostly to set the plot in motion . He is a main character only in the tale of Cupid and Psyche , when wounded by his own weapons he experiences the ordeal of love . Although other extended stories are not told about him , his tradition is rich in poetic themes and visual scenarios , such as `` Love conquers all '' and the retaliatory punishment or torture of Cupid .   In art , Cupid often appears in multiples as the Amores , or amorini in the later terminology of art history , the equivalent of the Greek erotes . Cupids are a frequent motif of both Roman art and later Western art of the classical tradition . In the 15th century , the iconography of Cupid starts to become indistinguishable from the putto .   Cupid continued to be a popular figure in the Middle Ages , when under Christian influence he often had a dual nature as Heavenly and Earthly love . In the Renaissance , a renewed interest in classical philosophy endowed him with complex allegorical meanings . In contemporary popular culture , Cupid is shown drawing his bow to inspire romantic love , often as an icon of Valentine 's Day .   Origins and birth   The Romans reinterpreted myths and concepts pertaining to the Greek Eros for Cupid in their own literature and art , and medieval and Renaissance mythographers conflate the two freely . In the Greek tradition , Eros had a dual , contradictory genealogy . He was among the primordial gods who came into existence asexually ; after his generation , deities were begotten through male-female unions . In Hesiod 's Theogony , only Chaos and Gaia ( Earth ) are older . Before the existence of gender dichotomy , Eros functioned by causing entities to separate from themselves that which they already contained .   At the same time , the Eros who was pictured as a boy or slim youth was regarded as the child of a divine couple , the identity of whom varied by source . The influential Renaissance mythographer Natale Conti began his chapter on Cupid/Eros by declaring that the Greeks themselves were unsure about his parentage : Heaven and Earth , Ares and Aphrodite , Night and Ether , or Strife and Zephyr . The Greek travel writer Pausanias , he notes , contradicts himself by saying at one point that Eros welcomed Aphrodite into the world , and at another that Eros was the son of Aphrodite and the youngest of the gods .   In Latin literature , Cupid is usually treated as the son of Venus without reference to a father . Seneca says that Vulcan , as the husband of Venus , is the father of Cupid . Cicero , however , says that there were three Cupids , as well as three Venuses : the first Cupid was the son of Mercury and Diana , the second of Mercury and the second Venus , and the third of Mars and the third Venus . This last Cupid was the equivalent of Anteros , `` Counter-Love , '' one of the Erotes , the gods who embody aspects of love . The multiple Cupids frolicking in art are the decorative manifestation of these proliferating loves and desires . During the English Renaissance , Christopher Marlowe wrote of `` ten thousand Cupids '' ; in Ben Jonson 's wedding masque Hymenaei , `` a thousand several-coloured loves ... hop about the nuptial room '' .   In the later classical tradition , Cupid is most often regarded as the son of Venus and Mars , whose love affair represented an allegory of Love and War .

The deluxe illustrated edition , published by Hetzel in November 1871 , included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and \u00c9douard Riou . The book was highly acclaimed when released and still is now ; it is regarded as one of the premiere adventure novels and one of Verne 's greatest works , along with Around the World in Eighty Days and Journey to the Center of the Earth . The description of Nemo 's ship , called the Nautilus , was considered ahead of its time , as it accurately describes features on submarines , which at the time were very primitive vessels . Thus , the book has been able to age well because of its scientific theories , unlike some of Verne 's other works , like Journey to the Center of the Earth , which are not scientifically accurate and serve more simply as adventure novels .   Title   The title refers to the distance traveled while under the sea and not to a depth , as 20,000 leagues is over six times the diameter , and nearly three times the circumference of the Earth . The greatest depth mentioned in the book is four leagues . ( The book uses metric leagues , which are four kilometres each . ) A literal translation of the French title would end in the plural `` seas '' , thus implying the `` seven seas '' through which the characters of the novel travel ; however , the early English translations of the title used `` sea '' , meaning the ocean in general .   Plot   During the year 1866 , ships of several nations spot a mysterious sea monster , which some suggest to be a giant narwhal . The United States government assembles an expedition in New York City to find and destroy the monster . Professor Pierre Aronnax , a French marine biologist and narrator of the story , who happens to be in New York at the time , receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition which he accepts . Canadian whaler and master harpoonist Ned Land and Aronnax 's faithful servant Conseil are also brought aboard .   The expedition departs Brooklyn aboard the United States Navy frigate Abraham Lincoln and travels south around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean . The ship finds the monster after a long search and then attacks the beast , which damages the ship 's rudder . The three protagonists are then hurled into the water and grasp hold of the `` hide '' of the creature , which they find , to their surprise , to be a submarine very far ahead of its era . They are quickly captured and brought inside the vessel , where they meet its enigmatic creator and commander , Captain Nemo .   The rest of the story follows the adventures of the protagonists aboard the creature\u2014the submarine , the Nautilus\u2014which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas free from any land-based government . Captain Nemo 's motivation is implied to be both a scientific thirst for knowledge and a desire for revenge on ( and self-imposed exile from ) civilization . Nemo explains that his submarine is electrically powered and can perform advanced marine biology research ; he also tells his new passengers that although he appreciates conversing with such an expert as Aronnax , maintaining the secrecy of his existence requires never letting them leave . Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the undersea adventures , but Ned Land can only think of escape .   They visit many places under the oceans , some real-life places , others completely fictional . Thus , the travelers witness the real corals of the Red Sea , the wrecks of the battle of Vigo Bay , the Antarctic ice shelves , the Transatlantic telegraph cable and the fictional submerged land of Atlantis . The travelers also use diving suits to hunt sharks and other marine life with air-guns and have an underwater funeral for a crew member who died when an accident occurred under mysterious\u2014and unknown to the reader\u2014conditions inside the Nautilus .

Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape , interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input device for computers .   A keyboard typically has characters engraved or printed on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol . However , to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence . While most keyboard keys produce letters , numbers or signs ( characters ) , other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or execute computer commands .   Despite the development of alternative input devices , such as the mouse , touchscreen , pen devices , character recognition and voice recognition , the keyboard remains the most commonly used device for direct ( human ) input of alphanumeric data into computers .   In normal usage , the keyboard is used as a text entry interface to type text and numbers into a word processor , text editor or other programs . In a modern computer , the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software . A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all key presses to the controlling software . Keyboards are also used for computer gaming , either with regular keyboards or by using keyboards with special gaming features , which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations . A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer , such as Windows ' Control-Alt-Delete combination , which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine .  A command-line interface is a type of user interface operated entirely through a keyboard , or another device doing the job of one .   History   While typewriters are the definitive ancestor of all key-based text entry devices , the computer keyboard as a device for electromechanical data entry and communication derives largely from the utility of two devices : teleprinters ( or teletypes ) and keypunches . It was through such devices that modern computer keyboards inherited their layouts .   As early as the 1870s , teleprinter-like devices were used to simultaneously type and transmit stock market text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to stock ticker machines to be immediately copied and displayed onto ticker tape . The teleprinter , in its more contemporary form , was developed from 1907 to 1910 by American mechanical engineer Charles Krum and his son Howard , with early contributions by electrical engineer Frank Pearne . Earlier models were developed separately by individuals such as Royal Earl House and Frederick G. Creed .   Earlier , Herman Hollerith developed the first keypunch devices , which soon evolved to include keys for text and number entry akin to normal typewriters by the 1930s .

players slide stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles . It is related to bowls , boules and shuffleboard . Two teams , each with four players , take turns sliding heavy , polished granite stones , also called rocks , across the ice curling sheet towards the house , a circular target marked on the ice . Each team has eight stones . The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game ; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end , which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones . A game usually consists of eight or ten ends .   The curler can induce a curved path by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides , and the path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms who accompany it as it slides down the sheet , using the brooms to alter the state of the ice in front of the stone . A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation , and the skills of the curlers determine how close to the desired result the stone will achieve . This gives curling its nickname of `` chess on ice '' .   Origins and history   Curling was invented in medieval Scotland , with the first written reference to a contest using stones on ice coming from the records of Paisley Abbey , Renfrewshire , in February 1541 . Two paintings , `` Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap '' and `` The Hunters in the Snow '' ( both dated 1565 ) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder depict Flemish peasants curling\u2014Scotland and the Low Countries had strong trading and cultural links during this period , which is also evident in the history of golf .   Evidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 uncovered ( along with another bearing the date 1551 ) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane , Scotland . Kilsyth Curling Club claims to be the first club in the world , having been formally constituted in 1716 ; it is still in existence today . Kilsyth also claims the oldest purpose-built curling pond in the world at Colzium , in the form of a low dam creating a shallow pool some 100 \u00d7 250 metres in size .   The word curling first appears in print in 1620 in Perth , Scotland , in the preface and the verses of a poem by Henry Adamson . The game was ( and still is , in Scotland and Scottish-settled regions like southern New Zealand ) also known as `` the roaring game '' because of the sound the stones make while traveling over the pebble ( droplets of water applied to the playing surface ) . The verbal noun curling is formed from the Scots ( and English ) verb curl , which describes the motion of the stone .   In the early history of curling , the playing stones were simply flat-bottomed river stones , which were of inconsistent size , shape and smoothness . Unlike today , the thrower had little control over the 'curl ' or velocity and relied more on luck than on precision , skill and strategy .   In Darvel , East Ayrshire , the weavers relaxed by playing curling matches using the heavy stone weights from the looms ' warp beams , fitted with a detachable handle for the purpose . Many a wife would keep her husband 's brass curling stone handle on the mantelpiece , brightly polished until the next time it was needed . Central Canadian curlers often used 'irons ' rather than stones until the early 1900s , Canada is the only country known to have done so , while others experimented with wood or ice-filled tins .   Outdoor curling was very popular in Scotland between the 16th and 19th centuries because the climate provided good ice conditions every winter . Scotland is home to the international governing body for curling , the World Curling Federation , Perth , which originated as a committee of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club , the mother club of curling .

While some venues are constructed specifically for operas , other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers .   History   The first public opera house came into existence in 1637 as the Teatro San Cassiano in Venice , Italy , in a country where opera has been popular through the centuries among ordinary people as well as wealthy patrons ; it still has a large number of working opera houses . In contrast , there was no opera house in London when Henry Purcell was composing and the first opera house in Germany was built in Hamburg in 1678 . Early United States opera houses served a variety of functions in towns and cities , hosting community dances , fairs , plays , and vaudeville shows as well as operas and other musical events .   In the 17th and 18th centuries , opera houses were often financed by rulers , nobles , and wealthy people who used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambitions and social positions or prestige . With the rise of bourgeois and capitalist social forms in the 19th century , European culture moved away from its patronage system to a publicly supported system . In the 2000s , most opera and theatre companies raise funds from a combination of government and institutional grants , ticket sales , and private donations .

animated spy comedy television series , created by Adam Reed for the FX network . The pilot episode of the series aired as a sneak peek on September 17 , 2009 , before the show made its official debut on January 14 , 2010 . On June 21 , 2016 , FX renewed the series for an eighth , ninth , and tenth season , each to consist of eight episodes . It was announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 that Season 8 will premiere in January 2017 , but the series is moving to FX \u2019 s sister network , FXX .   Premise   Originally working for the `` International Secret Intelligence Service '' ( ISIS ) in New York City , suave , profoundly self-centered master spy Sterling Archer deals with global espionage , as well as his domineering , emotionally-distant mother and boss Malory Archer , fellow ISIS agent and ex-girlfriend Lana Kane , and ISIS employees Ray Gillette , Cyril Figgis , Pam Poovey , Cheryl Tunt , and Dr. Algernop Krieger .   A season-long arc took place in the fifth season , re-configuring the show from a spy series to a Miami Vice-style satire of the drug industry . To reflect this , the season was titled Archer Vice . When ISIS is disbanded by the U.S. government , its employees take a stockpile of cocaine that they acquired from previous operations and form a drug cartel to fund their retirements . Meanwhile , Cheryl decides to launch a new career as a country singer .   In the sixth season , the series returned to the spy format , and essentially `` unrebooted '' the characters back to their personalities before the fifth season . However , some elements from the fifth season had a big impact on the series going forward , including new character introductions ( Lana Kane giving birth to her daughter , and Christian Slater playing a fictional version of himself ) , and the revelation of the CIA 's involvement in some of the events that happened during Archer Vice . The characters now started working as contractors for the CIA .   The seventh season once again retooled the show , after the characters were fired from the CIA and blacklisted from espionage in the sixth season finale following failure during a mission . They move to Los Angeles , California to start their own private detective agency , known as The Figgis Agency ( named after character Cyril Figgis ) . The show once again took on a serialized , season-long story arc .   Time period   The show 's time setting is comically anachronistic , deliberately mixing technologies , clothing styles and historical backdrops of different decades . The characters wear 1960s clothing and hairstyles , and many episodes feature references to the Soviet Union as a current nation , yet in the fourth-season episode `` Once Bitten '' , Turkmenistan is an independent nation rather than a Soviet republic . It also contains references to Fidel Castro as the current leader of Cuba . The show frequently uses pop-culture references which are contemporary to the 2010s , yet character backstories place them at older events \u2014 such as Woodhouse 's service in World War I , or Malory 's involvement in various espionage events of World War II and the Cold War era \u2014 which would require them to be much older than they are if the show were actually set in the 21st century .   The technological sophistication within the series also varies , with characters using dated computer technology ( e.g . reel-to-reel mainframe systems , desktop computers closely resembling the Macintosh XL , dot-matrix printers , and punch cards ) and making surveillance recordings on cassette tape rather than digitally , but also using modern technologies such as GPS devices , the Internet , laser gunsights , cryptocurrencies , USB flash drives and cellular phones ( season 6 saw the appearance of touchscreen devices and flip phones ) . This ambiguity is explicitly recognized in at least two episodes , in which characters are unable to answer when asked what year they think it is .

Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of parliamentary politics , the first-past-the-post electoral system used for general elections tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties , though each has in the past century relied upon a third party such as the Liberal Democrats to deliver a working majority in Parliament .

Jamaicans Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce are the reigning world and Olympic champions in the men 's and women 's 100 metres , respectively .   On an outdoor 400 metres running track , the 100 m is run on the home straight , with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race . Runners begin in the starting blocks and the race begins when an official fires the starter 's pistol . Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50\u201360 m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line .   The 10-second barrier has historically been a barometer of fast men 's performances , while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race . The current men 's world record is 9.58 seconds , set by Jamaica 's Usain Bolt in 2009 , while the women 's world record of 10.49 seconds set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 remains unbroken .

At high level meets , the time between the gun and first kick against the starting block is measured electronically , via sensors built in the gun and the blocks . A reaction time less than 0.1 s is considered a false start . The 0.2-second interval accounts for the sum of the time it takes for the sound of the starter 's pistol to reach the runners ' ears , and the time they take to react to it .   For many years a sprinter was disqualified if responsible for two false starts individually . However , this rule allowed some major races to be restarted so many times that the sprinters started to lose focus . The next iteration of the rule , introduced in February 2003 , meant that one false start was allowed among the field , but anyone responsible for a subsequent false start was disqualified .   This rule led to some sprinters deliberately false-starting to gain a psychological advantage : an individual with a slower reaction time might false-start , forcing the faster starters to wait and be sure of hearing the gun for the subsequent start , thereby losing some of their advantage . To avoid such abuse and to improve spectator enjoyment , the IAAF implemented a further change in the 2010 season \u2013 a false starting athlete now receives immediate disqualification .

Jahangir Khan is originally from Neway Kelay Payan , Peshawar . During his career he won the World Open six times and the British Open a record ten times . From 1981 to 1986 , he was unbeaten in competitive play . During that time he won 555 matches consecutively , the longest winning streak by any athlete in top-level professional sports as recorded by Guinness World Records . He retired as a player in 1993 , and has served as President of the World Squash Federation from 2002 to 2008 , when he became Emeritus President .   Playing career   Jahangir was coached initially by his father , Roshan , the 1957 British Open champion , then by his late brother Torsam . After his brother 's sudden death he was coached by his cousin Rehmat Khan , who guided Jahangir through most of his career . Jahangir was physically very weak as a child . Though the doctors had advised him not to take part in any sort of physical activity , after undergoing a couple of hernia operations his father let him play and try out their family game .   In 1979 , the Pakistan selectors decided not to select Jahangir to play in the world championships in Australia , judging him too weak from a recent illness . Jahangir decided instead to enter the World Amateur Individual Championship and , at the age of 15 , became the youngest-ever winner of that event .   In November 1979 , Jahangir 's older brother Torsam , who had been one of the leading international squash players in the 1970s , died suddenly of a heart attack during a tournament match in Australia . Torsam 's death profoundly affected Jahangir . He considered quitting the game , but decided to pursue a career in the sport as a tribute to his brother .

That tournament marked the start of an unbeaten run which lasted for five years and 555 matches . The hallmark of his play was his incredible fitness and stamina , which Rehmat Khan helped him build up through a punishing training and conditioning regime . Jahangir was quite simply the fittest player in the game , and would wear his opponents down through long rallies played at a furious pace .   In 1982 , Jahangir astonished everyone by winning the International Squash Players Association Championship without losing a single point .   The unbeaten run finally came to end in the final of the World Open in 1986 in Toulouse , France , when Jahangir lost to New Zealand 's Ross Norman . Norman had been in pursuit of Jahangir 's unbeaten streak , being beaten time and time again . `` One day Jahangir will be slightly off his game and I will get him '' , he vowed for five years .

Gable began his career as a stage actor and appeared as an extra in silent films between 1924 and 1926 , and progressed to supporting roles with a few films for MGM in 1931 . The next year , he landed his first leading Hollywood role and became a leading man in more than 60 motion pictures over the next three decades .   Gable won an Academy Award for Best Actor for It Happened One Night ( 1934 ) , and was nominated for leading roles in Mutiny on the Bounty ( 1935 ) and for his arguably best-known role as Rhett Butler in the epic Gone with the Wind ( 1939 ) .   Gable also found success commercially and critically with films such as Red Dust ( 1932 ) , Manhattan Melodrama ( 1934 ) , San Francisco ( 1936 ) , Saratoga ( 1937 ) Boom Town ( 1940 ) , The Hucksters ( 1947 ) Homecoming ( 1948 ) , and The Misfits ( 1961 ) , which was his final screen appearance .   Gable appeared opposite some of the most popular actresses of the time : Joan Crawford , who was his favorite actress with whom to work , was partnered with Gable in eight films , Myrna Loy worked with him seven times , and he was paired with Jean Harlow in six productions . He also starred with Lana Turner in four features , and with Norma Shearer and Ava Gardner in three each . Gable 's final film , The Misfits ( 1961 ) , united him with Marilyn Monroe ( also in her last screen appearance ) . Gable is considered one of the most consistent box-office performers in history , appearing on Quigley Publishing 's annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll 16 times . He was named the seventh-greatest male star of classic American cinema by the American Film Institute .   Life and career   Early life   William Clark Gable was born in Cadiz , Ohio , to William Henry `` Will '' Gable ( 1870\u20131948 ) , an oil-well driller , and his wife , Adeline ( n\u00e9e Hershelman ; 1869\u20131901 ) . Gable was named William after his father , but even in childhood , he was almost always called Clark . He was mistakenly listed as a female on his birth certificate . Among Gable 's ancestors were Pennsylvania Dutch ( German ) , Rhinelanders , and Bavarians . When he was six months old , his mother had him baptized as a Roman Catholic . She died when he was ten months old , possibly from a brain tumor . Will Gable refused to raise his son Catholic , provoking criticism from Adeline 's side of the family . The dispute was resolved when Will Gable agreed to allow his son to spend time with his maternal uncle , Charles Hershelman , and his wife on their farm in Vernon Township , Pennsylvania .   In April 1903 , Gable 's father married Jennie Dunlap ( 1874\u20131924 ) , whose family came from the small neighboring town of Hopedale . The marriage produced no children . Gable was a tall , shy child with a loud voice . His stepmother raised him to be well-dressed and well-groomed . Jennie played the piano and gave her stepson lessons at home . Later he took up brass instruments . At 13 , he was the only boy in the men 's town band . He was very mechanically inclined and loved to strip down and repair cars with his father . Though his father insisted on Gable doing `` manly '' things , like hunting and hard physical work , Gable loved language . Among trusted company , he would recite Shakespeare , particularly the sonnets . Will Gable agreed to buy a 72-volume set of The World 's Greatest Literature to improve his son 's education , but claimed he never saw his son use it . In 1917 , when Gable was in high school , his father had financial difficulties . Will decided to settle his debts and try his hand at farming , and the family moved to Ravenna , Ohio , near Akron . Despite his father 's insistence that he work the farm , Gable soon left to work in Akron 's B.F. Goodrich tire factory .

It can occur in four forms : skin , inhalation , intestinal , and injection . Symptoms begin between one day and two months after contracting the infection . The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless ulcer with a black center . The inhalation form presents with fever , chest pain , and shortness of breath . The intestinal form presents with nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or abdominal pain . The injection form presents with fever and an abscess at the site of drug injection .   Anthrax is spread by contact with the spores of the bacteria , which are often from infectious animal products . Contact is by breathing , eating , or through an area of broken skin . It does not typically spread directly between people . Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products , travelers , postal workers , and military personnel . Diagnosis can be confirmed based on finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by culture of a sample from the infected site .   The anthrax vaccine is recommended for people who are at high risk . Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred . Two months of antibiotics , such as doxycycline or ciprofloxacin , after exposure can also prevent infection . If infection occurs treatment is with antibiotics and possibly antitoxin . The type and number of antibiotics used depends on the type of infection . Antitoxin is recommended for those with widespread infection .   Anthrax among people is most common in Africa and central and southern Asia . It also occurs fairly regularly in southern Europe , but is uncommon in northern Europe and North America . Globally , at least 2,000 cases occur a year , with about two cases a year in the United States . Skin infections represent more than 95 % of cases . Without treatment the risk of death from skin anthrax is 24 % . For intestinal infection the risk of death is 25 % to 75 % while in inhaled anthrax despite treatment it is around 50 % to 80 % . Until the 20th century , anthrax infections killed hundreds of thousands of people and other animals each year . Anthrax has been developed as a weapon by a number of countries .

Signs and symptoms   Skin   Cutaneous anthrax , also known as Hide porter 's disease , is when anthrax occurs on the skin . It presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center ( eschar ) . The black eschar often shows up as a large , painless necrotic ulcer ( beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot , somewhat resembling bread mold ) at the site of infection . In general , cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure . Unlike bruises or most other lesions , cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain .   Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when B. anthracis spores enter through cuts on the skin . This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products .   Cutaneous anthrax is rarely fatal if treated , because the infection area is limited to the skin , preventing the lethal factor , edema factor , and protective antigen from entering and destroying a vital organ . Without treatment , about 20 % of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death .   Lungs   Respiratory infection in humans is relatively rare and initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days , followed by pneumonia and severe ( and often fatal ) respiratory collapse . Historical mortality rates were over 85 % , but , when treated early ( seen in the 2001 anthrax attacks ) , observed case fatality rate dropped to 45 % .

Much of the history of Hunter was played out in this area and it is generally what is referred as the Hunter Valley wine country . The majority of the Hunter Valley 's most prestigious vineyards are located on the southern valley and foothills of the Brokenback Range ( part of the Great Dividing Range ) . The topography of the Hunter includes mostly gently sloping hills with modest gradients . The one notable exception are the vineyards of Mount View just west of the town of Cessnock . The terrain of the Upper Hunter is noticeably flatter as the Goulburn River and other tributaries of the Hunter River dominate the area .   Despite being the area 's namesake , the Hunter River itself is not the dominant feature of the region\u2014falling behind the Brokenback Range for that distinction . The greater river system of the Hunter , which includes the Goulburn and important tributaries such as Giants Creek , do provide needed irrigation for areas such as the Upper Hunter than can be prone to drought condition . The origins of the river begin the Liverpool Range of the volcanic Barrington Tops and flows south and then east down to the Pacific Ocean at the seaport city of Newcastle .   The success of the Hunter Valley wine industry has been dominated by its proximity to Sydney with its settlement and plantings in the 19th century fuelled by the trade network that linked the valley to the city . The steady demand of consumers from Sydney continues to drive much of the Hunter Valley wine industry , including a factor in the economy by the tourism industry .   History   Over 30,000 years ago the Wonnarua tribe of aboriginal Australians inhabited the land that is now known as the Hunter Valley wine region . Along with the Worimi tribe to the north and the Awabakal to the south , the Wonnarua developed a trading route connecting the Coquun ( Hunter ) Valley to the harbour now known as Sydney harbour .   The wine-making history of Hunter Valley begins with the European settlement of the Sydney and the New South Wales region of Australia in the late 18th century as a penal colony of the British Empire . The Hunter River itself was discovered , by accident , in 1797 by British Lieutenant John Shortland as he searched for escaped convicts . The region soon became a valuable source for timber and coal that fuelled the steamship trade coming out of Sydney .   Grapevines were planted in Sydney soon after its discovery in 1788 and as settlements fanned northward up towards the Hunter , government authorities actively encouraged plantings as a means of promoting both public sobriety and safety . The logic behind the promotion of viticulture and winemaking was that men tend to become more drunk and disorderly when under the influence of highly alcoholic spirits . If enough wine was provided , it was believed , it could be a moderate influence that could tame the `` savagery '' .   It was under these auspices that the grapevine followed land prospector John Howe as he cut a path through the Australian wilderness from Sydney up to the overland area in what is now known as the ( Lower ) Hunter Valley proper in 1820 .

Associated Free State of Puerto Rico '' ) is the largest insular territory of the United States , and it is located in the northeastern Caribbean Sea . It is an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller islands such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . The territory does not observe daylight saving time , and its official languages are Spanish , which is predominant , and English . The island 's population is approximately 3.5 million . Puerto Rico 's rich history , tropical climate , diverse natural scenery , renowned traditional cuisine , and attractive tax incentives make it a popular destination for travelers from around the world .   Originally populated by the aboriginal Ta\u00edno people , the island was claimed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus for the Kingdom of Spain , enduring several invasion attempts by the French , Dutch , and British . During the four centuries of Spanish rule , the island 's ethnic , cultural and physical landscapes were transformed , as the island was settled overwhelmingly by Spanish settlers , primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , continuing right up until the end of the 19th century , as a result of which it is overwhelmingly Catholic and markedly Hispanic territory in terms of culture and language . In 1898 , following the Spanish\u2013American War , the United States annexed the island under the terms of the Treaty of Paris .   Puerto Ricans are natural-born citizens of the United States . Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the United States Congress , which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 . As a U.S. territory , American citizens residing on the island are `` disenfranchised at the national level '' and may not vote for president and vice president of the United States . However , Congress approved a local constitution , allowing U.S. citizens on the territory to elect a governor .   A 2012 referendum showed a majority ( 54 % of the electorate ) disagreed with `` the present form of territorial status , '' with full statehood as the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status . However , 470,000 voters left the second question blank , leading statehood opponents to suggest that the referendum actually revealed only 45 % support for statehood . Following the vote , the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution to request the president and Congress of the United States to end its current status as an unincorporated U.S. territory and begin the process of admission to the union as a state .   Etymology   Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen \u2013 a derivation of Borik\u00e9n , its indigenous Ta\u00edno name , which means `` Land of the Valiant Lord . '' The terms boricua and borincano derive from Borik\u00e9n and Borinquen respectively , and are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage . The island is also popularly known in Spanish as la isla del encanto , meaning `` the island of enchantment . ''   Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of Saint John the Baptist , while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico ( ) . Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico , while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city .   The island 's name was briefly changed to `` Porto Rico '' by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 . The anglicized name was used by the US government and private enterprises . The name was finally changed back to Puerto Rico by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by F\u00e9lix C\u00f3rdova D\u00e1vila in 1931 .   History   Pre-Columbian era   The ancient history of the archipelago known today as Puerto Rico is not well known . Unlike other larger , more advanced indigenous communities in the New World ( Aztec and Inca ) whose people left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies , the indigenous population of Puerto Rico left scant artifacts and evidence .

The film stars Emilio Estevez , Kiefer Sutherland , Lou Diamond Phillips , Charlie Sheen , Dermot Mulroney , Casey Siemaszko , Terence Stamp , Terry O'Quinn , Brian Keith , and Jack Palance .   Young Guns is a retelling of the adventures of Billy the Kid during the Lincoln County War , which took place in New Mexico during 1877\u201378 . It was filmed in and around New Mexico . Historian Dr. Paul Hutton called Young Guns the most historically accurate of all prior Billy the Kid films . It opened no . 1 at the box office , eventually earning $ 45 million from a moderate $ 11 million budget . A sequel , Young Guns II , was released in 1990 .   Plot   John Tunstall ( Terence Stamp ) , an educated Englishman and cattle rancher in Lincoln County , New Mexico , hires wayward young gunmen to live and work on his ranch . Tunstall is in heavy competition with a well-connected Irishman named Lawrence Murphy ( Jack Palance ) , who owns a large ranch ; their men clash on a regular basis . Tunstall recruits Billy ( Emilio Estevez ) and advises him to renounce violence saying that `` He who sows the wind will reap the whirlwind . '' Tensions escalate between the two camps , resulting in the murder of Tunstall . Billy , Doc Scurlock ( Kiefer Sutherland ) , Jose Chavez y Chavez ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) , Richard M. `` Dick '' Brewer ( Charlie Sheen ) , `` Dirty '' Steve Stephens ( Dermot Mulroney ) , and Charlie Bowdre ( Casey Siemaszko ) , consult their lawyer friend Alexander McSween ( Terry O'Quinn ) , who manages to get them deputized and given warrants for the arrest of Murphy 's murderous henchmen .   Billy quickly challenges Dick 's authority as leader , vowing revenge against Murphy and the men responsible for killing Tunstall . The men call themselves The Regulators and arrest some of the murderers , but hot-headed Billy is unable to wait for justice . He guns down unarmed men and goes on to kill one of his fellow Regulators ( later arrival J. McCloskey ) in the paranoid ( but correct ) belief that he was still in league with Murphy . The men are stripped of their badges , which they find out about by reading a newspaper . That same paper also confuses Dick for Billy , showing a picture of Dick labeled Billy the Kid , a nickname to which Billy takes an immediate liking .   While the local authorities begin their hunt for Billy and the boys , the Regulators argue about continuing with their warrants or to go on the run . One of the men on their list of warrants , Buckshot Roberts ( Brian Keith ) , tracks them down , barricades himself in an outhouse , and Dick dies in an intense shootout . Billy appoints himself as the new leader , the gang becomes famous and the U.S. Army is charged with bringing them to justice under Murphy 's corrupt political influence .   The gang eludes attention for some time , and Charlie gets married in Mexico . While attending the wedding , Billy meets Pat Garrett ( Patrick Wayne ) who is not yet a sheriff , but warns Billy of an attempt on Alex 's life by Murphy 's men that will happen the next day . Thus the gang packs up and heads off to save Alex .   Back in Lincoln , Murphy 's men , led by George W. Peppin , surround Alex 's house , trapping the Regulators , and a shootout begins . A ceasefire is called for the night . In the morning , accompanied by Murphy , the army comes in and torches the house , but Chavez escapes out the back . While the house is burning , the men come up with an escape plan . They begin throwing Alex 's possessions out the windows of the second floor .

7 February 1812 \u2013 9 June 1870 ) was an English writer and social critic . He created some of the world 's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era .. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity .   Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms .   Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features . His plots were carefully constructed , and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives . Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them , opening up and inspiring a new class of readers .   Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age . His 1843 novella , A Christmas Carol , remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre . Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted , and , like many of his novels , evoke images of early Victorian London . His 1859 novel , A Tale of Two Cities , set in London and Paris , is his best-known work of historical fiction . Dickens 's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers\u2014from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton\u2014for its realism , comedy , prose style , unique characterisations , and social criticism . On the other hand , Oscar Wilde , Henry James , and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth , loose writing , and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism . The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings , such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters .   Early years   Charles John Huffam Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 , at 1 Mile End Terrace ( now 393 Commercial Road ) , Landport in Portsea Island ( Portsmouth ) , the second of eight children of John Dickens ( 1785\u20131851 ) and Elizabeth Dickens ( n\u00e9e Barrow ; 1789\u20131863 ) . His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district . He asked Christopher Huffam , rigger to His Majesty 's Navy , gentleman , and head of an established firm , to act as godfather to Charles . Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey , the owner of a shipping company in Dickens 's eponymous Dombey and Son ( 1848 ) .   In January 1815 John Dickens was called back to London , and the family moved to Norfolk Street , Fitzrovia . When Charles was four , they relocated to Sheerness , and thence to Chatham , Kent , where he spent his formative years until the age of 11 . His early life seems to have been idyllic , though he thought himself a `` very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy '' .   Charles spent time outdoors but also read voraciously , including the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding , as well as Robinson Crusoe and Gil Blas .

Iron is the most abundant element ( by mass ) making up Earth , while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth .   Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe . However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15 % of the matter in the universe : the remainder is dark matter , the composition of which is unknown , but it is not composed of chemical elements .  The two lightest elements , hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe . The next three elements ( lithium , beryllium and boron ) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation , and are thus more rare than those that follow . Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis . The high abundance of oxygen , silicon , and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars . Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae , which , when they explode , blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants , where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed .   The term `` element '' is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons ( regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded , e.g . hydrogen in water ) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element ( e.g . hydrogen gas ) . For the second meaning , the terms `` elementary substance '' and `` simple substance '' have been suggested , but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature , whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used ( e.g . French corps simple , Russian \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e ) . One element can form multiple substances different by their structure ; they are called allotropes of the element .   When different elements are chemically combined , with the atoms held together by chemical bonds , they form chemical compounds . Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals . Among the more common of such `` native elements '' are copper , silver , gold , carbon ( as coal , graphite , or diamonds ) , and sulfur . All but a few of the most inert elements , such as noble gases and noble metals , are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form , as chemical compounds . While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms , most of these occur as mixtures . For example , atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen , oxygen , and argon , and native solid elements occur in alloys , such as that of iron and nickel .   The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon , sulfur , copper and gold . Later civilizations extracted elemental copper , tin , lead and iron from their ores by smelting , using charcoal . Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more , with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900 .   The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table , which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows ( `` periods '' ) in which the columns ( `` groups '' ) share recurring ( `` periodic '' ) physical and chemical properties .

"Giovanni Antonio Canal ( 28 October 1697 \u2013 19 April 1768 ) , better known as Canaletto , was an Italian painter of landscapes , or vedute , of Venice . He was also an important printmaker in etching . He was the son of the painter Bernardo Canal , he visited England between 1746\u201356 and he is famous for his urban landscapes of Venice . He is very famous for his scenes , usually associated with `` evocative views of the city '' . The Stonemason\u00b4s Yard , was his finest work around 1725 and was presented by Sir George Beaumont in 1823/8 .   Canaletto , together with Giambattista Pittoni , Giovan Battista Tiepolo , Giovan Battista Piazzetta , Giuseppe Maria Crespi and Francesco Guardi forms the ultimate group of Venetian old master painters .   Early career   He was born in Venice as the son of the painter Bernardo Canal , hence his mononym Canaletto ( `` little Canal '' ) , and Artemisia Barbieri . Canaletto served his apprenticeship with his father and his brother . He began in his father 's occupation , that of a theatrical scene painter . Canaletto was inspired by the Roman vedutista Giovanni Paolo Pannini , and started painting the daily life of the city and its people .   After returning from Rome in 1719 , he began painting in his topographical style . His first known signed and dated work is Architectural Capriccio ( 1723 , Milan , in a private collection ) . Studying with the older Luca Carlevarijs , a moderately-talented painter of urban cityscapes , he rapidly became his master 's equal .   In 1725 , the painter Alessandro Marchesini , who was also the buyer for the Lucchese art collector Stefano Conti , had inquired about buying two more 'views of Venice ' , when the agent urged him to consider instead the work of `` Antonio Canale ... it is like Carlevaris , but you can see the sun shining in it . ''   Outdoor painting   Much of Canaletto 's early artwork was painted `` from nature '' , differing from the then customary practice of completing paintings in the studio . Some of his later works do revert to this custom , as suggested by the tendency for distant figures to be painted as blobs of colour \u2013 an effect produced by using a camera obscura , which blurs farther-away objects .   However , his paintings are always notable for their accuracy : he recorded the seasonal submerging of Venice in water and ice .   Early and late work   Canaletto 's early works remain his most coveted and , according to many authorities , his best . One of his early pieces is The Stonemason 's Yard ( 1729 , London , the National Gallery ) which depicts a humble working area of the city .   Later Canaletto painted grand scenes of the canals of Venice and the Doge 's Palace . His large-scale landscapes portrayed the city 's pageantry and waning traditions , making innovative use of atmospheric effects and strong local colors . For these qualities , his works may be said to have anticipated Impressionism .   His graphic print S.A Giustina in Pr\u00e0 della Vale was found in the 2012 Nazi loot discovery .   Work in England   Many of his pictures were sold to Englishmen on their Grand Tour , often through the agency of the merchant Joseph Smith ( who was later appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744 ) .   It was Smith who acted as an agent for Canaletto , first in requesting paintings of Venice from the painter in the early 1720s and helping him to sell his paintings to other Englishmen .   In the 1740s Canaletto 's market was disrupted when the War of the Austrian Succession led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice . Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of `` capricci '' ( or architectural phantasies ) ( capriccio Italian for fancy ) in his vedute ideale , but the returns were not high enough , and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London , to be closer to his market .   He remained in England until 1755 , producing views of London ( including several of the new Westminster Bridge , which was completed during his stay ) and of his patrons ' castles and houses . His 1754 painting of Old Walton Bridge includes an image of Canaletto himself .   He was often expected to paint England", "modContext": " He was also an important printmaker in etching .

It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . Wales has over 1680 mi of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff ( the capital ) , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added ( GVA ) was \u00a345.5 billion ( \u00a315,145 per head , 74.0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain ) .   Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560,000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the `` land of song '' , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness .   Etymology   The English words `` Wales '' and `` Welsh '' derive from the same Germanic root ( singular Walh , plural Walha ) , which was itself derived from the name of the Celtic tribe known to the Romans as Volcae and which came to refer indiscriminately to all Celts and , later , to all inhabitants of the Roman Empire . The Old English-speaking Anglo-Saxons came to use the term W\u00e6lisc when referring to the Celtic Britons in particular , and W\u0113alas when referring to their lands . The modern names for some Continental European lands ( e.g . Wallonia and Wallachia ) and peoples ( e.g . the Vlachs via a borrowing into Old Church Slavonic ) have a similar etymology .   Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that the Anglo-Saxons associated with the Britons , including other non-Germanic territories in Britain ( e.g . Cornwall ) and Germanic territories particularly associated with Celtic Britons ( e.g . Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ) , as well as items associated with non-Germanic Europeans , such as the walnut .

According to the 1947 constitution , he is `` the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people . '' Historically , he is also the highest authority of the Shinto religion as he and his family are said to be the direct descendants of the sun-goddess Amaterasu , and his importance also lies in dealing with heavenly affairs , including Shinto ritual and rites throughout the nation .   In Japanese , the Emperor is called Tenn\u014d ( \u5929\u7687 ) , which means `` heavenly sovereign '' . In English , the use of the term Mikado ( \u5e1d ) for the Emperor was once common , but is now considered obsolete .   Currently , the Emperor of Japan is the only remaining monarch in the world reigning under the title of `` Emperor '' . The Imperial House of Japan is the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world . In the Kojiki or Nihon Shoki , a book of Japanese history finished in the eighth century , it is said that Japan was founded in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu . The current Emperor is Akihito . He acceded the Chrysanthemum Throne upon the death of his father , Emperor Sh\u014dwa ( Hirohito ) , in 1989 .   The role of the Emperor of Japan has historically alternated between a largely ceremonial symbolic role and that of an actual imperial ruler . Since the establishment of the first shogunate in 1192 , the Emperors of Japan have rarely taken on a role as supreme battlefield commander , unlike many Western monarchs . Japanese Emperors have nearly always been controlled by external political forces , to varying degrees . In fact , between 1192 and 1867 , the shoguns , or their shikken regents in Kamakura ( 1203\u20131333 ) , were the de facto rulers of Japan , although they were nominally appointed by the Emperor . After the Meiji restoration in 1867 , the Emperor was the embodiment of all sovereign power in the realm , as enshrined in the Meiji Constitution of 1889 . His current status as a figurehead dates from the 1947 Constitution .   Since the mid-nineteenth century , the Imperial Palace has been called Ky\u016bj\u014d ( \u5bae\u57ce ) , later K\u014dkyo ( \u7687\u5c45 ) , and is located on the former site of Edo Castle in the heart of Tokyo . Earlier , Emperors resided in Kyoto for nearly eleven centuries .   The Emperor 's Birthday ( December 23 ) is a national holiday .   Current role   Unlike most constitutional monarchies , the Emperor is not the nominal Chief Executive . Article 65 of the Constitution explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet , of which the Prime Minister is the leader . The Emperor is also not the ( ceremonial ) commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces . The Japan Self-Defense Forces Act of 1954 also explicitly vests this role with the Prime Minister .   The Emperor 's powers are limited only to important ceremonial functions . Article 4 of the Constitution stipulates that the Emperor `` shall perform only such acts in matters of state as are provided for in the Constitution and he shall not have powers related to government . '' It also stipulates that `` the advice and approval of the Cabinet shall be required for all acts of the Emperor in matters of state '' ( Article 3 ) . Article 4 also states that these duties can be delegated by the Emperor as provided for by law .   While the Emperor formally appoints the Prime Minister to office , Article 6 of the Constitution requires him to appoint the candidate `` as designated by the Diet '' , without specifically giving the Emperor the right to decline appointment .   Article 6 of the Constitution delegates the Emperor the following ceremonial roles :  # Appointment of the Prime Minister as designated by the Diet .  # Appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as designated by the Cabinet .

He typically appears with his mule Conchita , carrying sacks of harvested coffee beans . He has become an icon for Colombia as well as coffee in general , and Juan Valdez 's iconic appearance is frequently mimicked or parodied in television and other media .   The Juan Valdez character is used as an ingredient brand , to specifically denote coffee beans that are only grown and harvested in Colombia . Part of the advertising campaign includes convincing consumers that there are specific benefits of Colombian-grown and harvested coffee beans , `` including how soil components , altitude , varieties and harvesting methods create good flavor . '' The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia is entirely owned and controlled by Colombia 's coffee farmers , ( cafeteros ) which number over 500,000 people .

Different from other goddesses , nymphs are generally regarded as divine spirits who animate nature , and are usually depicted as beautiful , young nubile maidens who love to dance and sing ; their amorous freedom sets them apart from the restricted and chaste wives and daughters of the Greek polis . They are beloved by many and dwell in mountainous regions and forests by lakes and streams . Although they would never die of old age nor illness , and could give birth to fully immortal children if mated to a god , they themselves were not necessarily immortal , and could be beholden to death in various forms . Charybdis and Scylla were once nymphs .   Other nymphs , always in the shape of young maidens , were part of the retinue of a god , such as Dionysus , Hermes , or Pan , or a goddess , generally the huntress Artemis . Nymphs were the frequent target of satyrs .   Etymology   Nymphs are personifications of the creative and fostering activities of nature , most often identified with the life-giving outflow of springs : as Walter Burkert ( Burkert 1985 : III.3.3 ) remarks , `` The idea that rivers are gods and springs divine nymphs is deeply rooted not only in poetry but in belief and ritual ; the worship of these deities is limited only by the fact that they are inseparably identified with a specific locality . ''   The Greek word has `` bride '' and `` veiled '' among its meanings : hence a marriageable young woman . Other readers refer the word ( and also Latin nubere and German Knospe ) to a root expressing the idea of `` swelling '' ( according to Hesychius , one of the meanings of is `` rose-bud '' ) .   Adaptations   The Greek nymphs were spirits invariably bound to places , not unlike the Latin genius loci , and the difficulty of transferring their cult may be seen in the complicated myth that brought Arethusa to Sicily . In the works of the Greek-educated Latin poets , the nymphs gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous Italian divinities of springs and streams ( Juturna , Egeria , Carmentis , Fontus ) , while the Lymphae ( originally Lumpae ) , Italian water-goddesses , owing to the accidental similarity of their names , could be identified with the Greek Nymphae . The mythologies of classicizing Roman poets were unlikely to have affected the rites and cult of individual nymphs venerated by country people in the springs and clefts of Latium . Among the Roman literate class , their sphere of influence was restricted , and they appear almost exclusively as divinities of the watery element .   In modern Greek folklore   The ancient Greek belief in nymphs survived in many parts of the country into the early years of the twentieth century , when they were usually known as `` nereids '' . At that time , John Cuthbert Lawson wrote : `` ... there is probably no nook or hamlet in all Greece where the womenfolk at least do not scrupulously take precautions against the thefts and malice of the nereids , while many a man may still be found to recount in all good faith stories of their beauty , passion and caprice .   `` Nor is it a matter of faith only ; more than once I have been in villages where certain Nereids were known by sight to several persons ( so at least they averred ) ; and there was a wonderful agreement among the witnesses in the description of their appearance and dress . ''   Nymphs tended to frequent areas distant from humans but could be encountered by lone travelers outside the village , where their music might be heard , and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool , either during the noon heat or in the middle of the night . They might appear in a whirlwind . Such encounters could be dangerous , bringing dumbness , besotted infatuation , madness or stroke to the unfortunate human . When parents believed their child to be nereid-struck , they would pray to Saint Artemidos .   Modern sexual connotations   Due to the depiction of the mythological nymphs as females who mate with men or women at their own volition , and are completely outside of male control , the term is often", "modContext": " They are beloved by many and dwell in mountainous regions and forests by lakes and streams .

The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a Command Module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that landed back on Earth ; a Service Module ( SM ) , which supported the Command Module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a Lunar Module ( LM ) that had two stages \u2013 a lower stage for landing on the Moon , and an upper stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit .

It has a municipal population of 591,481 and a larger urban population of 1,280,371 ( ) . The Copenhagen metropolitan area has just over 2 million inhabitants . The city is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand ; another small portion of the city is located on Amager , and is separated from Malm\u00f6 , Sweden , by the strait of \u00d8resund .   Originally a Viking fishing village founded in the 10th century , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . After suffering from the effects of plague and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture . Later , following the Second World War , the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre .   Since the turn of the 21st century , Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development , facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure . The city is the cultural , economic and governmental centre of Denmark ; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange . Copenhagen 's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector , especially through initiatives in information technology , pharmaceuticals and clean technology . Since the completion of the \u00d8resund Bridge , Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city , Malm\u00f6 , forming the \u00d8resund Region . With a number of bridges connecting the various districts , the cityscape is characterized by parks , promenades and waterfronts . Copenhagen 's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens , the Little Mermaid Statue , the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces , Rosenborg Castle Gardens , Frederik 's Church , and many museums , restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions .   Copenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen , the Technical University of Denmark and Copenhagen Business School . The University of Copenhagen , founded in 1479 , is the oldest university in Denmark . Copenhagen is home to the FC K\u00f8benhavn and Br\u00f8ndby football clubs . The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980 . Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world . The Copenhagen Metro serves central Copenhagen together with the S-train network connecting the outlying boroughs . Serving roughly 2 million passengers a month , Copenhagen Airport , Kastrup , is the largest airport in the Nordic countries .   Etymology   The name of the city reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce . The original designation , from which the contemporary Danish name derives , was K\u00f8pmann\u00e6hafn , meaning `` merchants ' harbour '' , often simply Hafn or Havn ( `` harbour '' ) . The literal English translation would be `` Chapman 's haven '' . The English name for the city was adapted from its Low German name , Kopenhagen . The abbreviations Kbh . or Kbhvn are often used in Danish for K\u00f8benhavn , and kbh . for k\u00f8benhavnsk ( of Copenhagen ) .   The chemical element hafnium is named for Copenhagen ( Latin name Hafnia ) , where it was discovered . The bacterium Hafnia is also named after Copenhagen : Vagn M\u00f8ller of the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen named it in 1954 .

The show premiered on NBC on October 11 , 1975 , under the original title NBC 's Saturday Night . The show 's comedy sketches , which parody contemporary culture and politics , are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members . Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest ( who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast ) and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it 's Saturday Night ! `` , properly beginning the show .   In 1980 Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities . He was replaced by Jean Doumanian , who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews . Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera . Others associated with the show , such as writers , have gone on to successful careers creating , writing , or starring in TV and film .   Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC 's headquarters in the Comcast Building , SNL has aired 808 episodes since its debut , and concluded its forty-first season on May 21 , 2016 , making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States . The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries , including Canada , Spain , Italy , South Korea , Japan , Brazil , and Finland , each meeting with different levels of success . Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers ( 1980 ) and Wayne 's World ( 1992 ) . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of '' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show .   Throughout four decades on air , Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards , including 42 Primetime Emmy Awards , two Peabody Awards , and three Writers Guild of America Awards . In 2000 , it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame . It was ranked tenth in TV Guide `` 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time '' list , and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine 's `` 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME '' . As of 2012 , it has received 156 Emmy nominations , the most received by any TV show . The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship , with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests .   Development    From 1965 until September 1975 , NBC ran The Best of Carson reruns of The Tonight Show , airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates ' discretion ( originally known as The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson ) . In 1974 Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weeknights , allowing him to take time off .   In 1974 NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming , Dick Ebersol , and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot . At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller , Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels . Over the next three weeks , Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter 's idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches , political satire , and music performances . By 1975 Michaels had assembled a talented cast , including Dan Aykroyd , John Belushi , Chevy Chase , Jane Curtin , Garrett Morris , Laraine Newman , Michael O'Donoghue , Gilda Radner , and George Coe . The show was originally called NBC 's Saturday Night , because Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC .

History   BBC Four launched on 2 March 2002 at 19.00 GMT , having been delayed from the original planned 2001 launch . BBC 4 began originally as a late schedule to BBC 2 , before it received its own channel , along with BBC 3 . Weirdly , BBC 4 had to launch before BBC Three as a result of the government delaying approval plans . The channel replaced BBC Knowledge , an educational and cultural channel which had undergone many changes throughout its lifetime ; in its final format it carried a schedule of documentaries and art programming , essentially a test of the new BBC Four schedule . BBC Four would rebrand this channel , and bring it into line with the well recognised BBC One and Two brands at the same time . Planning for the new channel , along with the new BBC Three , had been in progress since October 2000 ; however , the incumbent government delayed approving the new BBC digital plans . The BBC Four plans were approved earlier , and as a result launched before BBC Three .   BBC Four was different from the old BBC Knowledge : the channel would be more heavily promoted with more new and original programming and the channel would not be broadcast 24 hours a day . This was because on the Freeview digital terrestrial platform , BBC Four is broadcast in a statistically multiplexed stream in Multiplex B that timeshares with the CBeebies channel ( which is on air from 6.00 until 19.00 ) . As a result , BBC Four broadcasts from 19.00 to around 4.00 each night , with an hour 's down-time and promotions for CBeebies before the start of that channel 's schedule .   On 12 May 2011 , BBC Four was added to the Sky EPG in Ireland on channel 230 .

The channel direction is determined by the channel 's remit , set by royal charter and the corporation 's governing body ( the BBC Trust ) , and by the channel controller . In October 2013 , following the departure of Richard Klein from the controllership , the management of the channel changed , with the role of Controller of BBC Four scrapped : from this point the Controller of BBC Two would have ultimate oversight of BBC Four as part of their role , absorbing some of the former duties of the Controller of BBC Four , but a new 'Channel Editor ' post , reporting up to this controller , would be created to take day-to-day charge of Four .

Dutch and English were the first official languages of South Africa from 1910 to 1925 . Afrikaans was added as a part of Dutch in 1925 , although in practice , Afrikaans effectively replaced Dutch , which fell into disuse . When South Africa became a republic in 1961 the official relationship changed such that Afrikaans was considered to include Dutch , and Dutch was dropped in 1984 , so between 1984 and 1994 , South Africa had two official languages : English and Afrikaans .   Different government departments and official bodies use different terms to denote Northern Sotho . In South Africa , Southern Ndebele is known simply as Ndebele , as most speakers of Northern Ndebele live in Zimbabwe .   Since taking power in the 1994 election , the ANC has promoted English as the main language of government , even if South Africans often take pride in using indigenous languages for any purpose . Afrikaans also features prominently in commerce together with English , as the languages with the highest number of fluent speakers are Afrikaans and English .   In terms of linguistic classification , the official languages include two West Germanic languages ( English and Afrikaans ) and nine Bantu languages . Four of these are Nguni languages ( Zulu , Xhosa , Swati and Ndebele ) and three are Sotho\u2013Tswana languages ( Northern Sotho , Southern Sotho and Tswana ) .

Language demographics   The most common language spoken as a first language by South Africans is Zulu ( 23 percent ) , followed by Xhosa ( 16 percent ) , and Afrikaans ( 14 percent ) . English is the fourth most common first language in the country ( 9.6 % ) , but is understood in most urban areas and is the dominant language in government and the media .   The majority of South Africans speak a language from one of the two principal branches of the Bantu languages represented in South Africa : the Sotho\u2013Tswana branch ( Sesotho , Northern Sotho , Tswana ) , or the Nguni branch ( Zulu , Xhosa , Swazi , Ndebele ) .

Gauteng is the most linguistically heterogeneous province , with roughly equal numbers of Nguni , Sesotho and Indo-European language speakers . This has resulted in the spread of an urban argot , Tsotsitaal , in large urban townships in the province .   Afrikaans , a language derived from Dutch , is the most widely spoken language in the western half of the country ( Western and Northern Cape ) . It is spoken as first language by approximately 61 percent of whites and 76 percent of Coloured ( multiracial ) people in the country . Afrikaans is also spoken widely across the centre and north of the country , as a second ( or third or even fourth ) language by Black South Africans living in farming areas .

The only surviving examples of monotremes are all indigenous to Australia and New Guinea , although there is evidence that they were once more widespread . The existing monotreme species are the platypus and four species of echidnas . There is currently some debate regarding monotreme taxonomy .   The word monotreme comes from the Greek \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 , monos ( `` single '' ) and \u03c4\u03c1\u1fc6\u03bc\u03b1 , trema ( `` hole '' ) , referring to the cloaca .   General characteristics   Like other mammals , monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate ( though not as high as other mammals ; see below ) ; have hair on their bodies ; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young ; have a single bone in their lower jaw ; and have three middle-ear bones .   In common with reptiles and marsupials , monotremes lack the connective structure ( corpus callosum ) which in placental mammals is the primary communication route between the right and left brain hemispheres . The anterior commissure does provide an alternate communication route between the two hemispheres , though , and in monotremes and marsupials it carries all the commissural fibers arising from the neocortex , whereas in placental mammals the anterior commissure carries only some of these fibers .   Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults . Fossil forms and modern platypus young have a `` tribosphenic '' form of molars ( with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle ) , which is one of the hallmarks of extant mammals .

Underground , or by its nickname the Tube ) is a public rapid transit system serving Greater London and some adjacent parts of the counties of Buckinghamshire , Essex and Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom .   The world 's first underground railway , the Metropolitan Railway , which opened in 1863 , is now part of the Circle , Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines ; the first line to operate underground electric traction trains , the City & South London Railway in 1890 , is now part of the Northern line . The network has expanded to 11 lines , and in 2015\u201316 carried 1.34 billion passengers , making it the world 's 11th busiest metro system .   The system 's first tunnels were built just below the surface , using the cut-and-cover method ; later , smaller , roughly circular tunnels \u2013 which gave rise to its nickname , the Tube \u2013 were dug through at a deeper level . The system has 270 stations and 250 mi of track . Despite its name , only 45 % of the system is actually underground in tunnels , with much of the network in the outer environs of London being on the surface . In addition , the Underground does not cover most southern parts of Greater London , with less than 10 % of the stations located south of the River Thames .   The early tube lines , originally owned by several private companies , were brought together under the `` '' brand in the early 20th century and eventually merged along with the sub-surface lines and bus services in 1933 to form London Transport under the control of the London Passenger Transport Board ( LPTB ) . The current operator , London Underground Limited ( LUL ) , is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London ( TfL ) , the statutory corporation responsible for the transport network in Greater London . , 92 % of operational expenditure is covered by passenger fares . The Travelcard ticket was introduced in 1983 and Oyster , a contactless ticketing system , in 2003 . Contactless card payments were introduced in 2014 .   The LPTB was a prominent patron of art and design , commissioning many new station buildings , posters and public artworks in a modernist style . The schematic Tube map , designed by Harry Beck in 1931 , was voted a national design icon in 2006 and now includes other TfL transport systems such as the Docklands Light Railway , London Overground and TfL Rail . Other famous London Underground branding includes the roundel and Johnston typeface , created by Edward Johnston in 1916 .   History   Early years   The idea of an underground railway linking the City of London with some of the railway termini in its urban centre was proposed in the 1830s , and the Metropolitan Railway was granted permission to build such a line in 1854 . To prepare construction , a short test tunnel was built in 1855 in Kibblesworth , a small town with geological properties similar to London . This test tunnel was used for two years in the development of the first underground train , and was later , in 1861 , filled up . The world 's first underground railway , it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives . It was hailed as a success , carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day , and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service . The Metropolitan District Railway ( commonly known as the District Railway ) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for an underground `` inner circle '' connecting London 's main-line termini . The Metropolitan and District railways completed the Circle line in 1884 , built using the cut and cover method . Both railways expanded , the District building five branches to the west reaching Ealing , Hounslow , Uxbridge , Richmond and Wimbledon and the Metropolitan eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire , more than 50 mi from Baker Street and the centre of London .   For the first deep-level tube line , the City and South London Railway , two 10 ft diameter circular tunnels were dug between King William Street ( close to today 's Monument station ) and Stockwell , under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface . This opened in 1890 with electric locomotives that hauled carriages with small opaque windows , nicknamed padded cells .", "modContext": "34 billion passengers , making it the world 's 11th busiest metro system . later , smaller , roughly circular tunnels \u2013 which gave rise to its nickname , the Tube \u2013 were dug through at a deeper level .

The order of the astrological signs is Aries , Taurus , Gemini , Cancer , Leo , Virgo , Libra , Scorpio , Sagittarius , Capricorn , Aquarius and Pisces .   The concept of the zodiac originated in Babylonian astrology , and was later influenced by Hellenistic culture .

Various approaches to measuring and dividing the sky are currently used by differing systems of astrology , although the tradition of the Zodiac 's names and symbols remain consistent . Western astrology measures from Equinox and Solstice points ( points relating to equal , longest and shortest days of the tropical year ) , while Jyoti\u1e63a or Vedic astrology measures along the equatorial plane ( sidereal year ) .

Isolated references to celestial `` signs '' in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac . Specifically , the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction .   By the 4th century BC , Babylonians ' astronomy and their system of celestial omens were influencing the Greek culture and , by the late 2nd century BC , Egyptian astrology was also mixing in . This resulted , unlike the Mesopotamian tradition , in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of horoscopic astrology , employing the use of the Ascendant ( the rising degree of the ecliptic , at the time of birth ) , and of the twelve houses . Association of the astrological signs with Empedocles ' four classical elements was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs .   The body of astrological knowledge by the 2nd century AD is described in Ptolemy 's Tetrabiblos , a work that was responsible for astrology 's successful spread across Europe and the Middle East , and remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings .

The Big Breakfast was produced by Planet 24 , the production company co-owned by former Boomtown Rats singer and Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof .   The programme was distinctive for broadcasting live from a former lockkeepers ' cottages commonly referred to as `` The Big Breakfast House '' , or more simply , `` The House '' , located on Fish Island , in Bow in east London .   The show was a mix of news , weather , interviews , audience phone-ins and general features , with a light tone which was in competition with the more serious GMTV and even more serious BBC Breakfast programmes .   History   The Big Breakfast was launched at the end of September 1992 to replace The Channel Four Daily , which was Channel 4 's unsuccessful first dip into the breakfast television market between 1989 and 1992 . The Daily , launched at huge expense , had possessed an analytical style , focusing largely on current affairs , news bulletins and cerebral quiz shows ; however , this format had failed to earn enough viewing figures , and consequently Channel 4 opted to change direction and work towards a lighter style concentrating mainly on entertainment and humour .   The first two presenters were Chris Evans ( from 1992 to 1994 ) and Gaby Roslin ( 1992 to 1996 ) . At its height in 1993 , viewing figures reached around two million per edition , and it was the highest rated UK breakfast television programme . Along with Evans and Roslin , Bob Geldof presented a short-lived political interview slot . His wife Paula Yates became notorious with her interviews conducted lying on a bed , and the puppet characters Zig and Zag created morning mayhem in the bathroom with Evans in a slot called 'The Crunch ' .   As part of his contract with The Big Breakfast , Evans was committed to developing a new show for Channel 4 .

In an attempt to stem the sliding viewing figures , the Big Breakfast house was refurbished at a cost of \u00a32 million . New presenters Rick Adams and Sharron Davies were brought in but viewing figures fell dramatically . Davies left the programme in early 1997 , to be replaced by Denise van Outen . Van Outen had initially been brought in as part of the September 1996 relaunch as a traffic and travel presenter , before being given a role based at the house as the phone room presenter and holiday relief for Davies .

It is the ancestor of domestic cattle . The species survived in Europe until the last recorded aurochs died in the Jaktor\u00f3w Forest , Poland in 1627 .   During the Neolithic Revolution , which occurred during the early Holocene , there were at least two aurochs domestication events : one related to the Indian subspecies , leading to zebu cattle ; the other one related to the Eurasian subspecies , leading to taurine cattle . Other species of wild bovines were also domesticated , namely the wild water buffalo , gaur , and banteng . In modern cattle , numerous breeds share characteristics of the aurochs , such as a dark colour in the bulls with a light eel stripe along the back ( the cows being lighter ) , or a typical aurochs-like horn shape .   Taxonomy   The aurochs was variously classified as Bos primigenius , Bos taurus , or , in old sources , Bos urus . However , in 2003 , the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature `` conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species , which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms '' , confirming Bos primigenius for the aurochs . Taxonomists who consider domesticated cattle a subspecies of the wild aurochs should use B. primigenius taurus ; those who consider domesticated cattle to be a separate species may use the name B. taurus , which the Commission has kept available for that purpose .   Etymology   The words aurochs , urus , and wisent have all been used synonymously in English . However , the extinct aurochs/urus is a completely separate species from the still-extant wisent , also known as European bison . The two were often confused , and some 16th-century illustrations of aurochs and wisents have hybrid features .  The word urus ( ; plural uri ) is a Latin word , but was borrowed into Latin from Germanic ( cf . Old English/Old High German \u016br , Old Norse \u00far ) . In German , OHG \u016br was compounded with ohso `` ox '' , giving \u016brohso , which became early modern Aurochs . The modern form is Auerochse .   The word aurochs was borrowed from early modern German , replacing archaic urochs , also from an earlier form of German . The word is invariable in number in English , though sometimes back-formed singular auroch and innovated plural aurochses occur . The use in English of the plural form ' is nonstandard , but mentioned in The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language . It is directly parallel to the German plural Ochsen ( singular Ochse ) and recreates by analogy the same distinction as English ox ( singular ) and oxen ( plural ) .   Evolution     During the Pliocene , the colder climate caused an extension of open grassland , which led to the evolution of large grazers , such as wild bovines . Bos acutifrons is an extinct species of cattle that has been suggested as an ancestor for the aurochs .   The oldest aurochs remains have been dated to about 2 million years ago , in India . The Indian subspecies was the first to appear . During the Pleistocene , the species migrated west into the Middle East ( western Asia ) as well as to the east . They reached Europe about 270,000 years ago . The South Asian domestic cattle , or zebu , descended from Indian aurochs at the edge of the Thar Desert ; the zebu is resistant to drought . Domestic yak , gayal and banteng do not descend from aurochs .   The first complete mitochondrial genome ( 16,338 base pairs ) DNA sequence analysis of `` Bos primigenius '' from an archaeologically verified and exceptionally well preserved aurochs bone sample was published in 2010 .   Three wild subspecies of aurochs are recognized . Only the Eurasian subspecies survived until recent times .  * The Eurasian aurochs ( Bos primigenius primigenius ) once ranged across the steppes and taigas of Europe , Siberia , and Central Asia , and East Asia . It is noted as part of the Pleistocene megafauna , and declined in numbers along with other megafauna species by the end of Pleistocene . The Eurasian aurochs were domesticated into modern taurine cattle breeds around the 6th millennium BC in the Middle East", "modContext": "The aurochs ( or ; pl . primigenius taurus ; taurus , which the Commission has kept available for that purpose .

) is the largest island in the Windward group of French Polynesia ; this overseas collectivity of the French Republic is sometimes referred to as an overseas country . The island is located in the archipelago of the Society Islands in the central Southern Pacific Ocean , and is divided into two parts : The bigger , northwestern part Tahiti Nui and the smaller , southeastern part Tahiti Iti . The island was formed from volcanic activity and is high and mountainous with surrounding coral reefs . The population is 183,645 inhabitants ( 2012 census ) , making it the most populous island of French Polynesia and accounting for 68.5 % of its total population .   Tahiti is the economic , cultural and political centre of French Polynesia . The capital of the collectivity , Pape'ete , is located on the northwest coast with the only international airport in the region , Fa ' a ' \u0101 International Airport , situated 5 km from the town centre .   Tahiti was originally settled by Polynesians between 300 and 800 CE . They represent about 70 % of the island 's population with the rest made up of Europeans , Chinese and those of mixed heritage .   The island was part of the Kingdom of Tahiti until its annexation by France in 1880 , when it was proclaimed a colony of France . It was not until 1946 that the indigenous Tahitians were legally authorised to be French citizens . French is the only official language although the Tahitian language ( Reo Tahiti ) is widely spoken .   Geography   Tahiti is the highest and largest island in French Polynesia lying close to Moorea island . It is located 4400 km south of Hawaii , 7900 km from Chile and 5700 km from Australia .   The island is 45 km across at its widest point and covers an area of 1045 km2 . The highest peak is Mont Orohena ( Mou ' a 'Orohena ) ( 2241 m ) . Mount Roonui , or Mount Ronui ( Mou ' a R\u014dnui ) in the southeast rises to 1332 m. The island consists of two roughly round portions centred on volcanic mountains and connected by a short isthmus named after the small town of Taravao , situated there .   The northwestern portion is known as Tahiti Nui ( `` big Tahiti '' ) , while the much smaller southeastern portion is known as Tahiti Iti ( `` small Tahiti '' ) or Tai'arap\u016b . Tahiti Nui is heavily populated along the coast , especially around the capital , Papeete .   The interior of Tahiti Nui is almost entirely uninhabited . Tahiti Iti has remained isolated , as its southeastern half ( Te Pari ) is accessible only to those travelling by boat or on foot . The rest of the island is encircled by a main road which cuts between the mountains and the sea .   A scenic and winding interior road climbs past dairy farms and citrus groves with panoramic views . Tahiti 's landscape features lush rainforests and many streams , including the Papenoo River on the north side .   Climate   November to April is the wet season , the wettest month of which is January with of rain in Papeet\u0113 . August is the driest with .   The average temperature ranges between 21 and with little seasonal variation . The lowest and highest temperatures recorded in Papeete are 16 and , respectively .   History   Prehistoric colonization of Tahiti   The first Tahitians arrived from Southeast Asia in about 200 BCE , after a long migration from South East Asia or Indonesia , via the Fijian , Samoan and Tongan Archipelagos . This hypothesis of an emigration from Southeast Asia is supported by a number of linguistic , biological and archaeological proofs . For example , the languages of Fiji and Polynesia all belong to the same Oceanic sub-group , Fijian-Polynesian , which itself forms part of the great family of the Austronesian Languages .   This emigration , across several hundred kilometres of ocean , was made possible by using outrigger canoes that were up to twenty or thirty meters long and could transport families as well as domestic animals . In 1769 , for instance , James Cook mentions a great traditional ship ( va ' a ) in Tahiti that was 33 m long , and could be propelled by sail or paddles .  In 2010 , an expedition on a simple outrigger canoe with a sail retraced the route back from Tahiti to Asia", "modContext": " this overseas collectivity of the French Republic is sometimes referred to as an overseas country .

Traben-Trarbach with its art nouveau architecture and Bernkastel-Kues with its traditional market square are two of the many popular tourist attractions on the Moselle river .   Name   The name Moselle is derived from the Celtic name form , Moseal , via the Latin Mosella , a diminutive form of Mosa , the Latin description of the Meuse , which used to flow parallel to the Moselle . So the Mosella was the `` Little Meuse '' .   The Moselle is first recorded by Tacitus in Book 13 of his Annals and in Book 4 of his Histories .   The Roman poet , Decimius Magnus Ausonius , made it a literary theme as early as the 4th century . In his poem dated A.D. 371 , called Mosella , which was published in 483 hexameters , this poet of the Late Antiquity and teacher at the Trier Imperial Court ( Kaiserhof ) described a journey from Bingen over the Hunsr\u00fcck hills to the Moselle and then following its course to Trier on the road named after him , the Via Ausonius . Ausonius describes flourishing and rich landscapes along the river and in the valley of the Moselle , thanks to the policies of their Roman rulers .   The river subsequently gave its name to two French republican d\u00e9partements : Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle .

After 544 kilometres it discharges into the Rhine at the Deutsches Eck in Koblenz at a height of 59 metres above NHN . The length of the river in France is 314 kilometres , for 39 kilometres it forms the border between Germany and Luxembourg , and 208 kilometres are solely within Germany .   The Moselle flows through the Lorraine region , west of the Vosges . Further downstream , in Germany , the Moselle valley forms the division between the Eifel and Hunsr\u00fcck mountain regions .

The term ' is Medieval Latin , which means in the year of the Lord but is often translated as in the year of our Lord . It is occasionally set out more fully as ' ( or Jesu ) ' ( `` in the year of Our Lord Jesus Christ '' ) .  Dionysius Exiguus of Scythia Minor introduced the AD system in AD 525 , counting the years since the birth of Christ .   This calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth , with AD counting years from the start of this epoch , and BC denoting years before the start of the era . There is no year zero in this scheme , so the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1 BC . This dating system was devised in 525 , but was not widely used until after 800 .   The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today . For decades , it has been the unofficial global standard , adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication , transportation , and commercial integration , and recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations .   Traditionally , English followed Latin usage by placing the `` AD '' abbreviation before the year number . However , BC is placed after the year number ( for example : AD , but 68 BC ) , which also preserves syntactic order . The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium , as in `` fourth century AD '' or `` second millennium AD '' ( although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions ) . Because BC is the English abbreviation for Before Christ , it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means After Death , i.e. , after the death of Jesus . However , this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would not be included in either of the BC and the AD time scales .   Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current , or Common Era ( abbreviated as CE or C.E . ) , with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common , Christian , or Current Era ( BCE or B.C.E . ) . Astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity , but use the same numbers for AD years .   History   The Anno Domini dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus to enumerate the years in his Easter table . His system was to replace the Diocletian era that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians . The last year of the old table , Diocletian 247 , was immediately followed by the first year of his table , AD 532 . When he devised his table , Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year\u2014he himself stated that the `` present year '' was `` the consulship of Probus Junior '' , which was 525 years `` since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ '' . Thus Dionysius implied that Jesus ' Incarnation occurred 525 years earlier , without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred . `` However , nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system , whether consulate , Olympiad , year of the world , or regnal year of Augustus ; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date . ''   Blackburn & Holford-Strevens briefly present arguments for 2 BC , 1 BC , or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the Nativity or Incarnation . Among the sources of confusion are :  * In modern times , Incarnation is synonymous with the conception , but some ancient writers , such as Bede , considered Incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity  * The civil , or consular year began on 1 January but the Diocletian year began on 29 August ( 30 August in the year before a Julian leap year ) .  * There were inaccuracies in the list of consuls  * There were confused summations of emperors ' regnal years", "modContext": "C .

Terminology   Drag queen   The etymology of the term `` drag queen '' is disputed . The term drag queen occurred in Polari , a subset of English slang that was popular in some gay communities in the early part of the 20th century . Its first recorded use to refer to actors dressed in women 's clothing is from 1870 .   A folk etymology is that drag is an acronym of `` Dressed Resembling A Girl '' in description of male theatrical transvestism .   Queen may refer to the trait of affected royalty found in the personalities of many who do drag ( whether this is their normal personality or a character created for the stage ) . It is also related to the Old English word `` quean '' or cwene , which originally simply meant `` woman '' , then was later used as a label both for promiscuous women and gay men ( see Oxford English Dictionary definition number 3 for `` queen '' ) .  The OE word apprears derived from  Middle Dutch quene ( `` old woman '' ) , ultimately from  Proto-Germanic * kwen\u01ed ( `` woman '' ) , from Proto-Indo-European * g\u02b7\u1e17n ( `` woman '' ) .   Drag as a term referring to women 's clothing worn by men has less clear origins . According to one theory , it was used in reference to transvestites at least as early as the 18th century , owing to the tendency of their skirts to drag on the ground . Another possibility is that it derives from the Romani word for skirt , which appears in a number of Romani dialects of Northern Europe with forms like daraka and jendraka .

It is one of the communities , regions and language areas of Belgium . The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming , while the corresponding adjective is Flemish . The official capital of Flanders is Brussels , although Brussels itself has an independent regional government , and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life .   Historically , the name referred to the County of Flanders ( Flandria ) , which around AD 1000 stretched from the Strait of Dover to the Scheldt estuary . The only parts of historical Flanders situated within modern-day Flanders are the provinces West Flanders and East Flanders . Nevertheless , during the 19th and 20th centuries it became increasingly commonplace to use the term `` Flanders '' to refer to the entire Dutch-speaking part of Belgium , stretching all the way to the River Maas . In accordance with late 20th century Belgian state reforms the area was made into two political entities : the `` Flemish Community '' ( ) and the `` Flemish Region '' ( ) . These entities were merged , although geographically the Flemish Community , which has a broader cultural mandate , covers Brussels , whereas the Flemish Region does not .   Flanders has figured prominently in European history . During the late Middle Ages , cities such as Ghent , Bruges , Antwerp and Brussels made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe , weaving the wool of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export . As a consequence , a very sophisticated culture developed , with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture , rivaling those of northern Italy . Belgium was one of the centres of the 19th century industrial revolution but Flanders was at first overtaken by French-speaking Wallonia . In the second half of the 20th century , however , Flanders ' economy modernised rapidly , and today Flanders is significantly more wealthy than its southern counterpart .   Geographically , Flanders is generally flat , and has a small section of coast on the North Sea . Much of Flanders is agriculturally fertile and densely populated , with a population density of almost 500 people per square kilometer ( 1,200 per square mile ) . It borders France to the west , the Netherlands to the north and east , and Wallonia to the south . The Brussels Capital Region is an enclave within the Flemish Region . Flanders has exclaves of its own : Voeren in the east is between Wallonia and the Netherlands and Baarle-Hertog in the north consists of 22 exclaves surrounded by the Netherlands .

It comprises 6.5 million Belgians ( 60 % ) who consider Dutch to be their mother tongue .  * The political subdivisions of Belgium : the Flemish Region ( competent in mainly economic matters ) and the Flemish Community ( competent in mainly cultural matters ) . The first does not comprise Brussels ( which forms a Region on itself ) , whereas the latter does .  * The political institutions that govern both subdivisions : the operative body `` Flemish Government '' and the legislative organ `` Flemish Parliament '' .  * The two westernmost provinces of the Flemish Region , West Flanders and East Flanders , forming the central portion of the historic County of Flanders .   In Belgium and neighbouring countries   * A feudal territory that existed from the 8th century ( Flandria ) until its absorption by the French First Republic . Until the 1600s , this county also extended over parts of France and the Netherlands .  * One of the regions conquered by the French in Flanders , namely French Flanders in the Nord department . French Flanders can be divided into two smaller regions : Lilloise Flanders and Maritime Flanders . The first region was predominantly French-speaking already in the 1600s , the latter became so in the 20th century .

of Sumatra , Indonesia . The shock had a moment magnitude of 9.1\u20139.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX ( Violent ) . The undersea megathrust earthquake was caused when the Indian Plate was subducted by the Burma Plate and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean , killing 230,000 people in 14 countries , and inundating coastal communities with waves up to 30 m high . It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history . Indonesia was the hardest-hit country , followed by Sri Lanka , India , and Thailand .   It is the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph and had the longest duration of faulting ever observed , between 8.3 and 10 minutes . It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1 cm and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska . Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia . The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response . In all , the worldwide community donated more than US $ 14 billion ( 2004 ) in humanitarian aid . The event is known by the scientific community as the Sumatra\u2013Andaman earthquake . The resulting tsunami was given various names , including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , South Asian tsunami , Indonesian tsunami , the Christmas tsunami and the Boxing Day tsunami .   Earthquake characteristics   The earthquake was initially documented as moment magnitude 8.8 . In February 2005 scientists revised the estimate of the magnitude to 9.0 . Although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has accepted these new numbers , the United States Geological Survey has so far not changed its estimate of 9.1 . The most recent studies in 2006 have obtained a magnitude of Mw 9.1\u20139.3 . Dr. Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology believes that Mw 9.2 is a good representative value for the size of this great earthquake .   The hypocentre of the main earthquake was approximately 160 km off the western coast of northern Sumatra , in the Indian Ocean just north of Simeulue island at a depth of 30 km below mean sea level ( initially reported as 10 km ) . The northern section of the Sunda megathrust ruptured over a length of 1300 km . The earthquake ( followed by the tsunami ) was felt simultaneously in Bangladesh , India , Malaysia , Myanmar , Thailand , Singapore and the Maldives . Splay faults , or secondary `` pop up faults '' , caused long , narrow parts of the sea floor to pop up in seconds . This quickly elevated the height and increased the speed of waves , causing the complete destruction of the nearby Indonesian town of Lhoknga .   Indonesia lies between the Pacific Ring of Fire along the north-eastern islands adjacent to New Guinea , and the Alpide belt that runs along the south and west from Sumatra , Java , Bali , Flores to Timor .   Great earthquakes such as the Sumatra-Andaman event , which are invariably associated with megathrust events in subduction zones , have seismic moments that can account for a significant fraction of the global earthquake moment across century-scale time periods . Of all the seismic moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005 , roughly one-eighth was due to the Sumatra-Andaman event . This quake , together with the Good Friday earthquake ( Alaska , 1964 ) and the Great Chilean earthquake ( 1960 ) , account for almost half of the total moment . The much smaller but still catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake is included in the diagram for perspective . Mw denotes the magnitude of an earthquake on the moment magnitude scale .   Since 1900 the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake ( magnitude 9.5 ) and the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Prince William Sound ( 9.2 ) . The only other recorded earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater were off Kamchatka , Russia , on 4 November 1952 ( magnitude 9.0 ) and T\u014dhoku , Japan ( magnitude 9.0 ) in March 2011 . Each of these megathrust earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean . However , the death toll from these was significantly lower , primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas and the much greater distances to more populated coasts and also due to the superior infrastructure and warning systems in MEDCs ( More Economically", "modContext": " The shock had a moment magnitude of 9.1\u20139.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX ( Violent ) .

The organization was the first Nazi Party intelligence organization to be established and was considered a sister organization with the Gestapo , which the SS had infiltrated heavily after 1934 . Between 1933 and 1939 , the SD was administered as an independent SS office , after which it was transferred to the authority of the Reich Main Security Office ( Reichssicherheitshauptamt ; RSHA ) , as one of its seven departments/offices . Its first director , Reinhard Heydrich , intended for the SD to bring every single individual within the Third Reich 's reach under `` continuous supervision . ''   Following Germany 's defeat in World War II , the SD was declared a criminal organisation at the Nuremberg Trials , along with the rest of Heydrich 's RSHA ( including the Gestapo ) both individually and as branches of the SS in the collective . Heydrich 's successor , Ernst Kaltenbrunner , was sentenced to death for war crimes at the Nuremberg Tribunals and hanged in 1946 .   History   The SD was one of the oldest security organizations of the SS and was first formed in 1931 as the Ic-Dienst , operating out of a single apartment and reporting directly to Heinrich Himmler . Himmler appointed a former naval officer , Reinhard Heydrich , to organise the small agency . The office was renamed Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ) in the summer of 1932 . The SD became more powerful after the Nazis took control of Germany and the SS started infiltrating all leading positions of the security apparatus of the Reich . Even before Hitler came to power , the SD was a veritable `` watchdog '' over the SS and members of the Nazi Party and played a critical role in consolidating political police powers into the hands of Himmler and Heydrich .   Growth of SD and SS power   Once Hitler was appointed Chancellor by German President , Paul von Hindenburg , he quickly made efforts to manipulate the aging president . On 28 February 1933 , Hitler convinced Hindenburg to declare a state of emergency which suspended all civil liberties throughout Germany , due at least in part to the Reichstag fire the night before , assuring Hindenburg throughout that he was attempting to stabilize the tumultuous political scene in Germany by taking a `` defensive measure against Communist acts of violence endangering the state . '' Wasting no time , Himmler set the SD in motion as they began creating an extensive card index of the Nazi regime 's political opponents , arresting labor organizers , socialists , Jewish leaders , journalists , and communists in the process , sending them to their new prison facility near Munich , Dachau . Himmler 's SS and SD made their presence felt at once by helping rid the regime of its known political enemies and its perceived ones , as well . As far as Heydrich and Himmler were concerned , the SD left their mission somewhat vaguely defined so as to `` remain an instrument for all eventualities . '' One of those eventualities would soon arise .   For a while , the SS was in \u2018 competition \u2019 with the Sturmabteilung ( SA ) for influence within the Third Reich . Himmler distrusted the SA and came to deplore the \u2018 rabble-rousing \u2019 brownshirts ( despite once having been a member ) and what they considered to be the indecent sexual deviants amid its leadership . At least one pretext to secure additional influence for Himmler 's SS and Heydrich 's SD in `` protecting '' Hitler and securing his absolute trust in their intelligence collection abilities involved thwarting a plot from Ernst Roehm 's SA using subversive means .   On 20 April 1934 Hermann G\u00f6ring handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler . Heydrich , named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934 , also continued as head of the SD . These events further extended Himmler \u2019 s control of the security mechanism of the Reich , which by proxy also strengthened the surveillance power of Heydrich \u2019 s SD , as both entities methodically infiltrated every police agency in Germany . Thereafter , the SD was made the sole `` Party information service '' on 9 June 1934 .

Battle account   The battle took place at Kerreri , 11 km north of Omdurman . Kitchener commanded a force of 8,000 British regulars and a mixed force of 17,000 Sudanese and Egyptian troops . He arrayed his force in an arc around the village of Egeiga , close to the bank of the Nile , where a twelve gunboat flotilla waited in support , facing a wide , flat plain with hills rising to the left and right . The British and Egyptian cavalry were placed on either flank .   Abdullah 's followers , known as Ansar and sometimes referred to as Dervishes , numbered around 50,000 , including some 3,000 cavalry . They were split into five groups\u2014a force of 8,000 under Osman Azrak was arrayed directly opposite the British , in a shallow arc along a mile ( 1.6 km ) of a low ridge leading onto the plain , and the other Mahdist forces were initially concealed from Kitchener 's force . Abdullah al-Taashi and 17,000 men were concealed behind the Surgham Hills to the west and rear of Osman Azrak 's force , with 20,000 more positioned to the north-west , close to the front behind the Kerreri hills , commanded by Ali-Wad-Helu and Sheikh ed-Din . A final force of around 8,000 was gathered on the slope on the right flank of Azrak 's force .   The battle began in the early morning , at around 6:00 a.m. After the clashes of the previous day , the 8,000 men under Osman Azrak advanced straight at the waiting British , quickly followed by about 8,000 of those waiting to the northwest , a mixed force of rifle and spear-men . The 52 quick firing guns of the British artillery opened fire at around 2750 m , inflicting severe casualties on the Mahdist forces before they even came within range of the Maxim guns and volley fire . The frontal attack ended quickly , with around 4,000 Mahdist casualties ; none of the attackers got closer than 50 m to the British trenches . A flanking move from the Ansar right was also checked , and there were bloody clashes on the opposite flank that scattered the Mahdist forces there .   Kitchener was anxious to occupy Omdurman before the remaining Mahdist forces could withdraw there . He advanced his army on the city , arranging them in separate columns for the attack . The British light cavalry regiment , the 21st Lancers , was sent ahead to clear the plain to Omdurman . They had a tough time of it . The 400-strong regiment attacked what they thought were only a few hundred dervishes , but in fact there were 2,500 infantry hidden behind them in a depression . After a fierce clash , the Lancers drove them back ( resulting in three Victoria Crosses being awarded to Lancers who helped rescue wounded comrades ) . One of the participants of this fight was Lieutenant Winston Churchill . On a larger scale , the British advance allowed the Khalifa to re-organize his forces . He still had over 30,000 men in the field and directed his main reserve to attack from the west while ordering the forces to the northwest to attack simultaneously over the Kerreri Hills .   Kitchener 's force wheeled left in echelon to advance up Surgham ridge and then southwards . To protect the rear , a brigade of 3,000 mainly Sudanese , commanded by Hector MacDonald , was reinforced with Maxims and artillery and followed the main force at around 1350 m.

"Hrunting was a sword given to Beowulf by Unferth in the ancient Old English epic poem Beowulf . Beowulf used it in battle against Grendel 's Mother .   Beowulf is described receiving the sword in lines 1455-1458 :   `` And another item lent by Unferth  at that moment of need was of no small importance :  the brehon handed him a hilted weapon ,  a rare and ancient sword named Hrunting .  The iron blade with its ill-boding patterns  had been tempered in blood . It had never failed  the hand of anyone who hefted it in battle ,  anyone who had fought and faced the worst  in the gap of danger . This was not the first time  it had been called to perform heroic feats .   However , although the sword possessed great power and was claimed to have never failed anyone who used it , when Beowulf descended to the bottom of the lake to fight Grendel 's mother , the sword proved ineffective . As the `` fabulous powers of that heirloom failed , '' Beowulf was forced to discard it .   Hrunting 's significance   Swords have great significance in the war-centred Anglo-Saxon culture from which Beowulf arises . Therefore , emphasis is strongly placed on the exchange of weapons of war . Weapons such as swords circulated through Anglo-Saxon society as inheritance through family , birthed through the monsters , found under magic rocks , and as rewards between lords and their subjects . Occasionally such exchange was also seen between warriors . One example of a weapon as a gift is seen in the exchange of Hrunting . As Unferth passes his sword to Beowulf , he admits the loss of his glory , and his submission to this greater warrior . However , when Hrunting fails Beowulf in his battle against Grendel 's mother , it possibly reflects its previous owner , Unferth , who failed to defeat the hated Grendel . In addition , Beowulf \u2019 s defeat of Grendel prompts the Danish king Hrothgar to bestow upon him many gifts consisting of weapons ; this further emphasizes the importance of weaponry to such a society . Beowulf then passes on his rewards to his king Hygelac , thereby establishing his obligation to his king . Hrunting \u2019 s various meanings demonstrate that weapons of war can carry not only positive , but also negative , significance .   Symbolism of Hrunting   Unferth \u2019 s very act of giving Hrunting to Beowulf and the sword \u2019 s unexpected failure in the battle against Grendel \u2019 s mother bear much symbolism in the poem . Given that Unferth shows his dislike for Beowulf early in the story , Unferth \u2019 s choice to award Beowulf with Hrunting , which means \u201c thrusting , \u201d can be interpreted as a sign of peace and acceptance . In this light , the giving of the sword seems to be an indication of Unferth \u2019 s recognition of Beowulf as a capable and powerful warrior . On the other hand , the poem portrays Unferth as a sly and treacherous man . Furthermore , scholars even propose that Hrunting is \u201c the very sword with which [ Unferth ] slew his own kin. \u201d Ettlinger , Ellen ( 1943 ) .

Date Accessed : March 30 , 2009. p. 10 It is possible then that Unferth 's motive in giving away his sword upon being confronted with the problem of Grendel 's mother could very well be to avoid going into battle . The passing of Hrunting from Unferth 's hand to Beowulf is therefore a reflection of Unferth 's treachery as he abandons his role as a warrior of Heorot . At first glance , Unferth 's sudden act of generosity towards Beowulf appears to have been done for noble reasons . However , what is known about Unferth and the sword 's inefficacy in battle strongly suggest that Unferth 's intentions are cowardly rather than noble - something reinforced by the similarly equivocal role played by the sword 's `` hafted '' counterpart in Grettis Saga .   Hrunting 's failure   The reason behind Hrunting 's failing against Grendel 's Mother has been a point of much scholarly debate . J.L . Rosier , in A Design for Treachery : The Unferth Intrigue , puts forth the contention that Unferth deliberately gave Beowulf a sword that he knew would fail , possibly for the", "modContext": " Beowulf used it in battle against Grendel 's Mother .

Under a variety of names , they were common to the stories of all Germanic peoples , although they are perhaps best known from Scandinavian folklore . The related English knucker was generally depicted as a wyrm or dragon , although more recent versions depict the spirits in other forms . Their sex , bynames , and various transformations vary geographically . The German Nix and his Scandinavian counterparts were males . The German Nixe was a female river mermaid .   Names and etymology   The names are held to derive from Common Germanic * nikwus or * nikwis ( i ) , derived from PIE * neigw ( `` to wash '' ) . They are related to Sanskrit n\u1e17n\u0113kti , Greek \u03bd\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 n\u00edz\u014d and \u03bd\u03af\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9 n\u00edpt\u014d , and Irish nigh ( all meaning to wash or be washed ) . The form neck appears in English and Swedish ( n\u00e4ck or nek , meaning `` nude '' ) . The Swedish form is derived from Old Swedish neker , which corresponds to Old Icelandic nykr ( gen. nykrs ) , and nykk in Norwegian Nynorsk . In Finnish , the word is n\u00e4kki . In Old Danish , the form was nikke and in modern Danish and Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l it is n\u00f8kk . The Icelandic nykur is a horselike creature . In Middle Low German , it was called necker and in Middle Dutch nicker ( c.f . also Nickel or Nikkel plus Kobolt ) . The Old High German form nihhus also meant `` crocodile '' , while the Old English nicor could mean both a `` water monster '' like those encountered by Beowulf , and a `` hippopotamus '' . The Norwegian Fossegrim and Swedish Str\u00f6mkarlen are related figures sometimes seen as by-names for the same creature . The Scandinavian version can transform himself into a horse-like kelpie , and is called a B\u00e4ckah\u00e4sten ( the `` brook horse '' ) , whilst the Welsh version is called the Ceffyl D\u0175r ( the `` water horse '' ) .   England   In the English county of Sussex , there are said to dwell `` water-wyrms '' called knuckers . The Word knucker is derived from the Old English nicor . English folklore contains many creatures with similarities to the Nix or N\u00e4ck . These Necks include Jenny Greenteeth , the Shellycoat , Peg Powler , the B\u00e4ckah\u00e4sten-like Brag , and the Grindylow .   Scandinavia   N\u00e4ck , N\u00f8kk   The Scandinavian n\u00e4cken , n\u00e4kki , n\u00f8kk were male water spirits who played enchanted songs on the violin , luring women and children to drown in lakes or streams . However , not all of these spirits were necessarily malevolent ; in fact , many stories exist that indicate at the very least that n\u00f8kker were entirely harmless to their audience and attracted not only women and children , but men as well with their sweet songs . Stories also exist where in the Fossegrim agreed to live with a human who had fallen in love with him , but many of these stories ended with the n\u00f8kk returning to his home , usually a nearby waterfall or brook .

He could show himself as a man playing the violin in brooks and waterfalls ( though often imagined as fair and naked today , in actual folklore he was more frequently wearing more or less elegant clothing ) but also could appear to be treasure or various floating objects or as an animal\u2014most commonly in the form of a `` brook horse '' ( see below ) .

Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world , with the world 's 12th-largest economy . In 2014 Australia had the world 's fifth-highest per capita income .

Name   The name Australia ( pronounced in Australian English ) is derived from the Latin Terra Australis ( `` southern land '' ) a name used for putative lands in the southern hemisphere since ancient times . The earliest recorded use of the word Australia in English was in 1625 in `` A note of Australia del Esp\u00edritu Santo , written by Sir Richard Hakluyt '' , published by Samuel Purchas in Hakluytus Posthumus , a corruption of the original Spanish name `` Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo '' ( Southern Land of the Holy Spirit ) for an island in Vanuatu . The Dutch adjectival form Australische was used in a Dutch book in Batavia ( Jakarta ) in 1638 , to refer to the newly discovered lands to the south .  The first time that the name Australia appears to have been officially used was in a despatch to Lord Bathurst of 4 April 1817 in which Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledges the receipt of Matthew Flinders ' charts of Australia . On 12 December 1817 , Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted . In 1824 , the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia .   History   Prehistory   Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago , possibly with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea-crossings from what is now Southeast Asia . These first inhabitants may have been ancestors of modern Indigenous Australians . At the time of European settlement in the late 18th century , most Indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers , with a complex oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime . The Torres Strait Islanders , ethnically Melanesian , were originally horticulturists and hunter-gatherers . The northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically by fishermen from Maritime Southeast Asia .

He wakes up to find out that Coral and all but one of the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda . Marlin names this last egg Nemo , a name that Coral liked .   Nemo develops a smaller right fin as a result of damage to his egg during the attack , which limits his swimming ability . Worried about Nemo 's safety , Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip . Nemo sneaks away from the reef and is captured by scuba divers . As the boat departs , a diver accidentally knocks his diving mask overboard . While attempting to save Nemo , Marlin meets Dory , a good-hearted and optimistic regal blue tang with short-term memory loss . Marlin and Dory meet three sharks \u2013 Bruce , Anchor and Chum \u2013 who claim to be vegetarians . Marlin discovers the diver 's mask and notices an address written on it .

During a hazardous struggle with an anglerfish in the trench , Dory sees the diving mask and reads the address located at 42 Wallaby Way , Sydney , NSW . The pair swims on , receiving directions to Sydney from a school of moonfish . Marlin and Dory encounter a bloom of jellyfish that nearly kills them . Marlin loses consciousness and wakes up on a sea turtle named Crush , who takes Marlin and Dory on the East Australian Current . Marlin tells the details of his long journey with a group of sea turtles , and his story is spread across the ocean . He also sees how Crush gets along well with his son Squirt .   Meanwhile , Nemo is placed in a fish tank in the office of a naive dentist named Phillip Sherman in Sydney Harbour . He meets aquarium fish called the Tank Gang , led by a moorish idol named Gill , who has a broken fin .

It is the home ground for the New South Wales Blues cricket team , the Sydney Sixers of the Big Bash League and the Sydney Swans Australian Football League club . It is owned and operated by the SCG Trust that also manages the Sydney Football Stadium located next door . Until the 44,000 seat Football Stadium was opened in 1988 , the Sydney Cricket Ground was the major rugby league venue in Sydney .   History   In 1811 , the Governor of New South Wales , Lachlan Macquarie , established the second Sydney Common , about one-and-a-half miles wide and extending south from South Head Rd ( now Oxford St ) to where Randwick Racecourse is today . Part sandhills , part swamp and situated on the south-eastern fringe of the city , it was used as a rubbish dump in the 1850s and not regarded as an ideal place for sport . In 1851 , part of the Sydney Common south of Victoria Barracks was granted to the British Army for use as a garden and cricket ground for the soldiers . Its first user was the 11th North Devonshire Regiment which flattened and graded the southern part of the rifle range adjacent to the Barracks .   In the next couple of years , the teams from Victoria Barracks combined themselves into a more permanent organisation and called themselves the Garrison Club . The ground therefore became known as the Garrison Ground when it was first opened in February 1854 .   Up until that time Hyde Park had been the main sporting and racing ground in the colony but when it was dedicated as public gardens in 1856 city cricketers and footballers had to find somewhere else to play .   In the late 1860s another part of the Sydney Common , the area west of the Garrison Ground to the then Dowling Street , was opened for public recreation . It was named Moore Park after the Mayor of Sydney , Charles Moore , who planted a number of Moreton Bay Fig trees which exist to this day . As well as the location of Sydney 's first zoo , Moore Park was a regular venue for games between Sydney rugby clubs Sydney University and the Wallaroos . Sydney at the time was a small , dense city and best navigated on foot and Moore Park was on the outskirts . It was not liked so much by cricketers because it was too far from the city .   When the commander of the Sydney garrison , Lieutenant-Colonel John Richardson , aligned his soldiers to the East Sydney Cricket Club , the Garrison Ground became known as the Civil and Military Ground . In 1870 British troops left Victoria barracks and the future of the Civil and Military Ground became uncertain . However , with the closure of the Albert Ground in the 1870s , the NSW Cricket Association ( NSWCA ) began regular use of the Civil and Military Ground .   In 1875 the NSW Government began to upgrade the ground . Despite efforts by Victoria Barracks and then the Carlingford , Redfern , Fitzroy and Albert cricket clubs to take control , the then president of the NSWCA , Richard Driver ( after whom Driver Avenue outside the ground is named ) , persuaded the government to let the NSWCA look after the ground 's administration . In 1876 , the ground was dedicated by Governor Sir Hercules Robinson .   The NSWCA had influential supporters . Driver himself was a prominent MP and solicitor for the City of Sydney Council . The Minister for Lands , Thomas Garrett , was also supportive ; his son was about to break into the colonial side . It is hardly surprising therefore that within a couple of years of the NSWCA taking control of the ground , the governor , Sir Hercules Robinson , appointed Driver himself , William W. Stephen and Phillip Sheridan ( after whom a grandstand was named ) , the first trustees . Two trustees were appointed by the government and one by the NSWCA .

wickets '' in the United States ) embedded in a grass playing court .   History   The oldest document to bear the word croquet with a description of the modern game is the set of rules registered by Isaac Spratt in November 1856 with the Stationers ' Company in London . This record is now in the Public Record Office . In 1868 , the first croquet all-comers ' meet was held at Moreton-in-Marsh , Gloucestershire and in the same year the All England Croquet Club was formed at Wimbledon , London .   Regardless when and by what route it reached England and the British colonies in its recognizable form , croquet is , like golf , pall-mall , trucco , and kolven , among the later forms of ground billiards , which as a class have been popular in Western Europe back to at least the Late Middle Ages , with roots in classical antiquity , including sometimes the use of arches and pegs along with and balls and mallets or other striking sticks ( some more akin to modern field hockey sticks ) . By the 12th century , a team ball game called ' or ' , akin to a chaotic version of hockey or football ( depending on whether sticks were used ) , was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes ; it was attested in Cornwall as early as 1283 .   In the book Queen of Games : The History of Croquet , Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet , which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas .   The first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to Britain from France during the 1630\u20131685 reign of Charles II of England , and was played under the name of ' ( among other spellings , today usually pall-mall ) , derived ultimately from Latin words for ' '' ball and mallet ' ( the latter also found in the name of the earlier French game , ' ) . This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica , dated 1877 . In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England , Joseph Strutt , in 1611 , described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time : `` Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box [ wood ] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron , which he that can do at the fewest blows , or at the number agreed upon , wins . It is to be observed , that there are two of these arches , that is one at either end of the alley . The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second , and the walk in Saint James 's Park , now called the Mall , received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall , where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime . ''   While the name pall-mall and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere ( France and Italy ) , the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century . Some other early modern sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance ( as in golf ) , however an image in Strutt 's 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game ( balls on ground , hoop , bats and peg ) being played over a , garden-sized distance . The image 's caption describes the game as `` a curious ancient pastime '' , confirming that croquet games were not new in early nineteenth century England .   In Samuel Johnson 's 1755 dictionary , his definition of `` pall-mall '' clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet : `` A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring '' . However , there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game .   The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from Ireland during the 1850s , perhaps after being brought there from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches .

Clocks , watches , clockwork , sundials , hourglasses , clepsydras , timers , time recorders , marine chronometers and atomic clocks are all examples of instruments used to measure time . In current usage , horology refers mainly to the study of mechanical time-keeping devices , while chronometry more broadly includes electronic devices that have largely supplanted mechanical clocks for the best accuracy and precision in time-keeping .   People interested in horology are called horologists . That term is used both by people who deal professionally with timekeeping apparatus ( watchmakers , clockmakers ) , as well as aficionados and scholars of horology . Horology and horologists have numerous organizations , both professional associations and more scholarly societies .   Museums and libraries   There are many horology museums and several specialized libraries devoted to the subject . One example is the Royal Greenwich Observatory , which is also the source of the Prime Meridian ( longitude 0\u00b0 0 ' 0 '' ) , and the home of the first marine timekeepers accurate enough to determine longitude ( made by John Harrison ) . Other horological museums in the London area include the Clockmakers ' Museum , which re-opened at the Science Museum in October 2015 , and the horological collections at the British Museum , the Science Museum ( London ) and at the Wallace Collection .

Appointed as the project 's principal investigator , Stern was described by Krimigis as `` the personification of the Pluto mission '' . New Horizons was based largely on Stern 's work since Pluto 350 and involved most of the team from Pluto Kuiper Express . The New Horizons proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA . It was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study , in June 2001 .

In November 2001 , New Horizons was officially selected for funding as part of the New Frontiers program . However , the new NASA Administrator appointed by the Bush Administration , Sean O'Keefe , was not supportive of New Horizons , and effectively cancelled it by not including it in NASA 's budget for 2003 .

Retrieved March 13 , 2006 .   South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region . Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles site because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups . They settled on the Mount Rushmore location , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure . Robinson wanted it to feature western heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud , and Buffalo Bill Cody , but Borglum decided the sculpture should have a more national focus and chose the four presidents whose likenesses would be carved into the mountain . After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of `` Mount Rushmore 's great political patron '' , U.S . Senator Peter Norbeck , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 . Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over construction . Although the initial concept called for each president to be depicted from head to waist , lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 .   Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States , and has appeared in works of fiction , and has been discussed or depicted in other popular works . It attracts over two million people annually .   History   Originally known to the Lakota Sioux as `` The Six Grandfathers '' , the mountain was renamed after Charles E. Rushmore , a prominent New York lawyer , during an expedition in 1885 . At first , the project of carving Rushmore was undertaken to increase tourism in the Black Hills region of South Dakota . After long negotiations involving a Congressional delegation and President Calvin Coolidge , the project received Congressional approval . The carving started in 1927 , and ended in 1941 with no fatalities .   As Six Grandfathers , the mountain was part of the route that Lakota leader Black Elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at Harney Peak .

Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles site because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups . Robinson wanted it to feature western heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud , and Buffalo Bill Cody , but Borglum decided the sculpture should have a more national focus and chose the four presidents whose likenesses would be carved into the mountain . Senator Peter Norbeck , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 . Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over construction .

The term camel is derived via Latin and Greek ( camelus and \u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 kam\u0113los respectively ) from Hebrew or Phoenician g\u0101m\u0101l .   `` Camel '' is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like mammals in the family Camelidae : the two true camels and the four New World camelids : the llama , alpaca , guanaco , and vicu\u00f1a of South America .   Biology   The average life expectancy of a camel is 40 to 50 years . A full-grown adult camel stands at the shoulder and at the hump . Camels can run at up to 65 km/h in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to 40 km/h . Bactrian camels weigh 300 to and dromedaries 300 to .   The male dromedary camel has in its throat an organ called a dulla , a large , inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in rut to assert dominance and attract females . It resembles a long , swollen , pink tongue hanging out of the side of its mouth . Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground , with the male mounting from behind . The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session . Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position .   Ecological and behavioral adaptations   Camels do not directly store water in their humps as was once commonly believed . The humps are actually reservoirs of fatty tissue : concentrating body fat in their humps minimizes the insulating effect fat would have if distributed over the rest of their bodies , helping camels survive in hot climates . When this tissue is metabolized , it yields more than one gram of water for every gram of fat processed . This fat metabolization , while releasing energy , causes water to evaporate from the lungs during respiration ( as oxygen is required for the metabolic process ) : overall , there is a net decrease in water .   Camels have a series of physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand long periods of time without any external source of water . Unlike other mammals , their red blood cells are oval rather than circular in shape . This facilitates the flow of red blood cells during dehydration and makes them better at withstanding high osmotic variation without rupturing when drinking large amounts of water : a 600 kg camel can drink 200 L of water in three minutes .   Camels are able to withstand changes in body temperature and water consumption that would kill most other animals . Their temperature ranges from 34 \u00b0C at dawn and steadily increases to 40 \u00b0C by sunset , before they cool off at night again . Maintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for animals ; to assist this , camels have a rete mirabile , a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain . Camels rarely sweat , even when ambient temperatures reach 49 \u00b0C . Any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat ; the heat of vaporization therefore comes from body heat rather than ambient heat . Camels can withstand losing 25 % of their body weight to sweating , whereas most other mammals can withstand only about 12\u201314 % dehydration before cardiac failure results from circulatory disturbance .   When the camel exhales , water vapor becomes trapped in their nostrils and is reabsorbed into the body as a means to conserve water . Camels eating green herbage can ingest sufficient moisture in milder conditions to maintain their bodies ' hydrated state without the need for drinking .   The camels ' thick coats insulate them from the intense heat radiated from desert sand ; a shorn camel must sweat 50 % more to avoid overheating . During the summer the coat becomes lighter in", "modContext": " bactrianus ) , which inhabits Central Asia .

It is one of the three prairie provinces ( with Alberta and Saskatchewan ) and Canada 's fifth-most populous province with its estimated population of about 1.3 million people . Manitoba covers 649950 km2 with a widely varied landscape . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south .   Aboriginal peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived in the area when it was part of Rupert 's Land and owned by the Hudson 's Bay Company . In 1867 , negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba led to an armed uprising of the M\u00e9tis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the rebellion led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 , officially creating the province of Manitoba .   Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is Canada 's eighth-largest Census Metropolitan Area . Winnipeg is the seat of government , home to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and the Provincial Court . Four of the province 's five universities and all four of its professional sports teams are in Winnipeg .  Other cities in the province are Brandon , Portage la Prairie , Steinbach , Thompson , Winkler , Selkirk , Dauphin , Morden , and Flin Flon .   Etymology   The name Manitoba is believed to be derived from the Cree , Ojibwe or Assiniboine languages . The name derives from Cree manitou-wapow or Ojibwa manidoobaa , both meaning `` straits of Manitou , the Great Spirit '' , a place referring to what are now called The Narrows in the centre of Lake Manitoba . It may also be from the Assiniboine for `` Lake of the Prairie '' .   The lake was known to French explorers as Lac des Prairies . Thomas Spence chose the name to refer to a new republic he proposed for the area south of the lake . M\u00e9tis leader Louis Riel also chose the name , and it was accepted in Ottawa under the Manitoba Act of 1870 .   Geography   Manitoba is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . It adjoins Hudson Bay to the northeast , and is the only prairie province to have a saltwater coastline . The Port of Churchill is the only arctic deep-water port in Canada and the shortest shipping route between North America and Asia . Lake Winnipeg is the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world . Hudson Bay is the second-largest bay in the world . Manitoba is at the heart of the giant Hudson Bay watershed , once known as Rupert 's Land . It was a vital area of the Hudson 's Bay Company , with many rivers and lakes that provided excellent opportunities for the lucrative fur trade .   Hydrography and terrain   The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and contains over 110,000 lakes , covering approximately 15.6 percent or 101593 km2 of its surface area . Manitoba 's major lakes are Lake Manitoba , Lake Winnipegosis , and Lake Winnipeg , the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world . Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on the east side of Lake Winnipeg are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site .   Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin , with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay . This basin 's rivers reach far west to the mountains , far south into the United States , and east into Ontario . Major watercourses include the Red , Assiniboine , Nelson , Winnipeg , Hayes , Whiteshell and Churchill rivers . Most of Manitoba 's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz .

Ian Kevin Huntley , a caretaker at local secondary school Soham Village College , was convicted on 17 December 2003 of the girls ' murder and sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment , with the High Court later setting a minimum term of 40 years .   His girlfriend , Maxine Ann Carr , was the girls ' teaching assistant at St Andrew 's Primary School . Carr had provided Huntley with a false alibi and received a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for perverting the course of justice .   Murders   On Sunday , 4 August 2002 , Wells and Chapman had attended a barbecue at Wells ' home in Redhouse Gardens , Soham . At around 6:15 pm , they went out to buy some sweets . On their way back they walked past the home of Ian Huntley , a secondary school caretaker , in College Close . Huntley saw the girls and asked them to come into his house . He said that his girlfriend , Maxine Carr , their teaching assistant at St Andrew 's Primary School , was in the house too . She had in fact gone to visit family in Grimsby , Lincolnshire . Shortly after the girls entered his house , Huntley murdered them .   Huntley 's motive for killing Wells and Chapman may never be known , but minutes before seeing them he had reportedly slammed the telephone down on Carr following a furious argument ; Huntley had allegedly suspected Carr of cheating on him . The police suspected that Huntley killed the girls in a fit of jealous rage . Huntley 's mother also said that she suspected this . The police found no evidence of premeditation .   Investigation   After the girls were reported missing , the police released photographs \u2013 taken only hours before their disappearance \u2013 of them wearing Manchester United replica football shirts and a physical description of each of them , describing them as `` white , about 4 ft 6 in tall and slim '' .

''   In the early days of the investigation , a woman living in the nearby village of Little Thetford claimed to have seen two girls whose appearance and clothing matched those of Wells and Chapman walking past her home on the morning after they were reported missing . Police also seized a white van from a caravan park in Wentworth , some 10 miles from Soham , on 7 August .   Police received information from a local taxi driver that the driver of a green car ( either a Peugeot 405 or Vauxhall Vectra ) was seen struggling with two children and driving `` erratically '' south of Soham and onto the Studlands Park housing estate in Newmarket on the evening the girls went missing . This sighting was made public on 13 August . That evening , a dog walker alerted police to two mounds of earth at Warren Hill , just outside Newmarket . The suggestion was that these might be the graves of the two missing girls . However , an overnight examination revealed that the mounds of earth were badger setts , and no trace of either girl was found .   Around the same time , police in Staffordshire claimed that the disappearance of the girls was linked to an abduction in the county the previous year , where a six-year-old girl had survived an attack by an abductor who was still at large and whose green Ford Mondeo was identified as having numberplates which had been stolen in Peterborough .

Championships is a hardcourt tennis tournament . The tournament is the modern version of one of the oldest tennis championships in the world , the U.S. National Championship , for which men 's singles was first contested in 1881 . Since 1987 , the US Open has been chronologically the fourth and final tennis major comprising the Grand Slam each year ; the other three , in chronological order , are the Australian Open , the French Open and Wimbledon .   The US Open is held annually , starting on the last Monday in August , and lasting for two weeks into September , with the middle weekend coinciding with the Labor Day holiday . The main tournament consists of five event championships : men 's and women 's singles , men 's and women 's doubles , and mixed doubles , with additional tournaments for senior , junior , and wheelchair players . Since 1978 , the tournament has been played on acrylic hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park , Queens , New York City . The US Open is owned and organized by the United States Tennis Association ( USTA ) , a not-for-profit organization . Net proceeds from ticket sales , sponsorships , and television deals are used to promote the development of tennis in the United States .   The US Open is the only Grand Slam that employs tiebreakers in every set of a match . For the other three Grand Slam events , if a match goes to the last set ( the third for women , fifth for men ) and there is a 6\u20136 tie , the match continues until one player wins by two games ( i.e . 8-6 , 9-7 , 10-8 , etc . ) , while in all four Grand Slam events , the sets played before the last set always employ tiebreakers should a set reach 6-6 .   History   Newport Casino   The tournament was first held in August 1881 on the grass courts at the Newport Casino , Newport , Rhode Island and in that first year only clubs that were members of the United States National Lawn Tennis Association ( USNLTA ) were permitted to enter . The first edition was won by Richard Sears , who went on to win seven consecutive singles titles . From 1884 through 1911 , the tournament used a challenge system whereby the defending champion automatically qualified for the next year 's final in which he would play the winner of the all-comers tournament . In 1915 the national championship was relocated from Newport , Rhode Island to the West Side Tennis Club at Forest Hills , New York ; as early as 1911 an effort was made by a group of tennis players , headed by Karl Behr from New York , to relocate the tournament to New York .   West Side Tennis Club   In early 1915 the issue resurfaced when a group of about 100 tennis players signed a petition in favor of the move , arguing that most tennis clubs , players and fans were located in the New York area and that it would therefore be beneficial for the development of the sport to host the national championship there . This view was opposed by another group of players which included eight former national singles champions . The contentious issue was brought to a vote at the annual USNLTA meeting on February 5 , 1915 and with 128 votes in favor and 119 against it was decided to relocate .   From 1921 through 1923 , the tournament was played at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia . It returned to Forest Hills in 1924 following the completion of the newly constructed 14,000 seat concrete Forest Hills Stadium . Though regarded unofficially by many as a major championship beforehand , the tournament was officially designated as one of the major tournaments by the ILTF commencing in 1924 .

The Oedipus complex occurs in the third \u2014 phallic stage ( ages 3\u20136 ) \u2014 of the five psychosexual development stages : ( i ) the oral , ( ii ) the anal , ( iii ) the phallic , ( iv ) the latent , and ( v ) the genital \u2014 in which the source of libidinal pleasure is in a different erogenous zone of the infant 's body . The Oedipal complex originally refers to the sexual desire of a son for his mother and does not have to be reciprocated .   Sigmund Freud , who coined the term `` Oedipus complex '' , believed that the Oedipus complex is a desire for the parent in both males and females ; he deprecated the term `` Electra complex '' , which was introduced by Carl Gustav Jung in regard to the Oedipus complex manifested in young girls . Freud further proposed that boys and girls experience the complex differently : boys in a form of castration anxiety , girls in a form of penis envy ; and that unsuccessful resolution of the complex might lead to neurosis , pedophilia , and homosexuality .

; 14 November 1840 \u2013 5 December 1926 ) was a founder of French Impressionist painting , and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement 's philosophy of expressing one 's perceptions before nature , especially as applied to plein-air landscape painting . The term `` Impressionism '' is derived from the title of his painting Impression , soleil levant ( Impression , Sunrise ) , which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris .   Monet 's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons . From 1883 Monet lived in Giverny , where he purchased a house and property , and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works . In 1899 he began painting the water lilies , first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature , and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life .   Monet and Impressionism   First `` Impressionist '' exhibition   From the late 1860s , Monet and other like-minded artists met with rejection from the conservative Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts , which held its annual exhibition at the Salon de Paris . During the latter part of 1873 , Monet , Pierre-Auguste Renoir , Camille Pissarro , and Alfred Sisley organized the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme des artistes peintres , sculpteurs et graveurs ( Anonymous Society of Painters , Sculptors , and Engravers ) to exhibit their artworks independently . At their first exhibition , held in April 1874 , Monet exhibited the work that was to give the group its lasting name .   Impression , Sunrise was painted in 1872 , depicting a Le Havre port landscape . From the painting 's title the art critic Louis Leroy , in his review , `` L'Exposition des Impressionnistes , '' which appeared in Le Charivari , coined the term `` Impressionism '' .

It is one of the three branches of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic , together with the Army and the Air Force . Each ship of the Argentine Navy is designated with the prefix `` ARA '' before its name .   The Argentine Navy day is celebrated on May 17 , anniversary of the victory achieved in 1814 in the Battle of Montevideo over the Spanish fleet during the war of Independence .   History   19th century   The Argentine Navy was created in the aftermath of the May Revolution of May 25 , 1810 , which started the war for independence from Spain . The navy was first created to support Manuel Belgrano in the Paraguay campaign , but it was sunk by ships from Montevideo , and did not take part in that conflict . Renewed conflicts with Montevideo led to the creation of a second fleet , which participated in the capture of the city . As Buenos Aires had little maritime history , most men in the navy were from other nations , such as the Irish-born admiral William Brown , who directed the operation . As the cost of maintaining a navy was too high , most of the Argentine naval forces were composed of privateers .   Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata .   In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself . At the close of the century , the force included :   * 5 armoured cruisers  * 4 coastal defence ironclads  * 3 second-class , high-speed , British-built cruisers  * 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats  * 4 destroyers and  * 22 torpedo boats .   The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships : , , and , each at over 6,000 tons . Three older ironclads , , , and dated from the 1880s and early 1890s .   The navy 's ships were built primarily in Italy , Britain , France , and Spain and were operated by over 600 officers and 7760 seamen . These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery .   20th century   Argentina remained neutral in both world wars . In 1940 , Argentina 's navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world ( after the European powers , Japan , and the United States ) and the largest in Latin America . A ten-year building programme costing $ 60 million had produced a force of 14,500 sailors and over a thousand officers . The fleet included two First World War-era ( but modernized ) American-built s , three modern cruisers , a dozen British-built destroyers , and three submarines in addition to minelayers , minesweepers , coastal defence ships , and gunboats . A naval air force was also in operation .   In the postwar period , Naval Aviation and Marine Corps units were put under direct Navy command . With Brazil , Argentina is one of two South American countries to have operated two aircraft carriers : the and .   The Argentine Navy has been traditionally heavily involved in fishery inspection helping the Coast Guard : most notably in 1966 a destroyer fired on and holed a Soviet trawler that had refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata , in the 1970s there were four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships and continued in recent years .   The Navy also took part in all military coups through the 20th century . During the last dictatorship , Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War of the late 1970s in which thousands of people were kidnapped , tortured and killed by the forces of the Military Junta . The Naval Mechanics School , known as ESMA , was a notorious centre for torture . Among their more well-known victims were the Swedish teenager Dagmar Hagelin and French nuns , Alice Domon and L\u00e9onie Duquet ( In October 2007 the Argentine Navy formally handed possession of the school to human rights groups to turn into a memorial museum ) .

Names   In Russian , `` Grozny '' means `` fearsome '' , `` awesome '' , or `` redoubtable '' , the same word as in Ivan Grozny or Ivan the Terrible . While the official name in Chechen is the same , informally the city is known as `` '' , which literally means `` the city ( ) on the Sunzha River ( ) '' .   In 1996 , during the First Chechen War , the Chechen separatists renamed the city Dzokhar-Ghala ( ) , or Dzhokhar/Djohar for short , after Dzhokhar Dudayev , the first President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria . In December 2005 , the Chechen parliament voted to rename the city `` Akhmadkala '' ( after Akhmad Kadyrov ) \u2014a proposition which was rejected by his son Ramzan Kadyrov , the prime minister and later President of the republic .   History   Russian fort   The fortress of Groznaya ( ; lit . fearsome ) was founded in 1818 as a Russian military outpost on the Sunzha River by general Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov . As the fort was being built the workers were fired upon by the Chechens . The Russians solved the problem by placing a cannon at a carefully chosen point outside the walls . When night fell and the Chechens came out of their hiding places to drag the gun away all the other guns opened up with grapeshot . When the Chechens recovered their senses and began to carry away the bodies the guns fired again . When it was over 200 dead were counted . Thus did the 'terrible ' fort receive its baptism of fire . It was a prominent defense center during the Caucasian War . After the annexation of the region by the Russian Empire , the military use of the old fortress was obsolete and in December 1869 it was renamed Grozny and granted town status .

This encouraged the rapid development of industry and petrochemical production . In addition to the oil drilled in the city itself , the city became a geographical center of Russia 's network of oil fields , and in 1893 became part of the Transcaucasia \u2014 Russia Proper railway . The result was the population almost doubled from 15,600 in 1897 to 30,400 in 1913 .   Soviet regional capital   One day after the October Revolution , on November 8 , 1917 , the Bolsheviks headed by N. Anisimov seized Grozny . As the Russian Civil War escalated , the Proletariat formed the 12th Red Army , and the garrison held out against numerous attacks by Terek Cossacks from August 11 to November 12 , 1918 . However , with the arrival of Denikin 's armies , the Bolsheviks were forced to withdraw and Grozny was captured on February 4 , 1919 by the White Army . Underground operations were carried out , but only the arrival of the Caucasus front of the Red Army in 1920 allowed the city to permanently end up with the Russian SFSR on March 17 . Simultaneously it became part of the Soviet Mountain Republic , which was formed on January 20 , 1921 , and was the capital of the Chechen National Okrug inside it .   On November 30 , 1922 , the mountain republic was dissolved , and the national okrug became the Chechen Autonomous Oblast ( Chechen AO ) with Grozny as the administrative center . At this time most of the population was still Russian , but of Cossack descent . As Cossacks were viewed as a potential threat to the Soviet nation , Moscow actively encouraged the migration of Chechens into the city from the mountains . In 1934 the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Oblast was formed , becoming the Chechen-Ingush ASSR in 1936 .   In 1944 , the entire population of Chechens and Ingush was deported after rebelling against Soviet rule .

At the forefront of politics for fifty years , he held many political and cabinet positions .

His Principal Private Secretary Bernard Woolley , played by Derek Fowlds , is usually caught between the two . The sequel , Yes , Prime Minister , continued with the same cast and followed the events of the premiership of Jim Hacker after his unexpected elevation to Number 10 upon the resignation of the previous Prime Minister .   The series received a number of awards , including several BAFTAs and in 2004 was voted sixth in the Britain 's Best Sitcom poll . It was the favourite television programme of the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Margaret Thatcher .   Situation   The series opens in the wake of a general election in which the incumbent government has been defeated by the opposition party , to which Jim Hacker MP belongs . His party affiliation is never stated , and his party emblem is clearly neither Conservative nor Labour . The Prime Minister offers Hacker the position of Minister of Administrative Affairs , which he accepts . Hacker goes to his department and meets his Permanent Secretary , Sir Humphrey Appleby , and his Principal Private Secretary , Bernard Woolley . While Appleby is outwardly deferential towards the new minister , he is prepared to defend the status quo at all costs . Woolley is sympathetic towards Hacker but as Appleby reminds him , his civil servant superiors will have much to say about the course of his future career , while ministers do not usually stay long in one department . Many of the episodes revolve around proposals backed by Hacker but frustrated by Appleby , and others revolve around proposals promoted by the latter but rejected by Hacker , which Appleby attempts by all means necessary to persuade Hacker to accept . They do occasionally join forces in order to achieve a common goal , such as preventing the closure of their department or dealing with a diplomatic incident .   As the series revolves around the inner workings of central government , most of the scenes take place in private locations , such as offices and exclusive members ' clubs . Lynn says that `` there was not a single scene set in the House of Commons because government does not take place in the House of Commons . Some politics and much theatre takes place there . Government happens in private . As in all public performances , the real work is done in rehearsal , behind closed doors . Then the public and the House are shown what the government wishes them to see . '' However , the episode `` The Compassionate Society '' does feature an audio recording of Yesterday in Parliament in which Hacker speaks in the House of Commons , and other episodes include scenes in the Foreign Secretary 's House of Commons office ( `` The Writing on the Wall '' ) and a Committee room ( `` A Question of Loyalty '' ) . At the time of the making of the series , television cameras were not allowed in the House of Commons and had only recently been introduced into the House of Lords , so it was not unusual to a British audience to have no scenes from there .   Character contrast   The different ideals and self-interested motives of the characters are frequently contrasted . Whilst Hacker occasionally approaches an issue from a sense of idealism and a desire to be seen to improve things , he ultimately sees his re-election and elevation to higher office as the key measures of his success . Accordingly , he must appear to the voters to be effective and responsive to the public will .", "modContext": " In total there were 39 episodes , of which all but two lasted half an hour .

It was used in the United Kingdom , and earlier in Great Britain and England . Similar denominations were later used throughout the British Empire , notably in Australia , New Zealand , and South Africa .   The sum of three pence was pronounced variously , or , reflecting different pronunciations in the various regions and nations of the United Kingdom . Likewise , the coin was often referred to in conversation as a , or bit .   Before Decimal Day in 1971 there were two hundred and forty pence in one pound sterling . Twelve pence made a shilling , and twenty shillings made a pound . Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence , e.g . forty-two pence would be three shillings and six pence ( 3/6 ) , pronounced `` three and six '' . Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence , e.g . eight pence would be 8d .   Early threepences   The three pence coin \u2013 expressed in writing as `` 3d '' \u2013 first appeared in England during the fine silver coinage of King Edward VI ( 1547\u201353 ) , when it formed part of a set of new denominations . Although it was an easy denomination to work with in the context of the old sterling coinage system , being a quarter of a shilling , initially it was not popular with the public who preferred the groat ( four pence ) . Hence the coin was not minted in the following two reigns .   Edward VI threepences were struck at the London and York mints . The obverse shows a front-facing bust of the king , with a rose to the left and the value numeral III to the right , surrounded by the legend . The reverse shows a long cross over the royal shield , surrounded by the legend ( London mint ) ( I have made God my helper ) , or ( York mint ) ( City of York ) .   Queen Elizabeth I ( 1558\u20131603 ) produced threepences during her third coinage ( 1561\u20131577 ) . Most 1561 issues are 21 mm in diameter , while later ones are 19 mm in diameter . These coins are identifiable from other denominations by the rose behind the queen 's head on the obverse , and the date on the reverse . The obverse shows a left-facing crowned bust of the queen with a rose behind her , surrounded by the legend , while the reverse shows shield over a long cross , dated 1561 , surrounded by the legend . Dates used for the smaller coins were 1561\u201377 . Threepences of the fourth coinage ( 1578\u20131582 ) are identical except for having a slightly lower silver content . There was also a fairly rare milled coinage threepence , produced between 1561 and 1564 with similar designs and inscriptions to the hammered coinage threepences .   The threepence denomination fell out of use again during the reign of King James I , while during King Charles I 's reign ( 1625\u201349 ) it was not produced at the London Tower mint , but was produced ( sometimes in some quantity ) at various provincial mints . The denomination is identified by the numeral III appearing behind the king 's head .   Threepences reintroduced   By far the most common Charles I threepences were produced at the Aberystwyth mint between 1638 and 1642 . They feature a left-facing crowned bust of the king with plumes in front of his face and the numeral III behind him , with the legend ( or a combination of M ( A ) B F ( R ) ET H ( I ) ( B ) depending on the engraver ) , with the reverse showing the royal arms on a large oval shield with plumes above the shield , and the legend \u2013 I reign under the auspices of Christ . Plumes were the identifying symbol of the Aberystwyth mint , but the Bristol and Oxford mints often used dies from the Aberystwyth mint so plumes often appear on their output too .

Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom , and the state was consequently renamed the `` United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland '' .   The period began with the newly formed United Kingdom defeating the French Empire in 1814 in the Napoleonic Wars . The British Empire thereby became the foremost world power for the next century . Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century . In Ireland , this was focused along the eastern seaboard and north of the island , leading to deepening of economic and social disparities . A devastating famine , exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century , led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland , and increased calls for Irish land reform and the devolution of executive power . During and after World War I , the rise of Irish nationalism and physical force republicanism eventually culminated in the Irish War of Independence , and in 1922 the partition of Ireland between the newly founded Irish Free State and the northeast , which opted to remain part of the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland .

The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland headed the government on behalf of the monarch . He was assisted by the Chief Secretary of Ireland . Both were responsible to the government in London rather than to the Parliament of Ireland . Before the Constitution of 1782 , the Irish parliament was also severely fettered , and decisions in Irish courts could be overturned on appeal to the British House of Lords in London .   Ireland gained a degree of independence in the 1780s thanks to Henry Grattan . During this time the effects of the Penal Laws on the majority Roman Catholic population ( and the dissenter minority ) were reduced , and some property-owning Catholics were granted the franchise in 1794 ; however , they were still excluded from becoming members of the Irish House of Commons . This brief period of limited independence came to an end following the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , which occurred during the British war with revolutionary France . The British government 's fear of an independent Ireland siding against them with the French resulted in the decision to unite the two countries . This was brought about by legislation in the parliaments of both kingdoms and came into effect on 1 January 1801 . The Irish had been led to believe by the British that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated for with Catholic Emancipation , i.e . by the removal of civil disabilities placed upon Roman Catholics in both Great Britain and Ireland .

When the Treaty of Amiens ended the war , Britain agreed to return most of the territories it had seized . The peace settlement was in effect only a ceasefire , and Napoleon continued to provoke the British by attempting a trade embargo on the country and by occupying the city of Hanover , capital of the Electorate , a German-speaking duchy which was in a personal union with the United Kingdom .

This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history . It is also known for its several important artistic movements , especially the Renaissance period . After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna , the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire , until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 , following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence .

His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright .   Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna , and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 , at age 49 , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive , which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , sexuality , and religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others .   Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613 . His early plays were primarily comedies and histories , and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres . He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608 , including Hamlet , Othello , King Lear , and Macbeth , considered some of the finest works in the English language . In his last phase , he wrote tragicomedies , also known as romances , and collaborated with other playwrights .   Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime . In 1623 , however , John Heminges and Henry Condell , two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare , published a more definitive text known as the First Folio , a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare 's . It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson , in which Shakespeare is hailed , presciently , as `` not of an age , but for all time '' .The Norton Anthology of English Literature : Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century , Volume B , 2012 , pg . 1168   In the 20th and 21st centuries , his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance . His plays remain highly popular , and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world .   Life   Early life   William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare , an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield , and Mary Arden , the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer . He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564 . His actual date of birth remains unknown , but is traditionally observed on 23 April , Saint George 's Day . This date , which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar 's mistake , has proved appealing to biographers , because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 . He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son .   Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered in 1553 , about a quarter-mile ( 400 m ) from his home . Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era , but grammar school curricula were largely similar : the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors .   At the age of 18 , Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway . The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582 . The next day , two of Hathaway 's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage .

Nevertheless , it is still considered one of the most peculiarly perilous airports in the world .   History   Madeira Airport was officially opened on 18 July 1964 , with two 1600 m runways . The first flight ever to land was a TAP Air Portugal Lockheed Constellation with 80 passengers on board .   In 1972 , the popularity of visiting the island of Madeira increased , so the runway had to be extended to allow modern and larger aircraft to land . Considered the Kai Tak of Europe because of its singular approach to runway 05 , the decision was made to extend the existing runway , instead of building a new one . In the meantime , a brand new terminal was built at the airport in 1973 , handling 500,000 passengers .   Between 1982 and 1986 , Madeira 's runway was successfully extended by 200 m to a total of 1800 m , and also four gates were opened . The original runway was only 1600 m long , but was extended by 200 m 8 years after the TAP Portugal Flight 425 crash of 1977 .   In 2000 , the runway was again extended this time to 2781 m almost doubling the size of the original runway . As landfill was not a realistic option , the extension was built on a platform , partly over the ocean , supported by 180 columns , each about 70 m tall . The extension of Madeira Airport was conducted by the Brazilian construction company Andrade Gutierrez , and is recognized worldwide as one of the most difficult to achieve due to the type of terrain and orography .   The new runway and terminal were inaugurated on 6 October 2002 , and to mark the occasion , an Air-Atlantic Iceland Boeing 747-267B , registration TF-ABA , landed at the airport . Although this was a rare event , some TAP Portugal flights make scheduled stops at Madeira with wide bodied A330-200 aircraft on the Lisbon-Caracas-Lisbon route .   In 2004 , Dr. Manabu Ito , President of the International Association of Bridge and Structural Engineering ( IABSE ) , presented the IABSE Outstanding Structure Award in Shanghai : the enlargement of the new runway at Funchal Airport won the 2004 Outstanding Structure Award ( considered the Oscars of worldwide structural engineering ) by the IABSE .   The History Channel program Most Extreme Airports ranked it as the 9th most dangerous airport in the world , and the third most dangerous in Europe after Gibraltar International Airport and Courchevel Altiport .   On 23 July 2016 , it was announced that the airport will be renamed after famous footballer , Cristiano Ronaldo .   Terminal   The airport has a single terminal which opened in 1973 . The terminal has 40 check-in desks , 16 boarding gates and 7 baggage belts . There are no air-bridges so passengers either walk the short distance to the terminal or are taken by shuttle bus . The terminal itself is mostly underground .   Airlines and destinations   Busiest routes   Accidents and incidents   * On 5 March 1973 , an Aviaco Sud Caravelle 10R ( Registration EC-BID ) crashed into the sea during the landing approach , losing the aircraft and three crew .   * On 19 November 1977 , TAP Portugal Flight TP425 , a Boeing 727-200 ( Registration CS-TBR ) was traveling from Brussels to Madeira via Lisbon . After a go-around , the aircraft attempted to land in poor weather conditions . It landed long on runway 24 ( now runway 23 ) and plunged over a steep bank . It then struck a stone bridge and the right wing", "modContext": " Its innovative solution allowed Funchal to receive the Outstanding Structure Award in 2004 by the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering , which aims at recognizing the most remarkable , innovative , creative or otherwise stimulating structure completed within the last few years .

The ideal of the kouros ( a beardless , athletic youth ) , Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music , truth and prophecy , healing , the sun and light , plague , poetry , and more . Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto , and has a twin sister , the chaste huntress Artemis . Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu .   As the patron of Delphi ( Pythian Apollo ) , Apollo was an oracular god\u2014the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle . Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo , whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius , yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague . Amongst the god 's custodial charges , Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists , and as the patron defender of herds and flocks . As the leader of the Muses ( Apollon Musegetes ) and director of their choir , Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry . Hermes created the lyre for him , and the instrument became a common attribute of Apollo . Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans .   In Hellenistic times , especially during the 3rd century BCE , as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios , Titan god of the sun , and his sister Artemis similarly equated with Selene , Titan goddess of the moon .

Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE .   Etymology   The name of Apollo itself\u2014though not Paean , a possible name of a precursor god to or epithet of him\u2014is generally considered to be absent from the Linear B ( Mycenean Greek ) texts although it is possible that the name is in fact attested in the lacunose form ] pe-rjo- [ ( Linear B : ] - [ ) on the KN E 842 tablet .

It is also called Japanese horseradish , although horseradish is a different plant ( which is generally used as a substitute for wasabi , due to the scarcity of the wasabi plant ) . Its stem is used as a condiment and has an extremely strong pungency more akin to hot mustard than the capsaicin in a chili pepper , producing vapours that stimulate the nasal passages more than the tongue . The plant grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan . The two main cultivars in the marketplace are E. japonicum 'Daruma ' and 'Mazuma ' , but there are many others .  The origin of wasabi cuisine has been clarified from the oldest historical records ; it takes its rise in Nara prefecture .   Uses   Wasabi is generally sold either as a stem , which must be very finely grated before use , as dried powder in large quantities , or as a ready-to-use paste in tubes similar to travel toothpaste tubes . Because it grows mostly submerged , it is a common misconception to refer to the part used for wasabi as a root or sometimes even a rhizome : it is in fact the stem of the plant , with the characteristic leaf scar where old leaves fell off or were collected .   In some high-end restaurants , the paste is prepared when the customer orders , and is made using a grater to grate the stem ; once the paste is prepared , it loses flavour in 15 minutes if left uncovered . In sushi preparation , sushi chefs usually put the wasabi between the fish and the rice because covering wasabi until served preserves its flavor .   Fresh wasabi leaves can be eaten , having the spicy flavor of wasabi stems .   Legumes ( peanuts , soybeans , or peas ) may be roasted or fried , then coated with wasabi powder mixed with sugar , salt , or oil and eaten as a crunchy snack .   Surrogates   Wasabi is difficult to cultivate , and that makes it quite expensive . Outside Japan , it is rare to find real wasabi plants . Due to its high cost , a common substitute is a mixture of horseradish , mustard , starch and green food coloring or spinach powder . Often packages are labeled as wasabi while the ingredients do not actually include wasabi plant . Wasabi and horseradish are similar in taste and pungency due to similar isothiocyanate levels . The primary difference between the two is color with Wasabi being naturally green . In Japan , horseradish is referred to as . In the United States , true wasabi is generally found only at specialty grocers and high-end restaurants .   Chemistry   The chemical in wasabi that provides for its initial pungency is the volatile allyl isothiocyanate , which is produced by hydrolysis of natural thioglucosides ( conjugates of the sugar glucose , and sulfur-containing organic compounds ) ; the hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by myrosinase and occurs when the enzyme is released on cell rupture caused by maceration \u2013 e.g. , grating \u2013 of the plant . The same compound is responsible for the pungency of horseradish and mustard .   The unique flavor of wasabi is a result of complex chemical mixtures from the broken cells of the plant , including those resulting from the hydrolysis of thioglucosides into glucose and methylthioalkyl isothiocyanates :   * 6-methylthiohexyl isothiocyanate  * 7-methylthioheptyl isothiocyanate  * 8-methylthiooctyl isothiocyanate   Research has shown that such isothiocyanates inhibit microbe growth , perhaps with implications for preserving food against spoilage and suppressing oral bacterial growth .   Because the burning sensations of wasabi are not oil-based , they are short-lived compared to the effects of chili peppers , and are washed away with more food or liquid . The sensation is felt primarily in the nasal passage and can be quite painful depending on the amount consumed . Inhaling or sniffing wasabi vapor has an effect like smelling salts , a property exploited by researchers attempting to create a smoke alarm for the deaf . One deaf subject participating in a test of the prototype awoke within 10 seconds of wasabi vapor sprayed into his sleeping chamber .

West Africa has been defined as including the 18 countries Benin , Burkina Faso , the island of Cape Verde , Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , the island of Saint Helena , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Sao Tome and Principe and Togo .   History   The history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods : first , its prehistory , in which the first human settlers arrived , developed agriculture , and made contact with peoples to the north ; the second , the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-African , and extra-African trade , and developed centralized states ; third , major polities flourished , which would undergo an extensive history of contact with non-Africans ; fourth , the colonial period , in which Great Britain and France controlled nearly the whole of the region ; and fifth , the post-independence era , in which the current nations were formed .   Prehistory   Early human settlers from northern Holocene societies arrived in West Africa around 12,000 B.C . Sedentary farming began in , or around the fifth millennium B.C , as well as the domestication of cattle . By 1500 B.C , ironworking technology allowed an expansion of agricultural productivity , and the first city-states later formed . Northern tribes developed walled settlements and non-walled settlements that numbered at 400 . In the forest region , Iron Age cultures began to flourish , and an inter-region trade began to appear . The desertification of the Sahara and the climatic change of the coast cause trade with upper Mediterranean peoples to be seen .   The domestication of the camel allowed the development of a trans-Saharan trade with cultures across the Sahara , including Carthage and the Berbers ; major exports included gold , cotton cloth , metal ornaments and leather goods , which were then exchanged for salt , horses , textiles , and other such materials . Local leather , cloth , and gold also contributed to the abundance of prosperity for many of the following empires .   Empires   The development of the region 's economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form , beginning with the Nok culture that began in 1000 B.C . and the Ghana Empire that first flourished between the 1st and 3rd centuries , which later gave way to the Mali Empire . In current-day Mauritania , there exist archaeological sites in the towns of Tichit and Oualata that were initially constructed around 2000 B.C. , and were found to have originated from the Soninke branch of the Mand\u00e9 peoples . Also , based on the archaeology of city of Kumbi Saleh in modern-day Mauritania , the Mali empire came to dominate much of the region until its defeat by Almoravid invaders in 1052 .
