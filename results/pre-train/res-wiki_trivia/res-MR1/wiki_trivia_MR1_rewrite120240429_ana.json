An incoming light to the human eye that stimulates all its three types of color sensitive cone cells in nearly equal amounts results in white . White is one of the most common colors in nature , the color of sunlight , snow , milk , chalk , limestone and other common minerals . In many cultures white represents or signifies purity , innocence , and light , and is the symbolic opposite of black , or darkness . According to surveys in Europe and the United States , white is the color most often associated with perfection , the good , honesty , cleanliness , the beginning , the new , neutrality , and exactitude .   In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome , priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity , and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity , and a white lamb sacrifice and purity ; the widows of kings dressed in white rather than black as the color of mourning . It sometimes symbolizes royalty ; it was the color of the French kings ( black being the color of the queens ) and of the monarchist movement after the French Revolution as well as of the movement called the White Russians ( not to be confounded with Belarus , literally `` White Russia '' ) who fought the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War ( 1917–1922 ) . Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble , and beginning in the 18th century , with the advent of neoclassical architecture , white became the most common color of new churches , capitols and other government buildings , especially in the United States . It was also widely used in 20th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity , simplicity and strength .   White is an important color for almost all world religions . The Pope , the head of the Roman Catholic Church , has worn white since 1566 , as a symbol of purity and sacrifice . In Islam , and in the Shinto religion of Japan , it is worn by pilgrims ; and by the Brahmins in India . In Western cultures and in Japan , white is the most common color for wedding dresses , symbolizing purity and virginity . In many Asian cultures , white is also the color of mourning .   The white color on television screens and computer monitors is created with the RGB color model by mixing red , green and blue light at equal intensities .

In nature , snow and clouds appear white because they are composed of water droplets or ice crystals mixed with air ; when white sunlight enters snow , very little of the spectrum is absorbed ; almost all of the light is reflected or scattered by the air and water molecules , so the snow appears to be the color of sunlight , white . Beaches with sand containing high amounts of quartz or eroded limestone also appear white , since quartz and limestone reflect or scatter sunlight , rather than absorbing it . Tropical white sand beaches may also have a high quantity of white calcium carbonate from tiny bits of seashells ground to fine sand by the action of the waves .

He was born in Woodland Plantation near La Place , Louisiana .   Biography   Ory started playing music with home-made instruments in his childhood , and by his teens was leading a well-regarded band in Southeast Louisiana . He kept La Place , Louisiana , as his base of operations due to family obligations until his twenty-first birthday , when he moved his band to New Orleans , Louisiana . He was one of the most influential trombonists of early jazz .   Ory was a banjo player during his youth and it is said that his ability to play the banjo helped him develop `` tailgate '' , a particular style of playing the trombone . In `` tailgate '' style the trombone plays a rhythmic line underneath the trumpets and cornets .   While Ory was living on Jackson Avenue , he was discovered by Buddy Bolden , playing his first New trombone , instead of the old civil war trombone . But his sister said he was too young to play with Bolden .   Ory had one of the best-known bands in New Orleans in the 1910s , hiring many of the great jazz musicians of the city , including cornetists Joe `` King '' Oliver , Mutt Carey , and Louis Armstrong , who joined the band in 1919 ; and clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone .   In 1919 he moved to Los Angeles—one of a number of New Orleans musicians to do so near that time—and he recorded there in 1921 with a band that included Mutt Carey , clarinetist and pianist Dink Johnson , and string bassist Ed Garland . Garland and Carey were longtime associates who would still be playing with Ory during his 1940s comeback . While in Los Angeles Ory and his band recorded two instrumentals , `` Ory 's Creole Trombone '' and `` Society Blues '' , as well as a number of songs . They were the first jazz recordings made on the west coast by an African-American jazz band from New Orleans . His band recorded with the recording company Nordskog and Ory paid them for the pressings and then sold them under his own label of `` Kid Ory 's Sunshine Orchestra '' at a store in Los Angeles called Spikes Brothers Music Store . In 1925 , Ory moved to Chicago , where he was very active , working and recording with Louis Armstrong , Jelly Roll Morton , Oliver , Johnny Dodds , Bessie Smith , Ma Rainey , and many others . He mentored Benny Goodman , and later Charles Mingus .   During the Great Depression Ory retired from music and did not play again until 1943 . From 1944 to about 1961 he led one of the top New Orleans style bands of the period . In addition to Mutt Carey and Ed Garland , trumpeters Alvin Alcorn and Teddy Buckner ; clarinetists Darnell Howard , Jimmie Noone , Albert Nicholas , Barney Bigard , and George Probert ; pianists Buster Wilson , Cedric Haywood , and Don Ewell ; and drummer Minor Hall were among his sidemen during this period . All but Probert , Buckner , and Ewell were originally from New Orleans .   The Ory band was an important force in reviving interest in New Orleans jazz , making popular 1940s radio broadcasts—among them a number of slots on The Orson Welles Almanac program ( beginning March 15 , 1944 ) . In 1944–45 the group made a series of recordings on the Crescent Records label , founded by Nesuhi Ertegun for the express purpose of recording Ory 's band .   During the late 1940s and early 1950s , Ory and his group appeared at the Beverly Cavern in Los Angeles .   Ory retired from music in 1966 and spent his last years in Hawaii , with the assistance of Trummy Young . Ory died in Honolulu . He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City , California .

The Tempest   Prospero is the rightful Duke of Milan , whose usurping brother , Antonio , had put him ( with his then three-year old daughter , Miranda ) to sea on `` a rotten carcass of a butt [ boat ] '' to die , 12 years before the play begins . Prospero and Miranda survived and found exile on a small island . He has learned sorcery from books , and uses it while on the island to protect Miranda and control the other characters . Before the play has begun , Prospero frees Ariel from entrapment within `` a cloven pine '' , about which Prospero states :   Prospero 's sorcery is sufficiently powerful to control Ariel and other spirits , as well as to alter weather and even raise the dead : `` Graves at my command have waked their sleepers , oped , and let 'em forth , by my so potent Art . `` - Act V , scene 1 .   On the island , Prospero becomes master of the monster Caliban ( the son of Sycorax , a malevolent witch ) and forces Caliban into submission by punishing him with magic if he does not obey . Ariel is beholden to Prospero after he is freed from his imprisonment inside the pine tree .   At the end of the play , Prospero intends to drown his book and renounce magic . In the view of the audience , this may have been required to make the ending unambiguously happy , as magic was associated with diabolical works ; he will drown his books for the same reason that Doctor Faust , in an earlier play by Christopher Marlowe , promised in vain to burn his books .   Prospero 's speech   The final soliloquy and epilogue in The Tempest is considered to be one of the most memorable speeches in Shakespearean literature .   Now my charms are all o'erthrown ,  And what strength I have 's mine own ,  Which is most faint : now , 't is true ,  I must be here confined by you ,  Or sent to Naples . Let me not ,  Since I have my dukedom got  And pardon 'd the deceiver , dwell  In this bare island by your spell ;  But release me from my bands  With the help of your good hands :  Gentle breath of yours my sails  Must fill , or else my project fails ,  Which was to please . Now I want  Spirits to enforce , art to enchant ,  And my ending is despair ,  Unless I be relieved by prayer ,  Which pierces so that it assaults  Mercy itself and frees all faults .  As you from crimes would pardon 'd be ,  Let your indulgence set me free .   In it , Prospero states his loss ( magic ) and his continuing imprisonment if the audience is not pleased . Many feel that since The Tempest was the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone , Prospero 's feelings echo Shakespeare 's own , or perhaps may even have been his `` retirement speech '' .   Portrayal   * Sir Michael Redgrave played Prospero in a BBC Play of the Month production in 1968 .  * Heathcote Williams played Prospero in Derek Jarman 's 1979 film version of The Tempest .  * Sir Michael Hordern played Prospero in a 1980 production for BBC television .  * A Stratford Shakespeare Festival production was videotaped and broadcast on television in 1983 , starring Len Cariou as Prospero .  * Paul Mazursky 's film , Tempest ( 1983 ) , features a Prospero-esque character portrayed by John Cassavetes who is an exile of his own cynical discontent , ego and self-betrayal and who abandons America for a utopian `` kingdom '' on a secluded Greek isle .  * In Peter Greenaway 's film Prospero 's Books ( 1991 ) , Prospero is played by John Gielgud .  * In Julie Taymor 's 2010 film adaptation of the play , Prospero is played by Helen Mirren and is now named Prospera .  * BBC Radio 3 broadcast a production of The Tempest ( 7 October 2001 ) adapted for radio and directed by David Hunter , starring Philip Madoc as Prospero , Nina Wadia as Ariel , Josh Richards as Caliban , Catrin Rhys as Miranda , Andrew"], [3, "Count Duckula is a British animated comedy-drama dark fantasy television series created by British studio Cosgrove Hall as a spin-off from Danger Mouse , a series in which the Count Duckula character was a recurring villain . Count Duckula premiered for four series from 6 September 1988 to 16 February 1993 , and was produced by Thames Television . In all , 65 episodes were made , each about 22 minutes long . All have been released on DVD in the U.K. , while only the first series has been released in North America .   This show should not be confused with the short lived 1979 Quackula which was produced by Filmation and appeared as part of their Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle cartoon hour .   History   Count Duckula was created by British studio Cosgrove Hall as a spin-off from Danger Mouse . In 1984 Nickelodeon acquired the rights to Danger Mouse which became a hit for the channel . After a few years the Nickelodeon management came to Cosgrove Hall wishing to co-produce a new series . After being shown a number of ideas , the then head of Nickelodeon , Jenny Lebron , spotted a picture of Count Duckula in Brian Cosgrove 's office , and said `` that 's the one I want '' . As the series went into production one of the writers suggested he become a vegetarian , which added an even sillier concept to the series .   Spin-offs   In a move mirroring Duckula 's adaptation from Danger Mouse , the characters of Gaston and Pierre were reinvented and given a spinoff series as the now-human Victor and Hugo .   Count Duckula appeared in North American comics under Star Comics ( an imprint of Marvel Comics ) and introduced an additional difference between this incarnation of Duckula which separated him from his predecessors . Due to ketchup being used in the resurrection ceremony , this version of Duckula has ketchup , rather than blood , flowing through his veins . This was discovered when Duckula was given a blood test in order to get a passport into a fictional country which produced a salad which Duckula was obsessed with getting to eat . In the same issue , Duckula , Nanny , and Igor were photographed as a means of formal ID for said country , however due to the classic stereotype of vampires not appearing in film , Duckula did not appear in the photo which was taken . Duckula would also gain a romantic interest in the Star Comics run ; Vanna Von Goosewing , who turned out to be the niece of his long time adversary Dr . Von Goosewing . The attraction was mutual , and the two continued their relationship though the majority of the series after their introduction , though Vanna did n't always appear in every issue of the book .   Plot   Several episodes explore the theme that each resurrection creates a new incarnation with little to no memory of its past life , the immediate past incarnation referred to as the current 's `` father '' . Thus , every incarnation is free to develop its own personality and pursue its own personal interests . The vampire is able to pose as a `` dreadful dynasty , the counts of Duckula '' . The preceding generations included knights , sorcerers , scientists , artists , Egyptologists and even professional gamblers , all of whom are also secretly `` vicious vampire ducks '' .   However , as the title sequence puts it , `` the latest reincarnation did not run according to plan '' . The successful conclusion of the ritual requires blood ( a send-up of the Hammer Dracula films ) , the source of sustenance for any vampire , but Nanny accidentally substitutes tomato ketchup . Consequently , the newest version is not a blood-sucking vampire , but a vegetarian one . He is more interested in juicy carrots than hunting for victims . Igor is appalled . Even worse , his `` new '' master is obsessed with pursuing wealth and fame as an entertainer .   The stories often centre around Duckula 's adventures in search of riches and fame , assisted by the castle 's ability to teleport around the world . Another regularly occurring theme is the repeated attempt by Igor to turn Duckula into a proper vampire . Some episodes feature Duckula 's nemesis Doctor Von Goosewing ( based on Dr. Abraham Van Helsing , the nemesis of Dracula ) , a vampire hunter who blindly refuses to believe the current incarnation of Duckula is harmless . There is also"], [4, "Coincident full censuses have taken place in the different jurisdictions of the United Kingdom every ten years since 1801 , with the exceptions of 1941 ( during the Second World War ) and both Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State in 1921 . Simultaneous censuses were taken in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man , with the returns being archived with those of England . In addition to providing detailed information about national demographics , the results of the census play an important part in the calculation of resource allocation to regional and local service providers by the governments of both the UK and the European Union . The most recent UK census took place in 2011 .   History   Tax assessments ( known in the later Empire as the indiction ) were made in Britain in Roman times , but detailed records have not survived . In the 7th century AD , Dál Riata ( parts of what is now Scotland and Northern Ireland ) conducted a census , called the `` Tradition of the Men of Alba '' ( Senchus fer n-Alban ) . England conducted its first formal census when the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086 under William I for tax purposes .   Distinct from earlier , less inclusive censuses ( e.g . for religious purposes ) , national decennial censuses of the general population started in 1801 , championed by the statistician John Rickman . The censuses were initially conducted partly to ascertain the number of men able to fight in the Napoleonic Wars , and partly over population concerns stemming from the 1798 work An Essay on the Principle of Population by Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus . Rickman 's twelve reasons – set out in 1798 and repeated in Parliamentary debates – for conducting a census of Great Britain included the following justifications :  * `` the intimate knowledge of any country must form the rational basis of legislation and diplomacy ''  * `` an industrious population is the basic power and resource of any nation , and therefore its size needs to be known ''  * `` the number of men who were required for conscription to the militia in different areas should reflect the area 's population ''  * `` there were defence reasons for wanting to know the number of seamen ''  * `` the need to plan the production of corn and thus to know the number of people who had to be fed ''  * `` a census would indicate the Government 's intention to promote the public good '' , and  * `` the life insurance industry would be stimulated by the results '' .   Regular national censuses have taken place nearly every ten years since 1801 , most recently in 2011 ; other partial censuses have been made on some of the intervening fifth anniversaries . The first four censuses ( 1801–1831 ) were mainly statistical : that is , mainly headcounts , with virtually no personal information . A small number of older records exist in local record offices as by-products of the notes made by enumerators in the production of those earlier censuses ; these might list all persons or just the heads of households . The 1841 Census was the first to intentionally record names of all individuals in a household or institution .   The Census Act of 1920 provides the legal framework for conducting all censuses in Great Britain ( Scotland , England , and Wales ) . The primary legislation for Northern Ireland was introduced in 1969 . Before this legislation , it was necessary to have a separate act of parliament for each census . Britain was also responsible for initiating and co-ordinating censuses in many of its overseas colonies .   Because of the disruption caused by the Second World War , there was no census in 1941 . However , following the passage into law on 5 September 1939 of the National Registration Act 1939 , a population count was carried out on 29 September 1939 . The resulting National Register was later used to develop the NHS Central Register . Censuses were taken on 26 April 1931 in Great Britain , but the returns for England and Wales were destroyed in an accidental fire during the Second World War .   On 24 April 1966 , the UK trialled an alternative method of enumeration – long form/short form . Every household was given a short form to complete , while a sample of the population was given a long form to collect more detailed information . The short form was used for the population count and to"], [5, "The Sixth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor , the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television series Doctor Who . He is portrayed by Colin Baker . Although his televisual time on the series was comparatively brief and turbulent , Baker has continued as the Sixth Doctor in Big Finish 's range of original Doctor Who audio adventures . Within the series ' narrative , the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his TARDIS , frequently with companions . When the Doctor is critically injured , he can regenerate his body ; in doing so , his physical appearance and personality change . Baker portrays the sixth such incarnation , a flamboyant man in brightly coloured , mismatched clothes whose brash and overbearing personality set him apart from all his previous incarnations .   The Sixth Doctor appeared in three seasons . His appearance in the first of these was at the end of the final episode of The Caves of Androzani which featured the regeneration from the Fifth Doctor and thereafter in the following serial The Twin Dilemma , the end of that season . The Sixth Doctor 's era was marked by the decision of the BBC controller Michael Grade to put the series on an 18-month `` hiatus '' between seasons 22 and 23 , with only one new Doctor Who story , Slipback , made on radio during the hiatus , broadcast as 6 parts ( at 10 minutes each ) on BBC Radio 4 from 25 July to 8 August 1985 , as part of a children 's magazine show called Pirate Radio Four . Colin Baker had been signed up for four years , as the previous actor Peter Davison had left after only three years .   Prior to its postponement , season 23 was well advanced with episodes already drafted and in at least one case distributed to cast and production . Alongside `` The Nightmare Fair '' , The Ultimate Evil '' , `` Mission to Magnus '' , `` Yellow Fever and How to Cure It '' , the remaining stories were still under development in a 25-minute episode format after the season was postponed . These were all dropped with the reconception of the season in mid 1985 in favour of a 14 episode story arc called The Trial of a Time Lord . The Sixth Doctor also appeared in the special Dimensions in Time . There are also novels and audio plays featuring the Sixth Doctor , and the character has been visually referenced several times in the revived 2000s production of the show .   Biography   The sixth Doctor 's regeneration was initially unstable , and he nearly strangled Peri before he came to his senses . Realising what he had nearly done , he initially considered going into a hermitlike existence on the planet Titan 3 , only to be caught up in events on the planet Jocanda , after which he resumed his travels ( The Twin Dilemma ) . He encountered many old foes including the Master , Daleks , Cybermen and Sontarans , and even shared an adventure with his own second incarnation in The Two Doctors . He also faced a renegade female Time Lord scientist , the Rani , who was conducting experiments on humans using the Luddite riots as a cover .   Later , the Doctor and Peri landed on the devastated planet Ravolox , which they discovered was actually Earth , moved across space with devastating consequences . Before they could discover the reason for this disaster , the TARDIS landed on Thoros Beta . What actually happened here is unclear , but initial accounts suggest that Peri was killed after being cruelly used as a test subject in brain transplant experiments and the Doctor was pulled out of time to a Time Lord space station where he was put on trial for the second time by his own race , the Time Lords . In reality the trial was a cover-up organised by the High Council . A race from Andromeda had stolen Time Lord secrets and hidden on Earth , so to protect themselves the Time Lords had moved Earth through space , burning the surface in a massive fireball and leaving it as Ravolox . The prosecutor at that trial , the Valeyard , turned out to be a possible future , an evil incarnation of the Doctor himself who was out to steal his remaining lives . He had also edited the Matrix recordings of the Doctor 's travels ; in reality Peri had survived events on Thoros Beta .

He played in 11 first-class matches between 1957 and 1973 , accumulating 226 runs and 12 wickets . He was overshadowed by his brothers Shafqat Rana and Azmat Rana who both represented Pakistan at Test level .   Umpiring career   Rana made his international debut as an umpire in 1974 at Lahore , the city that had become his hometown . The match was between Pakistan and the West Indies . His career continued until his last match between Pakistan and New Zealand in 1996 , also at Lahore . He stood in 18 test matches and 22 One Day Internationals .   Gatting controversy   In a test match in Faisalabad in 1987 , Rana argued furiously with Mike Gatting . The argument stopped the match , and footage of the English cricket captain and the umpire shouting at each other with fingers waved in the other 's face was widely broadcast .   The incident occurred on the second day of the test after Gatting was considered by Rana to have made an alteration to the fielding positions as Eddie Hemmings ran in to bowl - Rana stopped the game and accused Gatting of cheating . Rana had already upset the English by wearing a Pakistan sweater and placing Mudassar Nazar 's cap on his own head . The game was stopped by the incident and only resumed the following day . Rana and Gatting were both accused of using foul language , much of which was heard by a worldwide TV audience via the stump microphone .

Gatting was threatened with being stripped of the England captaincy and was forced into issuing a written apology to Rana . Gatting has since expressed regret at his part in the row .   Coney incident   Gatting was not the only international captain to have had a run-in with Rana . In December 1984 during a Test match in Karachi , New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney threatened to lead his side from the field following a controversial decision of not-out for Pakistan player Javed Miandad .   Legacy   The controversy surrounding Shakoor Rana was a driver in the move towards neutral umpires at Test matches . The home side had previously supplied the umpires but the International Cricket Council have since brought in neutral officials ."], [7, "The Beatles appeared in five motion pictures , most of which were very well received . The exception was the ( mostly unscripted ) television film Magical Mystery Tour which was panned by critics and the public alike . Each of their films had the same name as their associated soundtrack album and a song on that album .   Films starring The Beatles   A Hard Day 's Night   The Beatles had a successful film career , beginning with A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 ) , a loosely scripted comic farce , sometimes compared to the Marx Brothers in style . A black-and-white film , it focused on Beatlemania and the band 's hectic touring lifestyle and was directed by the up-and-coming Richard Lester , who was known for having directed a television version of the successful BBC radio series The Goon Show as well as the off-beat short film The Running , Jumping and Standing Still Film , with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan . A Hard Day 's Night is a mockumentary of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme . The film , released at the height of Beatlemania , was well received by critics , and remains one of the most influential jukebox musicals .   Help !   In 1965 came Help ! ; an Eastmancolour extravaganza , which was also directed by Lester . The film was shot in exotic locations ( such as Salisbury Plain , with Stonehenge visible in the background ; the Bahamas ; Salzburg and the Austrian Alps ) in the style of a Mr. Magoo spoof along with even more Marx Brothers-style zaniness : For example , the film is dedicated `` to Elias Howe , who , in 1846 , invented the sewing machine . '' It was the first Beatles film filmed in colour .   Magical Mystery Tour   The Magical Mystery Tour film was essentially McCartney 's idea , which was thought up as he returned from a trip to the U.S. in the late spring of 1967 , and was loosely inspired by press coverage McCartney had read about Ken Kesey 's Merry Pranksters ' LSD-fuelled American bus odyssey . McCartney felt inspired to take this idea and blend it with the peculiarly English working class tradition of charabanc mystery tours , in which children took chaperoned bus rides through the English countryside , destination unknown . The film was critically dismissed when it was aired on the BBC 's premier television network , BBC-1 , on Boxing Day — a day primarily for traditional `` cosy , family entertainment '' . While the film has historical importance as an early advance into the music video age , at the time many viewers found it plotless and confusing . Compounding this culture clash was the fact that the film was made in colour and made use of colour filters for some of the scenes - particularly in a sequence for `` Blue Jay Way '' - but in December 1967 practically no-one in the UK owned a colour receiver , the service only having started a few months earlier .   Yellow Submarine   The animated Yellow Submarine followed in 1968 , but had little direct input from The Beatles , save for a live-action epilogue and the contribution of five new songs ( including `` Only a Northern Song '' , an unreleased track from the Sgt . Pepper sessions ) . It was acclaimed for its boldly innovative graphic style . The Beatles are said to have been pleased with the result and attended its highly publicised London premiere .   Let It Be   Let It Be was an ill-fated documentary of the band that was shot  over a four-week period in January 1969 . The documentary — which was originally intended to be simply a chronicle of the evolution of an album and the band 's possible return to live  performances — captured the prevailing tensions between the band members , and in this respect it unwittingly became a document of the beginning of their break-up .   The band initially rejected both the film and the album , instead recording and issuing the Abbey Road album . But with so much money having been spent on the project , it was decided to finish , and release , the film and album ( the latter with considerable post-production by Phil Spector ) in the spring of 1970 . When the film finally appeared , it was after the break-up had been announced , which gave the film 's depiction of the band 's acrimony and"], [8, "Dada or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century . Dada in Zürich , Switzerland , began in 1916 at Cabaret Voltaire , spreading to Berlin shortly thereafter , but the height of New York Dada was the year before , in 1915 . The term anti-art , a precursor to Dada , was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 when he created his first readymades . Dada , in addition to being anti-war , had political affinities with the radical left and was also anti-bourgeois .   At least two works qualified as pre-Dadaist , a posteriori , had already sensitized the public and artists alike : Ubu Roi ( 1896 ) by Alfred Jarry , and the ballet Parade ( 1916–17 ) by Erik Satie . The roots of Dada lay in pre-war avant-garde . Cubism and the development of collage , combined with Wassily Kandinsky 's theoretical writings and abstraction , detached the movement from the constraints of reality and convention . The influence of French poets and the writings of German Expressionists liberated Dada from the tight correlation between words and meaning . Avant-garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments . They had seen ( or participated in ) Cubist exhibitions held at Galería Dalmau , Barcelona ( 1912 ) , Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin ( 1912 ) , the Armory show in New York ( 1913 ) , SVU Mánes in Prague ( 1914 ) , several Jack of Diamonds exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring , Amsterdam ( between 1911 and 1915 ) . Futurism developed in response to the work of various artists . Dada subsequently combined these approaches .   Dada activities included public gatherings , demonstrations , and publication of art/literary journals ; passionate coverage of art , politics , and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media . Key figures in the movement included Hugo Ball , Emmy Hennings , Hans Arp , Raoul Hausmann , Hannah Höch , Johannes Baader , Tristan Tzara , Francis Picabia , Richard Huelsenbeck , George Grosz , John Heartfield , Marcel Duchamp , Beatrice Wood , Kurt Schwitters , Hans Richter , and Max Ernst , among others . The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements , and groups including surrealism , Nouveau Réalisme , pop art and Fluxus .   Overview   Dada was an informal international movement , with participants in Europe and North America . The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I . For many participants , the movement was a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests , which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war , and against the cultural and intellectual conformity—in art and more broadly in society—that corresponded to the war .   Many Dadaists believed that the 'reason ' and 'logic ' of bourgeois capitalist society had led people into war . They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace chaos and irrationality . For example , George Grosz later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest `` against this world of mutual destruction . ''   According to Hans Richter Dada was not art : it was `` anti-art . '' Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for . Where art was concerned with traditional aesthetics , Dada ignored aesthetics . If art was to appeal to sensibilities , Dada was intended to offend .   As Hugo Ball expressed it , `` For us , art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in . ''   A reviewer from the American Art News stated at the time that `` Dada philosophy is the sickest , most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man . '' Art historians have described Dada as being , in large part , a `` reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide . ''   Years later , Dada artists described the movement as `` a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis , a savior , a monster , which would lay waste to everything in its path ... [ It was ] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization ... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege .

He co-founded Apple Computer ( now Apple Inc. ) with Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs , providing administrative oversight for the new venture . He soon , however , sold his share of the new company for $ 800 US dollars , and later accepted $ 1,500 to forfeit any claims against Apple ( in total , ) .   Early life   Wayne was born in Cleveland , Ohio , United States on May 17 , 1934 . He trained as a technical draftsman at the School of Industrial Arts in New York . In 1956 he moved to California . Wayne 's first business venture was a company selling slot machines . The company failed , with Wayne reflecting in 2014 that , `` I discovered very quickly that I had no business being in business . I was far better working in engineering . ''   Career   Apple   Wayne worked with Steve Jobs at Atari before he , Jobs , and Wozniak founded Apple Computer on April 1 , 1976 . Serving as the venture 's `` adult supervision '' , Wayne drew the first Apple logo , wrote the three men 's original partnership agreement , and wrote the Apple I manual .   Wayne received a 10 % stake in Apple but relinquished his equity for US $ 800 less than two weeks later , on April 12 , 1976 . Legally , all members of a partnership are personally responsible for any debts incurred by any partner ; unlike Jobs and Wozniak , then 21 and 25 , Wayne had personal assets that potential creditors could seize . The failure of a slot machine company that he had started five years earlier also contributed to his decision to exit the partnership .   Later that year , venture capitalist Arthur Rock and Mike Markkula helped develop a business plan and converted the partnership to a corporation . A year after leaving Apple , Wayne received $ 1,500 for his agreement to forfeit any claims against the new company . In its first year of operations ( 1976 ) , Apple 's sales reached US $ 174,000 . In 1977 sales rose to US $ 2.7 million , in 1978 to US $ 7.8 million , and in 1980 to US $ 117 million . By 1982 Apple had a billion dollars in annual sales . In February 2015 , Apple 's value exceeded $ 700 billion , making it the most valuable U.S. company by far . Had Wayne kept his 10 % stock until then , it would have been worth billions .   Wayne has stated that he does not regret selling his share of the company as he made the `` best decision with the information available to me at the time '' . Wayne also stated that he felt the Apple enterprise `` would be successful , but at the same time there would be significant bumps along the way and I could n't risk it . I had already had a rather unfortunate business experience before . I was getting too old and those two were whirlwinds . It was like having a tiger by the tail and I could n't keep up with these guys . ''   Post-Apple   After leaving Apple , Wayne resisted Jobs ' attempts to get him to return , remaining at Atari until 1978 , when he joined Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and later an electronics company in Salinas , California .   Wayne retired to a Pahrump , Nevada mobile home park selling stamps and rare coins in Pahrump . Wayne never owned an Apple product until 2011 , when he was given an iPad 2 by Aral Balkan at the Update Conference in Brighton , England .   Wayne also ran a stamp shop in Milpitas , California for a short time in the late 1970s , Wayne 's Philatelics . After a number of break-ins , he moved his stamp operations to Nevada . The logo for the business was a wood-cut style design , with a man sitting under an apple tree , with the `` Wayne 's Philatelics '' name written in a flowing ribbon curved around the tree . This was the original logo he designed for Apple Computer .   In the early 1990s Wayne sold the original Apple company agreement , signed in 1976 by Jobs , Wozniak and himself , for $ 500 . In 2011 the contract was sold at auction for $ 1.6 million . Wayne has stated"], [10, "Romanesque architecture is an architectural style of medieval Europe characterized by semi-circular arches . There is no consensus for the beginning date of the Romanesque style , with proposals ranging from the 6th to the late 10th century , this later date being the most commonly held . It developed in the 12th century into the Gothic style , marked by pointed arches . Examples of Romanesque architecture can be found across the continent , making it the first pan-European architectural style since Imperial Roman Architecture . The Romanesque style in England is traditionally referred to as Norman architecture .   Combining features of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings and other local traditions , Romanesque architecture is known by its massive quality , thick walls , round arches , sturdy pillars , groin vaults , large towers and decorative arcading . Each building has clearly defined forms , frequently of very regular , symmetrical plan ; the overall appearance is one of simplicity when compared with the Gothic buildings that were to follow . The style can be identified right across Europe , despite regional characteristics and different materials .   Many castles were built during this period , but they are greatly outnumbered by churches . The most significant are the great abbey churches , many of which are still standing , more or less complete and frequently in use.Bannister Fletcher , A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method . The enormous quantity of churches built in the Romanesque period was succeeded by the still busier period of Gothic architecture , which partly or entirely rebuilt most Romanesque churches in prosperous areas like England and Portugal . The largest groups of Romanesque survivors are in areas that were less prosperous in subsequent periods , including parts of southern France , northern Spain and rural Italy . Survivals of unfortified Romanesque secular houses and palaces , and the domestic quarters of monasteries are far rarer , but these used and adapted the features found in church buildings , on a domestic scale .   Definition   According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word `` Romanesque '' means `` descended from Roman '' and was first used in English to designate what are now called Romance languages ( first cited 1715 ) . The French term `` '' was first used in the architectural sense by archaeologist Charles de Gerville in a letter of 18 December 1818 to Auguste Le Prévost to describe what Gerville sees as a debased Roman architecture . In 1824 Gerville 's friend Arcisse de Caumont adopted the label `` '' to describe the `` degraded '' European architecture from the 5th to the 13th centuries , in his Essai sur l'architecture religieuse du moyen-âge , particulièrement en Normandie , at a time when the actual dates of many of the buildings so described had not been ascertained : Jean Hubert , Romanesque Art .   The first use in a published work is in William Gunn 's An Inquiry into the Origin and Influence of Gothic Architecture ( London 1819 ) . The word was used by Gunn to describe the style that was identifiably Medieval and prefigured the Gothic , yet maintained the rounded Roman arch and thus appeared to be a continuation of the Roman tradition of building .   The term is now used for the more restricted period from the late 10th to 12th centuries . The term `` Pre-romanesque '' is sometimes applied to architecture in Germany of the Carolingian and Ottonian periods and Visigothic , Mozarab and Asturian constructions between the 8th and the 10th centuries in the Iberian Peninsula while `` First Romanesque '' is applied to buildings in north of Italy and Spain and parts of France that have Romanesque features but pre-date the influence of the Abbey of Cluny .

He was born in Stanmore , New South Wales and won a scholarship to study law at the University of Melbourne . Holt went into business as a solicitor , during which time he joined the United Australia Party ( UAP ) . In 1935 , aged just 27 , he was elected for Fawkner . Holt spent 32 years in Parliament , including many years as a senior Cabinet Minister , but was Prime Minister for only 22 months before he disappeared in December 1967 while swimming at Cheviot Beach near Portsea , Victoria , and was presumed drowned .   As Minister for Immigration ( 1949–1956 ) , Holt was responsible for the relaxation of the White Australia policy and as Treasurer under Menzies , he initiated major fiscal reforms including the establishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia , and launched and guided the process to convert Australia to decimal currency . As Prime Minister , he oversaw landmark changes including the decision not to devalue the Australian dollar in line with the British pound , and the 1967 constitutional referendum in which an overwhelming majority of Australians voted in favour of giving the Commonwealth power to legislate specifically for indigenous Australians . He controversially expanded Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War , with the slogan `` All the way with LBJ '' .   Early life   Born in Stanmore , New South Wales on 5 August 1908 , Holt was the elder son of Thomas and Olive ( née Williams ) . He and his brother Cliff ( Clifford Thomas Holt , born 1910 ) , spent their early life in Sydney , attending three different schools . In 1918 , Thomas Holt divorced Olive and went to work with the Hugh D. McIntosh , manager of the Tivoli theatre circuit . He later became the Tivoli-J C Williamson representative in London and New York . Meanwhile , he enrolled his sons as boarders at Wesley College in Melbourne .   In 1924 , when Holt was sixteen , his mother died and he did not attend her funeral . A formative event was his singing performance at his school 's annual Speech Night in December 1926 . None of his family were present , and he never forgot the loneliness he felt that night .   Holt won a scholarship to Queen 's College at the University of Melbourne and began his law degree in 1927 . He excelled in many areas of university life – he won College 'Blues ' for cricket and Australian rules football , as well as the College Oratory and Essay Prize . A member of the Melbourne Inter-University Debating team and the United Australia Organization ' A ' Grade debating team , he was president of both the Sports and Social Club and the Law Students ' Society .   Holt graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1930 . He was admitted to the Victorian Bar in November 1932 and served his articles with the Melbourne firm of Fink , Best & Miller , but the Great Depression meant that he was unable to find work as a barrister . His father , based in London at the time , wanted him to further his studies in England , but the worsening economy also made this impossible . Instead , in 1933 , Holt went into sole practice as a solicitor . He later entered into a partnership , which became the firm of Holt , Graham & Newman , which Holt remained with until 1963 .   While at university , Holt had met Zara Kate Dickins . In 1934 they were contemplating marriage , but , after a quarrel , they split up . Zara travelled overseas , meeting Captain James Fell , a British Army officer stationed in India , whom she married in March 1935 . Her first son Nicholas was born in 1937 , followed by twin boys Sam and Andrew , born in 1939 . Author Tom Frame has suggested that Holt was the father of the twins . Zara and Fell subsequently divorced , and she married Holt in 1946 . Although they remained married until Holt 's death in 1967 , Zara later commented that Holt had had a number of extramarital affairs .   Meanwhile , Thomas Holt married Lola Thring , the daughter of his business partner F. W. Thring , in 1936 . He died in 1945 .

It is the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement within the borders of the contiguous United States .   The county seat of St. Johns County , it is part of Florida 's First Coast region and the Jacksonville metropolitan area . According to the 2010 census , the city population was 12,975 . The United States Census Bureau 's 2013 estimate of the city 's population was 13,679 , while the urban area had a population of 69,173 in 2012 .   Saint Augustine was founded on September 8 , 1565 , by Spanish admiral and Florida 's first governor , Pedro Menéndez de Avilés . He named the settlement `` San Agustín '' , as his ships bearing settlers , troops , and supplies from Spain had first sighted land in Florida on August 28 , 1565 , the feast day of St. Augustine . The city served as the capital of Spanish Florida for over 200 years , and became the capital of British East Florida when the territory briefly changed hands between Spain and Britain . Spain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819 , and when the treaty was ratified in 1821 , St. Augustine was designated the capital of the Florida Territory until Tallahassee was made the capital in 1824 . Since the late 19th century , St. Augustine 's distinct historical character has made the city a major tourist attraction . It is also the headquarters for the Florida National Guard .   History   Founding by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés   Founded in 1565 by the Spanish conquistador , Pedro Menéndez de Avilés , St. Augustine is the oldest continuously occupied settlement of European origin in the United States . In 1562 , a group of French Protestants known as Huguenots , led by Jean Ribault , arrived in Spanish Florida to establish a colony in the territory claimed by Spain . They explored the mouth of the St. Johns River , calling it la Rivière de Mai ( the River May ) , then sailed northward and established a settlement called Charlesfort at Port Royal Sound in present-day South Carolina . Spain learned of this French expedition through its spies at ports on the Atlantic coast of France . The Huguenot nobleman René de Laudonnière , who had participated in the expedition , returned to Florida in 1564 with three ships and 300 Huguenot colonists . He arrived at the mouth of the River May on June 22 , 1564 , sailed up it a few miles , and founded Fort Caroline .   Desiring to protect its claimed territories in North America against such incursions , the Spanish Crown issued an asiento to Menéndez , signed by King Philip II on March 20 , 1565 , granting him expansive trade privileges , the power to distribute lands , licenses to sell 500 slaves , as well as various titles , including that of adelantado of Florida . This contract directed Menéndez to sail for La Florida , reconnoitre it from the Florida Keys to present-day Canada , and report on its coastal features , with a view to establishing a permanent colony for the defense of the Spanish treasure fleet . He was ordered as well to drive away any intruders who were not subjects of the Spanish crown .   On July 28 , Menéndez set sail from Cádiz with a fleet led by his 600-ton flagship , the San Pelayo , accompanied by several smaller ships , and carrying over 1,000 sailors , soldiers , and settlers . On the feast day of St. Augustine , August 28 , the fleet sighted land and anchored off the north inlet of the tidal channel the French called the River of Dolphins . Menéndez then sailed north and confronted Ribault 's fleet outside the bar of the River May in a brief skirmish . On September 6 , he returned to the site of his first landfall , naming it after the Catholic saint , disembarked his troops , and quickly constructed fortifications to protect his people and supplies .   Menéndez then marched his soldiers overland for a surprise attack on Fort Caroline , where they killed almost everyone in the fort except for the women and children . Jean Ribault had already put out to sea with his ships for an assault on St. Augustine , but was surprised by a storm that wrecked his ships further south . Informed by his Indian allies that the survivors were walking northward on the coast , Menéndez began to search for the Frenchmen , who had made it as far as"], [13, "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a cricket field , at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a wicket , a set of three wooden stumps sited at each end . One team , designated the batting team , attempts to score as many runs as possible , whilst their opponents field . Each phase of play is called an innings . After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a set number of overs have been completed , the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles . The winning team is the one that scores the most runs , including any extras gained , during their period batting .   At the start of each game , two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play . The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team , known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , towards a set of wooden stumps , in front of which stands one of the batsmen , known as the striker . The striker 's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat , and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs . The other batsman , known as the non-striker , waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler . The bowler 's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman , at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease .   The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball , leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat , and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground . Runs are scored through two main methods : either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary , or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball . If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground , a run-out occurs . Adjudication is performed on-field by two umpires .   The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) and Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs , to Test cricket , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece . Traditionally , cricketers play in all-white kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard , solid object made of compressed leather enclosing a cork core .   Although cricket 's origins are uncertain , it is first recorded in south-east England in the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the mid-19th century . ICC , the game 's governing body , has over 100 members , ten of which are full members who play Test cricket . Women 's cricket , which is organised and played separately , has also achieved international standard . Cricket is the world 's second most popular spectator sport , after association football , and is followed primarily in Australasia , Great Britain and Ireland , the Indian subcontinent , southern Africa and the West Indies .   Etymology   A number of words have been suggested as sources for the term `` cricket '' . In the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598 it is called creckett . One possible source for the name is the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.Birley , p. 3 . In Samuel Johnson 's Dictionary , he derived cricket from `` cryce , Saxon , a stick '' . In Old French , the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick . Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy , the name may have"], [14, "Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. is an Italian company that designs and manufactures motorcycles . Headquartered in Bologna , Italy , Ducati is owned by German automotive manufacturer Audi through its Italian subsidiary Lamborghini , which is all owned by the Volkswagen Group .   History   In 1926 Antonio Cavalieri Ducati and his three sons , Adriano , Marcello , and Bruno Cavalieri Ducati ; founded Società Scientifica Radio Brevetti Ducati in Bologna to produce vacuum tubes , condensers and other radio components . In 1935 they had become successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city . Production was maintained during World War II , despite the Ducati factory being a repeated target of Allied bombing .   Meanwhile , at the small Turinese firm SIATA ( Societa Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto-Aviatorie ) , Aldo Farinelli began developing a small pushrod engine for mounting on bicycles . Barely a month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944 , SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine , called the `` Cucciolo '' ( Italian for `` puppy , '' in reference to the distinctive exhaust sound ) to the public . The first Cucciolos were available alone , to be mounted on standard bicycles , by the buyer ; however , businessmen soon bought the little engines in quantity , and offered complete motorized-bicycle units for sale .   In 1950 , after more than 200,000 Cucciolos had been sold , in collaboration with SIATA , the Ducati firm finally offered its own Cucciolo-based motorcycle . This first Ducati motorcycle was a 48 cc bike weighing , with a top speed of , and had a 15 mm giving just under . Ducati soon dropped the Cucciolo name in favor of `` 55M '' and `` 65TL '' .   When the market moved toward larger motorcycles , Ducati management decided to respond , making an impression at an early-1952 Milan show , introducing their 65TS cycle and Cruiser ( a four-stroke motor scooter ) . Despite being described as the most interesting new machine at the 1952 show , the Cruiser was not a great success , and only a few thousand were made over a two-year period before the model ceased production .   In 1953 , management split the company into two separate entities , Ducati Meccanica SpA and Ducati Elettronica , in acknowledgment of its diverging motorcycle and electronics product lines . Ducati Elettronica became Ducati Energia SpA in the eighties . Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance . By 1954 , Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day .   In the 1960s , Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250 cc road bike then available , the Mach 1 . In the 1970s Ducati began producing large-displacement V-twin motorcycles and in 1973 , released a V-twin with the trademarked desmodromic valve design . In 1985 , Cagiva bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the `` Cagiva '' name . By the time the purchase was completed , Cagiva kept the `` Ducati '' name on its motorcycles . Eleven years later , in 1996 , Cagiva accepted the offer from Texas Pacific Group and sold a 51 % stake in the company for US $ 325 million ; then , in 1998 , Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49 % to become the sole owner of Ducati . In 1999 , TPG issued an initial public offering of Ducati stock and renamed the company `` Ducati Motor Holding SpA '' . TPG sold over 65 % of its shares in Ducati , leaving TPG the majority shareholder . In December 2005 , Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific 's stake ( minus one share ) to Investindustrial Holdings , the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi .   In April 2012 , Volkswagen Group 's Audi subsidiary announced its intention to buy Ducati for € ( US $ ) . Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piëch , a motorcycle enthusiast , had long coveted Ducati , and had regretted that he passed up an opportunity to buy the company from the Italian government in 1984 . Analysts doubted a tiny motorcycle maker would have a meaningful effect on a company the size of Volkswagen , commenting that the acquisition has `` a trophy feel to it , '' and , `` is driven by VW 's passion for nameplates rather than industrial or financial logic '' .

Publications such as EG use it to classify endgame types and to index endgame studies .   The code is named after Richard Guy , Hugh Blandford and John Roycroft . The first two devised the original system ( the Guy–Blandford code ) using different figures to represent the number of pieces . Roycroft suggested to count one for a white piece and three for a black piece in order to make the code easier to memorise .   Definition   In the GBR code , every chess position is represented by six digits , in the following format :   abcd.ef   * a = queens  * b = rooks  * c = bishops  * d = knights  * e = white pawns  * f = black pawns   For the first four digits , each white piece counts as 1 , and each black piece counts as 3 . Thus , for example , if White has two knights and Black has one knight , numeral d 1 + 1 + 3  5 . If that is all the material other than the kings , the position is classified 0005 . Values 0 through 8 represent all normal permutations of force ; 9 is used if either side has promoted material .   The last two digits of the code represent the number of white and black pawns , respectively .   Usage   GBR code can be used to refer to a general class of material . For example , the endgame of two knights against pawn ( as famously analysed by A.A. Troitsky , leading to his discovery of the Troitsky line ) , is GBR class 0002.01 .   When indexing or referring to specific positions , rather than generalised material imbalances , the code may be extended in various ways . Two common ones are to prefix `` + '' to indicate the stipulation `` White to play and win '' or `` '' for `` White to play and draw '' ; and to suffix the position of the white and black kings . With these additions , the position to the right , a draw study by Leonid Kubbel ( First Prize , Shakhmaty , 1925 ) , is classified as  0323.12g3g1 . ( The solution is : 1.Bf2+ Kh1 2.h7 c2+ 3.Be3 Rxe3+ 4.Kf2 Rh3 5.Bd5+ cxd5 6.hxg8Q Rh2+ 7.Kf3 c1  Q 8.Qg2+ Rxg2 . ) The positions of other pieces can also be added ; this produces a notation that provides the same information as Forsyth–Edwards Notation .

The book tells the story of a Chinese boy with a long name who fell into a well . It is a sort of origin myth about why Chinese names are so short today . The book is controversial because it appears to retell a Japanese story and because it does not portray Chinese culture accurately .   Plot   Tikki Tikki Tembo is set in ancient China and invents an ancient Chinese custom whereby parents honor their first-born sons with long , elaborate names that everyone is obliged to say completely - no nicknames , no shortening of any kind - while second-born sons are typically given short , unimportant names . A boy named Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo ( `` The Most Wonderful Thing in the Whole Wide World '' ) and his little brother Chang ( `` Little or Nothing '' ) are playing very close to a well at their house that their mother has warned them to avoid . Chang falls in the well and his older brother runs to their mother and tells her Chang has fallen down the well . Their mother tells him to get the Old Man with the Ladder . He goes and tells the old man . Chang is rescued and then recovers quickly . Some time later , the boys are again playing near the well . This time , the older brother falls in . Chang runs to their mother and tries to tell her that `` Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo has fallen into the well . '' At first she can not hear him so he says it again . However , because Chang is out of breath from running he sputters and then mispronounces the name . His mother insists that he repeat the namebut with respect . He tries repeatedly until finally his mother tells Chang to get the Old Man with the Ladder . Chang goes to the Old Man with the Ladder . Initially , the old man does not respond because he is asleep . Further , when Chang tries to wake him up , the Old Man with the Ladderannoyedtries to fall back asleep . After Chang breathlessly repeats his brother 's predicament the Old Man goes with Chang to save his brother from the well . They get Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo-chari Bari Ruchi-pip Peri Pembo from the well , but because of the long time he was in the well , it was many moons before he was quite the same again . The end of the story says that this is why the Chinese have short names .   Reception   The book received accolades upon publication . The Kirkus Review found the illustrations to be `` a skillful counterpoint of diminutive detail and spacious landscape and a fine setting for a sprightly folktale . '' The book won a 1968 Boston Globe–Horn Book Award in the Picture Book category .   In 1997 , The New York Times selected it as one of the 50 best children 's books of the previous 50 years . In a 1999-2000 National Education Association online survey of children , the book was one of the `` Kids ' Top 100 Books '' . Based on a 2007 online poll , the National Education Association named the book one of its `` Teachers ' Top 100 Books for Children '' . In a 2008 online poll of `` Top 100 Picture Books '' by School Library Journal , the book ranked 35th ; in a similar 2012 poll , the book ranked 89th . According to the publisher , over one million copies of the book had been sold by 2013 .   The 2009 audio book version of the story received a Parents ' Choice Foundation rating of `` Approved '' .   Background   The publisher states that the author `` first heard the story ... as a child '' and that the book is `` her own retelling '' of it . However , the story is thought to have come from Japan rather than from China . Specifically , it has been suggested that the story originated from the very similar Japanese rakugo about Jugemu Jugemu Gokō-no surikire Kaijarisuigyo-no Suigyōmatsu Unraimatsu Fūraimatsu Kūnerutokoro-ni Sumutokoro Yaburakōji-no burakōji Paipopaipo Paipo-no-shūringan Shūringan-no Gūrindai Gūrindai-no Ponpokopī-no Ponpokonā-no Chōkyūmei-no Chōsuke .

Invented in about 1700 ( the exact date is uncertain ) , the piano is widely employed in classical , jazz , traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances , accompaniment , and for composing and rehearsal . Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones . With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed . The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced .   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments . The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe . During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings . By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key . Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case , soundboard , bridge , and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings .   Invention   The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori ( 1655–1731 ) of Padua , Italy , who was employed by Ferdinando de ' Medici , Grand Prince of Tuscany , as the Keeper of the Instruments ; he was an expert harpsichord maker , and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments .

When it first launched the internal conflict in Peru in 1980 , its stated goal was to replace what it saw as bourgeois democracy with `` New Democracy '' . The Shining Path believed that by establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat , inducing cultural revolution , and eventually sparking world revolution , they could arrive at pure communism . Their representatives said that existing socialist countries were revisionist , and they claimed to be the vanguard of the world communist movement . The Shining Path 's ideology and tactics have been influential among other Maoist insurgent groups , notably the Communist Party of Nepal ( Maoist ) and other Revolutionary Internationalist Movement-affiliated organizations .   Widely condemned for its brutality , [ http : //www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067404/ `` Shining-Path '' ] , Encyclopædia Britannica . Retrieved June 11 , 2009 including violence deployed against peasants , trade union organizers , popularly elected officials and the general civilian population , the Shining Path is classified by the Peruvian government , the U.S. , the European Union , and Canada as a terrorist organization .   Since the capture of its leader Abimael Guzmán in 1992 , the Shining Path has declined in activity . Similar to militant groups in Colombia , some factions of the Shining Path have functioned as a highly efficient cocaine-smuggling operation , with an ostensibly paternalistic relationship to villagers.Simon Romero , [ http : //www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/world/americas/18peru.html ? _r  1 `` Cocaine Trade Helps Rebels Reignite War in Peru '' ] , The New York Times , March 17 , 2009   Name   The common name of this group , Shining Path , distinguishes it from several other Peruvian communist parties with similar names ( see Communism in Peru ) . The name is derived from a maxim of José Carlos Mariátegui , founder of the original Peruvian Communist Party in the 1920s : `` El Marxismo-Leninismo abrirá el sendero luminoso hacia la revolución '' ( `` Marxism–Leninism will open the shining path to revolution '' ) .   This maxim was featured in the masthead of the newspaper of a Shining Path front group . Peruvian communist groups are often distinguished by the names of their publications . The followers of this group are generally called senderistas . All documents , periodicals and other materials produced by the organization are signed by the Communist Party of Peru ( PCP ) . Academics often refer to them as PCP-SL .   Origins   The Shining Path was founded in the late 1960s by Abimael Guzmán , a former university philosophy professor ( referred to by his followers by his nom de guerre Presidente Gonzalo ) . His teachings created the foundation of its militant Maoist doctrine . It was an offshoot of the Communist Party of Peru — Bandera Roja ( red flag ) , which in turn split from the original Peruvian Communist Party , a derivation of the Peruvian Socialist Party founded by José Carlos Mariátegui in 1928 .   The Shining Path first established a foothold at San Cristóbal of Huamanga University , in Ayacucho , where Guzmán taught philosophy . The university had recently reopened after being closed for about half a century , and many students of the newly educated class adopted the Shining Path 's radical ideology . Between 1973 and 1975 , Shining Path members gained control of the student councils in the Universities of Huancayo and La Cantuta , and developed a significant presence in the National University of Engineering in Lima and the National University of San Marcos . Sometime later , it lost many student elections in the universities , including Guzmán 's San Cristóbal of Huamanga . It decided to abandon recruiting at the universities and reconsolidate .   Beginning on March 17 , 1980 , the Shining Path held a series of clandestine meetings in Ayacucho , known as the Central Committee 's second plenary . It formed a `` Revolutionary Directorate '' that was political and military in nature and ordered its militias to transfer to strategic areas in the provinces to start the `` armed struggle '' , despite the revisionism instituted in China by Deng Xiaoping and its economic success since 1978 . The group also held its `` First Military School '' where members were instructed in military tactics and in the use of weapons . They also engaged in `` Criticism and Self-criticism '' , a Maoist practice intended to purge bad habits and to avoid the repetition of"], [19, "The Copa Libertadores de América ( ) is an annual international club football competition organized by CONMEBOL since 1960 . It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in Latin American football . The tournament is named in honor of the Libertadores ( Spanish and Portuguese for liberators ) , the main leaders of the South American wars of independence , so a literal translation of its name into English would be `` Liberators of America Cup '' .   The tournament is currently sponsored by Bridgestone and is thus known as the Copa Bridgestone Libertadores . The competition has had several different formats over its lifetime . At the beginning , only the champions of the South American leagues participated . In 1966 , the runners-up of the South American leagues began to join . In 1998 , Mexican teams were invited to compete , and have contested regularly since 2000 , when the tournament was expanded from 20 to 32 teams . Today at least three clubs per country compete in the tournament , while Argentina and Brazil each have five clubs participating . Traditionally , a group stage has always been used but the number of teams per group has varied several times .   In the present format , the tournament consists of six stages , with the first stage taking place in early February . The six surviving teams from the first stage join 26 teams in the second stage , in which there are eight groups consisting of four teams each . The eight group winners and eight runners-up enter the final four stages , better known as the knockout stages , which ends with the finals anywhere between June and August . The winner of the Copa Libertadores becomes eligible to play in the FIFA Club World Cup and the Recopa Sudamericana .   Independiente of Argentina are the most successful club in the cup 's history , having won the tournament seven times . Argentine clubs have accumulated the most victories with 23 wins , while Brazil has the largest number of different winning teams , with a total of 10 clubs having won the title . The cup has been won by 24 different clubs , 13 of which have won the title more than once , and won consecutively by six clubs . The defending champions were Argentine side River Plate , who won their third title after beating Tigres UANL of Mexico .   History   The clashes for the Copa Río de La Plata between the champions of Argentina and Uruguay kindled the idea of a continental competition in the 1930s . In 1948 , the South American Championship of Champions ( ) , the most direct precursor to the Copa Libertadores , was played and organized by Chilean club Colo-Colo after years of planning and organization . Held in Santiago , it brought together the champions of each nation 's top national leagues . The tournament was won by Vasco da Gama of Brazil .   In 1958 , the basis and format of the competition was created by Peñarol 's board leaders . On March 5 , 1959 , at the 24th South American Congress held in Buenos Aires , the competition was approved by the International Affairs Committee . In 1966 , it was named in honor of the heroes of South American liberation , such as José Gervasio Artigas , Bernardo O'Higgins , José de San Martín , Pedro I , and Simón Bolívar , among others .   Beginnings : 1960–1969   The first edition of the Copa Libertadores took place in 1960 . Seven teams participated : Bahia of Brazil , Jorge Wilstermann of Bolivia , Millonarios of Colombia , Olimpia of Paraguay , Peñarol of Uruguay , San Lorenzo of Argentina and Universidad de Chile . All these teams were domestic champions of their respective leagues in 1959 . The first Copa Libertadores match took place on April 19 , 1960 . It was won by Peñarol , who defeated Jorge Wilstermann 7–1 . The first goal in Copa Libertadores history was scored by Carlos Borges of Peñarol . The Uruguayans won the first ever edition , defeating Olimpia in the finals , and successfully defended the title in 1961 . The Copa Libertadores did not receive international attention until its third edition , when the sublime football of a Santos team led by Pelé , considered by some the best club team of all time , earned worldwide admiration . Os Santásticos , also known as O Balé Branco ( the white ballet ) won the title in 1962 defeating defending champions Peñarol"], [20, "Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound with the formula . In its pure form , it is a colourless liquid , slightly more viscous than water ; however , for safety reasons it is normally used as a solution . Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest peroxide ( a compound with an oxygen–oxygen single bond ) and finds use as a weak oxidizer , bleaching agent and disinfectant . Concentrated hydrogen peroxide , or `` high-test peroxide '' , is a reactive oxygen species and has been used as a propellant in rocketry .   Hydrogen peroxide is often described as being `` water but with one more oxygen atom '' , a description that can give the incorrect impression of significant chemical similarity between the two compounds . While they have a similar melting point and appearance , pure hydrogen peroxide will explode if heated to boiling , will cause serious contact burns to the skin and can set materials alight on contact . For these reasons it is usually handled as a dilute solution ( household grades are typically 3–6 % in the U.S. and somewhat higher in Europe ) . Its chemistry is dominated by the nature of its unstable peroxide bond .   Structure and properties   Properties   The boiling point of has been extrapolated as being 150.2 °C , approximately 50 °C higher than water . In practice hydrogen peroxide will undergo potentially explosive thermal decomposition if heated to this temperature . It may be safely distilled at lower temperatures under reduced pressure .   Aqueous solutions   In aqueous solutions hydrogen peroxide differs from the pure material due to the effects of hydrogen bonding between water and hydrogen peroxide molecules . Hydrogen peroxide and water form a eutectic mixture , exhibiting freezing-point depression ; pure water has a melting point of 0 °C and pure hydrogen peroxide of −0.43 °C , but a 50 % ( by volume ) solution of the two freezes at −51 °C . The boiling point of the same mixtures is also depressed in relation with the mean of both boiling points ( 125.1 °C ) . It occurs at 114 °C . This boiling point is 14 °C greater than that of pure water and 36.2 °C less than that of pure hydrogen peroxide .   Structure   Hydrogen peroxide ( ) is a nonplanar molecule with ( twisted ) C2 symmetry . Although the O−O bond is a single bond , the molecule has a relatively high rotational barrier of 2460 cm−1 ( 29.45 kJ/mol ) ; for comparison , the rotational barrier for ethane is 12.5 kJ/mol . The increased barrier is ascribed to repulsion between the lone pairs of the adjacent oxygen atoms and results in hydrogen peroxide displaying atropisomerism .   The molecular structures of gaseous and crystalline are significantly different . This difference is attributed to the effects of hydrogen bonding , which is absent in the gaseous state . Crystals of are tetragonal with the space group D'P4121 .   Comparison with analogues   Hydrogen peroxide has several structural analogues with Hm−X−X−Hn bonding arrangements ( water also shown for comparison ) . It has the highest ( theoretical ) boiling point of this series ( X = O , N , S ) . Its melting point is also fairly high , being comparable to that of hydrazine and water , with only hydroxylamine crystallising significantly more readily , indicative of particularly strong hydrogen bonding . Diphosphane and hydrogen disulfide exhibit only weak hydrogen bonding and have little chemical similarity to hydrogen peroxide . All of these analogues are thermodynamically unstable . Structurally , the analogues all adopt similar skewed structures , due to repulsion between adjacent lone pairs .   Discovery   Hydrogen peroxide was first described in 1818 by Louis Jacques Thénard , who produced it by treating barium peroxide with nitric acid . An improved version of this process used hydrochloric acid , followed by addition of sulfuric acid to precipitate the barium sulfate byproduct . Thénard 's process was used from the end of the 19th century until the middle of the 20th century .   Pure hydrogen peroxide was long believed to be unstable , as early attempts to separate it from the water , which is present during synthesis , all failed . This instability was due to traces of impurities ( transition-metal salts ) , which catalyze the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide . Pure hydrogen peroxide was first obtained in 1894 — almost 80 years after its discovery — by Richard Wolffenstein , who produced it by vacuum distillation .   Determination of the molecular structure of hydrogen peroxide"], [21, "The second city of the United Kingdom is an unofficial claim made at various times by several cities since the establishment of the UK in 1801 . Commonly a country 's second city is the city that is thought to be the second most important , usually after the capital or first city according to criteria such as population size , economic importance and cultural contribution .   Historically several cities have been considered the `` second city of the British Empire '' , both Glasgow and Liverpool were burgeoning major industrial cities throughout the 19th century with competing claims to be the busiest ports in the world for ship building and freight transport , Calcutta also laid the claim from as far away as India as the most populous city while in 1911 the editor of the Irish Times laid a claim for Dublin during a ceremonial visit by George V. Since the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1949 several cities have made claims to be the `` second city of the Commonwealth '' ( often with particular reference to the significance of the Commonwealth Games ) in particular Manchester in 2000 and Glasgow again in 2012 .   In contrast throughout much of the 20th and 21st Century Birmingham has generally been regarded as the second city of the United Kingdom in terms of populace and GDP while Edinburgh has been promoted as the second city by virtue as the capital of Scotland . Less authoratitive claims have been made on behalf of Cardiff & Belfast due to their status as the respective capital cities of Wales & Northern Ireland .   History   Since the formation of the United Kingdom , several places have been described as the `` second city '' . Dublin was the second most populous city at the time of the formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801 , though it lost that position later in the 19th century as other cities grew through more rapid industrialisation . As such , it was often described as the second city of the UK . Dublin , and the rest of the Republic of Ireland , became independent of the UK in the 1920s .   The title Second City of Empire or Second City of the British Empire was claimed by a number of cities in the 18th , 19th and early 20th centuries . Commercial trading city Liverpool was regarded as holding this title with its massive port , merchant fleet and world-wide trading links . [ http : //www.nottingham.ac.uk/home/ahzsh1/Empire/Project.htm Untitled Document ] Liverpool was constantly referred to as the New York of Europe . Others included Dublin , Glasgow ( which continues to use the title as a marketing slogan ) , and ( outside the UK ) Calcutta and Philadelphia .   Prior to the union with Scotland in 1707 , from the English Civil War until the 18th century , Norwich was the second-largest city of England , being a major trading centre , Britain 's richest provincial city and county town of Norfolk , at that time the most populous county of England . Bristol was the second wealthiest city in England in the 16th century ; and by the 18th century , Bristol was often described as the second city of England . During the 19th century , claims were made for Manchester , Liverpool and York . York had also been named as the second city in earlier centuries .   By the early 19th century , Glasgow was frequently referred to as the second city ; and during much of the 20th century it had a population of over one million , larger than that of Birmingham until the 1951 census . For example , the Official Census population for Glasgow was 0.784 million in April 1911 ; 1.034 million in April 1921 ; 1.088 million in April 1931 and 1.090 million in April 1951 . However , slum clearances in the 1960s led to displacement of residents from the city centre to new communities located outside the city boundaries . This , together with local government reorganisation , resulted in the official population of Glasgow falling sharply . The Glasgow City Council area currently has a population of 600,000 although the surrounding conurbation of Greater Glasgow has a population of 1,199,629 . In contrast , the population of the city of Birmingham has remained steady around the one million mark ; its central population fell like Glasgow 's , but the city boundaries were extended several times in the early 20th century . Occasional claims were made for Liverpool , Birmingham and Manchester .

On the track , he mostly competes over 5000 metres and 10,000 metres , but has run competitively from 1500 metres to the marathon . He was a gold medallist in the 5000 m and 10,000 m at the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2015 World Championships in Athletics . He also completed that double at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics and the European Athletics Championships in 2010 and 2014 ( the first British male winner of all those events ) . He was the second man in history to win long-distance doubles at successive Olympics and World Championships , and the first in history to do the triple-double .   Born in Somalia , Farah moved to the United Kingdom as a child . He was originally based in London and ran for Newham and Essex Beagles athletics club , training at St Mary 's University College , Twickenham from 2001 to 2011 . He has trained with Alberto Salazar in Portland , Oregon since 2011 . Farah runs distances races tactically , but also can maintain a fast pace and has a quick sprint finish .   In addition to the above titles , he was the European 5000 m champion in 2012 , twice 3000 m champion at the European Athletics Indoor Championships ( 2009 and 2011 ) and the winner of the European Cross Country Championships in 2006 .

His full name is Mohamed Muktar Jama Farah and he hails from the Isaaq clan . He spent the early years of his childhood in Djibouti with his twin brother . He later moved to Britain at the age of eight to join his father , speaking barely a word of English . His grandfather , Jama , was born in the British protectorate of Somaliland . His father , Mukhtar Farah , is an IT consultant and a British citizen , who was born in London , England and grew up in Hounslow . Mohamed 's parents had met during a holiday .   Farah attended Isleworth and Syon in Isleworth , and Feltham Community College in Feltham . His athletic talent was first identified by physical education teacher Alan Watkinson . Farah 's ambition was to become a car mechanic or play as a right winger for Arsenal football club . He later joined the Borough of Hounslow Athletics Club in west London .   Junior career   Farah represented Hounslow at cross-country in the London Youth Games . In 1996 , at the age of 13 , he entered the English schools cross-country and finished ninth . The following year he won the first of five English school titles . Recognising his talent , athletics philanthropist Eddie Kulukundis paid the legal fees to complete Farah 's naturalisation as a British citizen , allowing Farah to travel to competitions without visa issues .   Farah 's first major title was at 5000 metres at the European Athletics Junior Championship in 2001 , the same year that he began training at St Mary 's University College , Twickenham . That year , Farah became one of the first two athletes in the newly formed Endurance Performance Centre at St Mary ’ s .

Various grains ( which may be malted ) are used for different varieties , including barley , corn ( maize ) , rye , and wheat . Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks , generally made of charred white oak .   Whisky is a strictly regulated spirit worldwide with many classes and types . The typical unifying characteristics of the different classes and types are the fermentation of grains , distillation , and aging in wooden barrels .   Etymology   The word whisky ( or whiskey ) is an anglicisation of the Classical Gaelic word uisce ( or uisge ) meaning `` water '' ( now written as uisce in Irish Gaelic , and uisge in Scottish Gaelic ) . Distilled alcohol was known in Latin as aqua vitae ( `` water of life '' ) . This was translated to Classical Gaelic as / `` water of life '' . Early forms of the word in English included uskebeaghe ( 1581 ) , usquebaugh ( 1610 ) , usquebath ( 1621 ) , and usquebae ( 1715 ) .   Names and spellings   Much is made of the word 's two spellings : whisky and whiskey . There are two schools of thought on the issue . One is that the spelling difference is simply a matter of regional language convention for the spelling of a word , indicating that the spelling varies depending on the intended audience or the background or personal preferences of the writer ( like the difference between color and colour ; or recognize and recognise ) , and the other is that the spelling should depend on the style or origin of the spirit being described . There is general agreement that when quoting the proper name printed on a label , the spelling on the label should not be altered . Some writers refer to `` whisk ( e ) y '' or `` whisky/whiskey '' to acknowledge the variation .   The spelling whiskey is common in Ireland and the United States , while whisky is used in all other whisky producing countries . In the US , the usage has not always been consistent . From the late eighteenth century to the mid twentieth century , American writers used both spellings interchangeably until the introduction of newspaper style guides . Since the 1960s , American writers have increasingly used whiskey as the accepted spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and whisky for aged grain spirits made outside the US . However , some prominent American brands , such as George Dickel , Maker 's Mark , and Old Forester ( all made by different companies ) , use the whisky spelling on their labels , and the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits , the legal regulations for spirit in the US , also use the whisky spelling throughout .   `` Scotch '' is the internationally recognized term for `` Scotch whisky '' .   History   It is possible that distillation was practised by the Babylonians in Mesopotamia in the 2nd millennium BC , with perfumes and aromatics being distilled , but this is subject to uncertain and disputed interpretation of evidence . The earliest certain chemical distillations were by Greeks in Alexandria in the 1st century AD , but these were not distillations of alcohol . The medieval Arabs adopted the distillation technique of the Alexandrian Greeks , and written records in Arabic begin in the 9th century , but again these were not distillations of alcohol . Distilling technology passed from the medieval Arabs to the medieval Latins , with the earliest records in Latin in the early 12th century.Book [ https : //books.google.com/books ? id  XeqWOkKYn28C & printsecfrontcover A Short History of the Art of Distillation ] , by Robert James Forbes ( year 1948 ) .

The earliest records of the distillation of alcohol are in Italy in the 13th century , where alcohol was distilled from wine . An early description of the technique was given by Ramon Llull ( 1232 – 1315 ) . Its use spread through medieval monasteries , largely for medicinal purposes , such as the treatment of colic and smallpox .   The art of distillation spread to Ireland and Scotland no"], [24, "Speculation abounded over potential nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States by Ronald Reagan even before his presidency officially began , due to the advanced ages of several justices , and Reagan 's own highlighting of Supreme Court nominations as a campaign issue . Reagan had promised `` to appoint only those opposed to abortion and the 'judicial activism ' of the Warren and Burger Courts '' . Conversely , some opposed to Reagan argued that he could `` appoint as many as five Justices '' and would `` use the opportunity to stack the Court against women , minorities and social justice '' .   Sandra Day O'Connor nomination   During his 1980 campaign , Reagan pledged that , if given the opportunity , he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice . That opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart . O'Connor was approved by the Senate by a vote of 99-0 on September 21 , 1981 . Senator Max Baucus ( D-MT ) did not vote .   William Rehnquist elevation   In his second term , Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren Burger as Chief Justice . Rehnquist 's confirmation was largely split along party lines , showing that he had not improved his standing among Senate Democrats since his contentious 1971 nomination to the Court . Rehnquist 's elevation to Chief Justice was approved by the Senate by a vote of 65-33 on September 17 , 1986 . Senators Jake Garn ( R-UT ) and Barry Goldwater ( R-AZ ) did not vote . Senator Alan Simpson ( R-WY ) made public note on the Senate floor that Senator Garn 's vote would have been to confirm had he been present .   Democratic Senators who voted against Rehnquist 's confirmation as an Associate Justice in 1971 and as Chief Justice in 1986 were Alan Cranston ( CA ) , Daniel Inouye ( HI ) , Edward M. Kennedy ( MA ) and Claiborne Pell ( RI ) . Two Democrats who voted for Rehnquist 's nomination as Associate Justice voted against his nomination as Chief Justice , Thomas Eagleton ( MO ) and Robert Byrd ( WV ) .   Antonin Scalia nomination   After deciding to elevate Rehnquist to Chief Justice , Reagan considered both Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat left by Rehnquist 's elevation , but ultimately chose the younger and more charismatic Scalia . Scalia was approved by the Senate by a vote of 98-0 on September 17 , 1986 . Senators Jake Garn ( R-UT ) and Barry Goldwater ( R-AZ ) did not vote .   Anthony Kennedy nomination   Robert Bork selection   Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell was a moderate , and even before his expected retirement on June 27 , 1987 , Senate Democrats had asked liberal leaders to form `` a solid phalanx '' to oppose whomever President Ronald Reagan nominated to replace him , assuming it would tilt the court rightward ; Democrats warned Reagan there would be a fight . Reagan considered appointing Utah Senator Orrin Hatch to the seat , but Congress had approved $ 6,000 pay raises for Supreme Court Justices in February , raising a problem under the Ineligibility Clause of the United States Constitution , which prohibits a member of Congress from accepting an appointment for which the pay had been increased during that member 's term . A memorandum by Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper rejected the notion that a Saxbe fix—a rollback of the salary for the position—could satisfy the Ineligibility Clause . Hatch had been on the short list of two finalists with Robert Bork , but after the Ineligibility Clause had been brought to light , Hatch was no longer under consideration . Reagan nominated Robert Bork for the seat on July 1 , 1987 .   Within 45 minutes of Bork 's nomination to the Court , Ted Kennedy ( D-MA ) took to the Senate floor with a strong condemnation of Bork in a nationally televised speech , declaring , `` Robert Bork 's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions , blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters , rogue police could break down citizens ' doors in midnight raids , schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution , writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government , and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens .

He was the first English King of Ireland , and continued the nominal claim by English monarchs to the Kingdom of France . Henry was the second monarch of the Tudor dynasty , succeeding his father , Henry VII .   Henry is known for his consequential role in the separation of the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church , besides his six marriages and many extramarital affairs , as well as his effort to obtain an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon , which led to conflict with the Pope . His disagreements with the Pope led Henry to separate the Church of England from papal authority , with himself as king and as the Supreme Head of the Church of England ; the disputes also led to the Dissolution of the Monasteries . His principal dispute was with papal authority rather than with doctrinal matters , and he remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings despite his excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church . Henry oversaw the legal union of England and Wales with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . He is also well known for a long personal rivalry with both Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , with whom he frequently warred .   Domestically , Henry is known for his radical changes to the English Constitution , ushering in the theory of the divine right of kings to England . Besides asserting the sovereign 's supremacy over the Church of England , thus initiating the English Reformation , he greatly expanded royal power . Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quash dissent , and those accused were often executed without a formal trial , by means of bills of attainder . He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers , some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour . People such as Thomas Wolsey , Thomas More , Thomas Cromwell , Richard Rich , and Thomas Cranmer figured prominently in Henry 's administration . He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and acts of the Reformation Parliament to convert money into royal revenue that was formerly paid to Rome . Despite the influx of money from these sources , Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly continental wars .   His contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive , educated , and accomplished king , and he has been described as `` one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne '' . Besides ruling with considerable power , he was also an author and composer . His desire to provide England with a male heir stemmed partly from personal vanity and partly from his belief that a daughter would be unable to consolidate Tudor power and maintain the fragile peace that existed following the Wars of the Roses . This led to the two things for which Henry is most remembered : his six marriages and his break with the Pope ( who would not allow an annulment of Henry 's first marriage ) . As he aged , Henry became severely obese and his health suffered , contributing to his death in 1547 . He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful , egotistical , harsh , and insecure king . He was succeeded by his son Edward VI .   Early years   Born 28June 1491 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich , London , Henry Tudor was the third child and second son of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York . Of the young Henry 's six siblings , only three – Arthur , Prince of Wales ; Margaret ; and Mary – survived infancy . He was baptised by Richard Fox , the Bishop of Exeter , at a church of the Observant Franciscans close to the palace . In 1493 , at the age of two , Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports . He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three , and was inducted into the Order of the Bath soon after . The day after the ceremony he was created Duke of York and a month or so later made Warden of the Scottish Marches . In May 1495 , he was appointed"], [26, "The English term enlightenment is the western translation of the term bodhi , `` awakening '' , which was popularised in the Western world through the 19th century translations of Max Müller . It has the western connotation of a sudden insight into a transcendental truth .   The term is also being used to translate several other Buddhist terms and concepts used to denote insight ( prajna , kensho and satori ) ; knowledge ( vidhya ) ; the `` blowing out '' ( Nirvana ) of disturbing emotions and desires and the subsequent freedom or release ( vimutti ) ; and the attainment of Buddhahood , as exemplified by Gautama Buddha .   What exactly constituted the Buddha 's awakening is unknown . It may probably have involved the knowledge that liberation was attained by the combination of mindfulness and dhyāna , applied to the understanding of the arising and ceasing of craving . The relation between dhyana and insight is a core problem in the study of Buddhism , and is one of the fundamentals of Buddhist practice .   In the western world the concept of ( spiritual ) enlightenment has taken on a romantic meaning . It has become synonymous with self-realization and the true self and false self , being regarded as a substantial essence being covered over by social conditioning. , , ,   Translation   Robert S. Cohen notes that the majority of English books on Buddhism use the term `` enlightenment '' to translate the term bodhi . The root budh , from which both bodhi and Buddha are derived , means `` to wake up '' or `` to recover consciousness '' . Cohen notes that bodhi is not the result of an illumination , but of a path of realization , or coming to understanding . The term `` enlightenment '' is event-oriented , whereas the term `` awakening '' is process-oriented . The western use of the term `` enlighten '' has Christian roots , as in Calvin 's `` It is God alone who enlightens our minds to perceive his truths '' .   Early 19th century bodhi was translated as `` intelligence '' . The term `` enlighten '' was first being used in 1835 , in an English translation of a French article , while the first recorded use of the term 'enlightenment ' is credited ( by the Oxford English Dictionary ) to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal ( February , 1836 ) . In 1857 The Times used the term `` the Enlightened '' for the Buddha in a short article , which was reprinted the following year by Max Müller . Thereafter , the use of the term subsided , but reappeared with the publication of Max Müller 's Chips from a german Workshop , which included a reprint from the Times-article . The book was translated 1969 into German , using the term `` der Erleuchtete '' . Max Müller was an essentialist , who believed in a natural religion , and saw religion as an inherent capacity of human beings . `` Enlightenment '' was a means to capture natural religious truths , as distinguished from mere mythology .   By the mid-1870s it had become commonplace to call the Buddha `` enlightened '' , and by the end of the 1880s the terms `` enlightened '' and `` enlightenment '' dominated the English literature .   Terms   Insight   Bodhi   Bodhi ( Sanskrit , Pāli ) , from the verbal root budd , `` to awaken '' , `` to understand '' , means literally `` to have woken up and understood '' . According to Johannes Bronkhorst , Tillman Vetter , and K.R . Norman , bodhi was at first not specified . K.R . Norman :   According to Norman , bodhi may basically have meant the knowledge that nibbana was attained , due to the practice of dhyana . Originally only `` prajna '' may have been mentioned , and Tillman Vetter even concludes that originally dhyana itself was deemed liberating , with the stilling of pleasure of pain in the fourth jhana . Gombrich also argues that the emphasis on insight is a later development .   In Theravada Buddhism , bodhi refers to the realisation of the four stages of enlightenment and becoming an Arahant . In Theravada Buddhism , bodhi is equal to supreme insight , and the realisation of the four noble truths , which leads to deliverance . According to Nyanatiloka ,   This equation of bodhi with the four noble truths is a later development , in response to developments within"], [27, "Brownsville is a city in Haywood County , Tennessee .

More broadly , `` the sea '' is the interconnected system of Earth 's salty , oceanic waters—considered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions . The sea moderates Earth 's climate and has important roles in the water cycle , carbon cycle , and nitrogen cycle . Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory , the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s . The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including the IHO 's four named oceans ( the Atlantic , Pacific , Indian , and Arctic ) and the Southern Ocean ; smaller , second-order sections , such as the Mediterranean , are known as seas .   Owing to the present state of continental drift , the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea ( a ratio of about 2:3 ) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic ( 1:4.7 ) .Reddy , M.P.M .

Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5 % by mass , although this can vary in more landlocked waters , near the mouths of large rivers , or at great depths . About 85 % of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride . Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature . Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides , the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun . The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth ( the Coriolis effect ) .   Former changes in the sea levels have left continental shelves , shallow areas in the sea close to land . These nutrient-rich waters teem with life , which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish , but also shellfish , mammals , and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed . The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs . Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales ' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting . Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters : even under enormous depths and pressures , nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem . Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth 's atmosphere ; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea .   The sea is an essential aspect of human trade , travel , mineral extraction , and power generation . This has also made it essential to warfare and left major cities exposed to earthquakes and volcanoes from nearby faults ; powerful tsunami waves ; and hurricanes , typhoons , and cyclones produced in the tropics . This importance and duality has affected human culture , from early sea gods to the epic poetry of Homer to the changes induced by the Columbian Exchange , from Viking funerals to Basho 's haikus to hyperrealist marine art , and inspiring music ranging from the shanties in The Complaynt of Scotland to Rimsky-Korsakov 's `` The Sea and Sinbad 's Ship '' to A-mei 's `` Listen to the Sea '' . It is the scene of leisure activities including swimming , diving , surfing , and sailing . However , population growth , industrialization , and intensive farming have all contributed to present-day marine pollution . Atmospheric carbon dioxide is being absorbed in increasing amounts , lowering its pH in a process known as ocean acidification . The shared nature of the sea has made overfishing an increasing problem .   Definition   Both senses of sea date to Old English ; the larger sense has required a definite article since Early Middle English . As the term has been applied over time , there are no sharp distinctions between seas and oceans , although seas are smaller and are—with the notable exception of the Sargasso Sea created by the North Atlantic Gyre—usually bounded by land on a smaller scale than multiple continents .

An assassination may be prompted by religious , political , or military motives ; it is an act that may be done for financial gain , to avenge a grievance , from a desire to acquire fame or notoriety , or because of a military , security or insurgent group 's command to carry out the homicide .   Etymology   The word assassin is often believed to derive from the word Hashshashin ( Arabic : حشّاشين , ħashshāshīyīn , also Hashishin , Hashashiyyin , or Assassins ) , and shares its etymological roots with hashish ( or ; from Arabic : ' ) . It referred to a group of Nizari Shia Persians who worked against various Arab and Persian targets .   Founded by the Persian Hassan-i Sabbah , the Assassins were active in the fortress of Alamut in Iran from the 8th to the 14th centuries , and also controlled the castle of Masyaf in Syria . The group killed members of the Persian , Abbasid , Seljuq , and Christian Crusader élite for political and religious reasons .   Although it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of hashish during their killings or during their indoctrination , there is debate as to whether these claims have merit , with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name . The earliest known literary use of the word assassination is in Macbeth by William Shakespeare ( 1605 ) .   The word for `` murder '' in many Romance languages is derived from this same root word ( see Spanish asesinato ) .   Use in history   Ancient to medieval times   Assassination is one of the oldest tools of power politics . It dates back at least as far as recorded history .   The Old Testament story of Judith illustrates how a woman frees the Israelites by tricking and assassinating Holofernes , a warlord of the rival Assyrians , with whom the Israelites were at war . King Joash of Judah was recorded as being assassinated by his own servants ; Joab assassinated Absalom , King David 's son ; and King Sennacherib of Assyria was assassinated by his own sons .   Chanakya ( c. 350–283 BC ) wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise Arthashastra . His student Chandragupta Maurya , the founder of the Maurya Empire , later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies , including two of Alexander the Great 's generals , Nicanor and Philip . Other famous victims are Philip II of Macedon ( 336 BC ) , the father of Alexander the Great , and Roman consul Julius Caesar ( 44 BC ) . Emperors of Rome often met their end in this way , as did many of the Muslim Shia Imams hundreds of years later . The practice was also well known in ancient China , as in Jing Ke 's failed assassination of Qin king Ying Zheng in 227 BC . Whilst many assassination were performed by an individual or a small group , there were also specialized units who used a collective group of people to perform more than one assassination . The earliest were the sicarii in 6 A.D. , who predated the Middle Eastern assassins and Japanese ninjas by centuries .   In the Middle Ages , regicide was rare in Western Europe , but it was a recurring theme in the Eastern Roman Empire . Blinding and strangling in the bathtub were the most commonly used procedures . With the Renaissance , tyrannicide—or assassination for personal or political reasons—became more common again in Western Europe . High medieval sources mention the assassination of King Demetrius Zvonimir ( 1089 ) , dying at the hands of his own people , who objected to a proposition by the Pope to go on a campaign to aid the Byzantines against the Seljuk Turks . This account is , however , contentious among historians , it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes . The myth of the `` Curse of King Zvonimir '' is based on the legend of his assassination . In 1192 , Conrad of Montferrat , the de facto King of Jerusalem , was killed by an assassin .

It is situated across a group of 117 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by bridges . These are located in the marshy Venetian Lagoon which stretches along the shoreline , between the mouths of the Po and the Piave Rivers . Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings , their architecture , and artwork . The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site .   In 2009 , 270,098 people resided in Venice 's comune ( the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia ; of whom around 60,000 live in the historic city of Venice ( Centro storico ) ; 176,000 in Terraferma ( the mainland ) , mostly in the large frazioni ( roughly equivalent to `` parishes '' or `` wards '' in other countries ) of Mestre and Marghera ; and 31,000 on other islands in the lagoon ) . Together with Padua and Treviso , the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area ( PATREVE ) , with a total population of 2,600,000 . PATREVE is only a statistical metropolitan area without any degree of autonomy .   The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC . The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice . Venice has been known as the `` La Dominante '' , `` Serenissima '' , `` Queen of the Adriatic '' , `` City of Water '' , `` City of Masks '' , `` City of Bridges '' , `` The Floating City '' , and `` City of Canals '' .   The Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance , and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto , as well as a very important center of commerce ( especially silk , grain , and spice ) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century . This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history . It is also known for its several important artistic movements , especially the Renaissance period . After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna , the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire , until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 , following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence . Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music , and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi .   Etymology   The name of the city , deriving from Latin forms Venetia and Venetiae , is most likely taken from `` Venetia et Histria '' , the Roman name of Regio X of Roman Italy , but applied to the coastal part of the region that remained under Roman Empire outside of Gothic , Lombard , and Frankish control . The name Venetia , however , derives from the Roman name for the people known as the Veneti , and called by the Greeks Eneti ( Ἐνετοί ) . The meaning of the word is uncertain , although there are other Indo-European tribes with similar-sounding names , such as the Celtic Veneti , Baltic Veneti , and the Slavic Wends . Linguists suggest that the name is based on an Indo-European root * wen ( `` love '' ) , so that * wenetoi would mean `` beloved '' , `` lovable '' , or `` friendly '' . A connection with the Latin word venetus , meaning the color 'sea-blue ' , is also possible .  Supposed connections of Venetia with the Latin verb venire ( to come ) , such as Marin Sanudo 's veni etiam ( `` Yet , I have come ! `` ) , the supposed cry of the first refugees to the Venetian lagoon from the mainland , or even with venia ( `` forgiveness '' ) are fanciful . The alternative obsolete form is Vinegia ; ( Venetian : Venèxia ; ; ) .   History   Origins   Although no surviving historical records deal directly with the founding of Venice , tradition and the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original population of Venice consisted of refugees from Roman cities near Venice such as Padua , Aquileia , Treviso , Altino and Concordia ( modern Portogruaro ) and from the undefended countryside , who were fleeing successive waves"], [31, "The Beatles were an English rock band , formed in Liverpool in 1960 . With members John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era . Rooted in skiffle , beat , and 1950s rock and roll , the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles , ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock , often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways . In the early 1960s , their enormous popularity first emerged as `` Beatlemania '' , but as the group 's music grew in sophistication , led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney , they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s .   The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960 , with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player . The core of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers , most notably Pete Best , before asking Starr to join them . Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act , and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings , greatly expanding their popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit , `` Love Me Do '' , in late 1962 . They acquired the nickname `` the Fab Four '' as Beatlemania grew in Britain the next year , and by early 1964 became international stars , leading the `` British Invasion '' of the United States pop market . From 1965 onwards , the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings , including the widely influential albums Rubber Soul ( 1965 ) , Revolver ( 1966 ) , Sgt . Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( 1967 ) , The Beatles ( commonly known as the White Album , 1968 ) and Abbey Road ( 1969 ) .   After their break-up in 1970 , they each enjoyed successful musical careers of varying lengths . McCartney and Starr , the surviving members , remain musically active . Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980 , and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001 .   According to the RIAA , the Beatles are the best-selling music artists in the United States , with 178 million certified units . They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act . In 2008 , the group topped Billboard magazine 's list of the all-time most successful `` Hot 100 '' artists ; , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty . They have received ten Grammy Awards , an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards . Collectively included in Time magazine 's compilation of the twentieth century 's 100 most influential people , they are the best-selling band in history , with estimated sales of over 600 million records worldwide . The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 , and all four were inducted individually from 1994 to 2015 .   History   1957–62 : Formation , Hamburg , and UK popularity   In March 1957 , John Lennon , then aged sixteen , formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank school . They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks , before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name . Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July . In February 1958 , McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band . The fourteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon , impressing him with his playing , but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young to join them . After a month of Harrison 's persistence , they enlisted him as their lead guitarist . By January 1959 , Lennon 's Quarry Bank friends had left the group , and he began studies at the Liverpool College of Art . The three guitarists , billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs , were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer . Lennon 's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe , who had recently sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar , joined in January 1960 , and it was he who suggested changing the band 's name to Beatals , as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets .

The Commonwealth operates by intergovernmental consensus of the member states , organised through the Commonwealth Secretariat , and non-governmental organisations , organised through the Commonwealth Foundation .   The Commonwealth dates back to the mid-20th century with the decolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its territories . It was formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 , which established the member states as `` free and equal '' . The symbol of this free association is Queen Elizabeth II who is the Head of the Commonwealth . The Queen is also the monarch of 16 members of the Commonwealth , known as Commonwealth realms . The other Commonwealth members have different heads of state : 32 members are republics and five are monarchies with a different monarch .   Member states have no legal obligation to one another . Instead , they are united by language , history , culture and their shared values of democracy , human rights , and the rule of law . These values are enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter and promoted by the quadrennial Commonwealth Games . On 3 October 2013 , after 48 years of membership , The Gambia became the most recent nation to withdraw from the Commonwealth .   The Commonwealth covers more than 29958050 km2 , almost a quarter of the world 's land area , and spans all six inhabited continents . With an estimated population of 2.328 billion , nearly a third of the world population , the Commonwealth in 2014 produced a nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ) of $ 10.45 trillion , representing 17 % of the gross world product when measured in purchasing power parity ( PPP ) and 14 % of the gross world product when measured nominally .   History   Origin   Queen Elizabeth II , in her address to Canada on Dominion Day in 1959 , pointed out that the confederation of Canada on 1 July 1867 had been the birth of the `` first independent country within the British Empire '' . She declared : `` So , it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of Nations . '' As long ago as 1884 , however , Lord Rosebery , while visiting Australia , had described the changing British Empire—as some of its colonies became more independent—as a `` Commonwealth of Nations '' . Conferences of British and colonial prime ministers occurred periodically from the first one in 1887 , leading to the creation of the Imperial Conferences in 1911 .   The Commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences . A specific proposal was presented by Jan Smuts in 1917 when he coined the term `` the British Commonwealth of Nations '' and envisioned the `` future constitutional relations and readjustments in essence '' at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 by delegates from the Dominions as well as Britain . The term first received imperial statutory recognition in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 , when the term British Commonwealth of Nations was substituted for British Empire in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the Irish Free State .   Dominions   In the Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference , Britain and its dominions agreed they were `` equal in status , in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs , though united by common allegiance to the Crown , and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations . '' These aspects to the relationship were formalised by the Statute of Westminster in 1931 , which applied to Canada without the need for ratification , but Australia , New Zealand , and Newfoundland had to ratify the statute for it to take effect . Newfoundland never did , as on 16 February 1934 , with the consent of its parliament , the government of Newfoundland voluntarily ended and governance reverted to direct control from London . Newfoundland later joined Canada as its 10th province in 1949 . Australia and New Zealand ratified the Statute in 1942 and 1947 respectively .   Although the Union of South Africa was not among the Dominions that needed to adopt the Statute of Westminster for it to take effect , two laws—the Status of the Union Act , 1934 , and the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act of 1934—were passed to confirm South Africa 's status"], [33, "Prague ( ; , , ) is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic . It is the 14th largest city in the European Union . It is also the historical capital of Bohemia . Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava River , the city is home to about 1.26 million people , while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million . The city has a temperate climate , with warm summers and chilly winters . Prague has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union .   Prague has been a political , cultural , and economic centre of central Europe with waxing and waning fortunes during its 1,100-year existence . Founded during the Romanesque and flourishing by the Gothic , Renaissance and Baroque eras , Prague was not only the capital of the Czech state , but also the seat of two Holy Roman Emperors and thus also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire . It was an important city to the Habsburg Monarchy and its Austro-Hungarian Empire and after World War I became the capital of Czechoslovakia . The city played major roles in the Bohemian and Protestant Reformation , the Thirty Years ' War , and in 20th-century history , during both World Wars and the post-war Communist era .   Prague is home to a number of famous cultural attractions , many of which survived the violence and destruction of 20th-century Europe . Main attractions include the Prague Castle , the Charles Bridge , Old Town Square with the Prague astronomical clock , the Jewish Quarter , Petřín hill and Vyšehrad . Since 1992 , the extensive historic centre of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites .   The city boasts more than ten major museums , along with numerous theatres , galleries , cinemas , and other historical exhibits . An extensive modern public transportation system connects the city . Also , it is home to a wide range of public and private schools , including Charles University in Prague , the oldest university in Central Europe . Prague is classified as an `` Alpha- '' global city according to GaWC studies , comparable to Vienna , Seoul and Washington , D.C. Prague ranked sixth in the Tripadvisor world list of best destinations in 2016 . Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination , and the city receives more than 6.4 million international visitors annually , . Prague is the fifth most visited European city after London , Paris , Istanbul and Rome . Prague 's low cost of living makes it a popular destination for expats relocating to Europe .   History   During the thousand years of its existence , the city grew from a settlement stretching from Prague Castle in the north to the fort of Vyšehrad in the south , becoming the multicultural capital of a modern European state , the Czech Republic , a member state of the European Union .   Early history   The area on which Prague was founded was settled as early as the Paleolithic age . According to the Jewish historian and chronicler David Solomon Ganz ( 1541–1613 ) , author of a book published in Hebrew , entitled Tzemach Dovid , the city was founded by an ancient king , Boyya ( Boiia ) , in c. 1306 BC.Tzemach Dovid , David Solomon Ganz , Warsaw , 1878 , p. 71 ( [ http : //www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx ? req  21930 & st & pgnum  72 & hilitep . 72 ] in pdf ) . The dates are brought down in Anno Mundi , the year [ 2 ] 455 anno mundi being in the abbreviated form , without the millennium : e.g . תנה  455 of the 3rd millennium ( Hebrew ) . In the words of Ganz ( Translated from the Hebrew ) : `` [ 2 ] 455 . Boiia reigned over Ashkenaz during the days of king Ashketāris , around the year [ 2 ] 455 [ anno mundi ] , and was a strong and valiant king , and a man of war , and he conquered and built a good and large land , calling it after his own name , Bayern ( Bavaria ) . He also built a large city on the Inn river , and called it Boioduron . It is the city whose name was changed afterwards to Passau , unto this very day . King Boiia also conquered that fat and broad land , and called it Boihaem ( Bohemia ) , after his own name , to this very day ."], [34, "Herman Cyril McNeile , MC ( 28 September 1888 – 14 August 1937 ) , commonly known as Cyril McNeile and publishing under the name H. C. McNeile or the pseudonym Sapper , was a British soldier and author . Drawing on his experiences in the trenches during the First World War , he started writing short stories and getting them published in the Daily Mail . As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names , he was given the pen name `` Sapper '' by Lord Northcliffe , the owner of the Daily Mail ; the nickname was based on that of his corps , the Royal Engineers .   After the war McNeile left the army and continued writing , although he changed from war stories to thrillers . In 1920 he published Bulldog Drummond , whose eponymous hero became his best-known creation . The character was based on McNeile himself , on his friend Gerard Fairlie and on English gentlemen generally . McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels , as well as three plays and a screenplay .   McNeile interspersed his Drummond work with other novels and story collections that included two characters who appeared as protagonists in their own works , Jim Maitland and Ronald Standish . He was one of the most successful British popular authors of the inter-war period before his death in 1937 from throat cancer , which has been attributed to damage sustained from a gas attack in the war .   McNeile 's stories are either directly about the war , or contain people whose lives have been shaped by it . His thrillers are a continuation of his war stories , with upper class Englishmen defending England from foreigners plotting against it . Although he was seen at the time as `` simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen '' , after the Second World War his work was criticised as having fascist overtones , while also displaying the xenophobia and anti-semitism apparent in some other writers of the period .   Biography   Early life   McNeile was born in Bodmin , Cornwall . He was the son of Malcolm McNeile , a captain in the Royal Navy who at the time was governor of the naval prison at Bodmin , and Christiana Mary ( née Sloggett ) . The McNeile family had ancestral roots from both Belfast and Scotland , and counted a general in the British Indian Army among their members .   McNeile did not like either of his given names but preferred to be called Cyril , although he was always known by his friends as Mac . After attending a prep school in Eastbourne , he was further educated at Cheltenham College . On leaving the college , he joined the Royal Military Academy , Woolwich , from which he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant in July 1907 . He underwent further training at the Royal School of Military Engineering before a short posting to Aldershot Garrison . He received promotion to lieutenant in June 1910 and was posted to Canterbury , serving three years with the 3rd Field Troop , until January 1914 , when he was posted to Malta .   In 1914 McNeile was promoted to the rank of captain . He was still in Malta when the war broke out and was ordered to France in October 1914 ; he travelled via England and married Violet Evelyn Baird on 31 October 1914 . Baird was the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Baird Douglas of the Cameron Highlanders .   First World War service   On 2 November 1914 McNeile travelled to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force . Few details are known about McNeile 's wartime service , as his records were destroyed by incendiary bombs during the Second World War . He spent time with a number of Royal Engineer units on the Western Front , including 1st Field Squadron RE , 15th Field Company RE and RE elements of the 33rd Division .   McNeile 's first known published story , Reminiscences of Sergeant Michael Cassidy , was serialised on page four of the Daily Mail from 13 January 1915 . As serving officers in the British Army were not permitted to publish under their own names except during their half-pay sabbaticals , many would write under a pseudonym ; Lord Northcliffe , the owner of the Daily Mail , gave McNeile the pen name `` Sapper '' , as the Royal Engineers were commonly known as the Sappers . McNeile later confided that he had started writing"], [35, "A hongi is a traditional Māori greeting in New Zealand . It is done by pressing one 's nose and forehead ( at the same time ) to another person at an encounter .   It is used at traditional meetings among Māori people and on major ceremonies and serves a similar purpose to a formal handshake in modern western culture , and indeed a hongi is often used in conjunction with one .   In the hongi , the ha ( or breath of life ) , is exchanged and intermingled . The breath of life can also be interpreted as the sharing of both party 's souls .   Through the exchange of this physical greeting , one is no longer considered manuhiri ( visitor ) but rather tangata whenua , one of the people of the land . For the remainder of one 's stay one is obliged to share in all the duties and responsibilities of the home people . In earlier times , this may have meant bearing arms in times of war , or tending crops , such as kumara .   When Māori greet one another by pressing noses , the tradition of sharing the breath of life is considered to have come directly from the gods .   In Māori folklore , woman was created by the gods moulding her shape out of the earth . The god Tāne ( meaning male ) embraced the figure and breathed into her nostrils . She then sneezed and came to life . Her name was Hineahuone ( earth formed woman ) .

It is regarded by historians as the century in which the rise of the West occurred .  During the 16th century , Spain and Portugal explored the world 's seas and opened world-wide oceanic trade routes . Large parts of the New World became Spanish and Portuguese colonies , and while the Portuguese became the masters of Asia 's and Africa 's Indian Ocean trade , the Spanish opened trade across the Pacific Ocean , linking the Americas with Asia .   This era of colonialism established mercantilism as the leading school of economic thought , where the economic system was viewed as a zero-sum game in which any gain by one party required a loss by another . The mercantilist doctrine encouraged the many intra-European wars of the period and arguably fueled European expansion and imperialism throughout the world until the 19th century or early 20th century .   In Europe , the Protestant Reformation gave a major blow to the authority of the papacy and the Roman Catholic Church . European politics became dominated by religious conflicts , with the groundwork for the epochal Thirty Years ' War being laid towards the end of the century . In Italy , Luca Pacioli published the first work ever on accounting and Galileo Galilei made the first thermometer . In United Kingdom , the Italian Alberico Gentili wrote the first book on public international law and divided secularism from canon law and Roman Catholic theology .   In the Middle East , the Ottoman Empire continued to expand , with the Sultan taking the title of Caliph , while dealing with a resurgent Persia . Iran and Iraq were caught by major popularity of the once-obscure Shiite sect of Islam under the rule of the Safavid dynasty of warrior-mystics , providing grounds for a Persia independent of the majority-Sunni Muslim world .   China evacuated the coastal areas , because of Japanese piracy . Japan was suffering a severe civil war at the time .   Mughal Emperor Akbar extended the power of the Mughal Empire to cover most of the South Asian sub continent . His rule significantly influenced arts , and culture in the region .   Copernicus proposed the heliocentric universe , which was met with strong resistance , and Tycho Brahe refuted the theory of celestial spheres through observational measurement of the 1572 appearance of a Milky Way supernova .

It is the 17th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series . It stars Rod Taylor and Cate Bauer as , respectively , the voices of Pongo and Perdita , its canine protagonists , and Betty Lou Gerson as the voice of Cruella de Vil , its antagonist who kidnaps their puppies .   The film was originally released to theaters on January 25 , 1961 , by Buena Vista Distribution . Upon release , it was a box office hit , successfully pulling the studio out of the financial setbacks caused by Sleeping Beauty , a costlier production released two years prior . Aside from its box office revenue , its commercial success was due to the employment of inexpensive animation techniques—such as using xerography during the process of inking and painting traditional animation cels—that kept production costs down . It was reissued to cinemas four times : in 1969 , 1979 , 1985 and 1991 . The 1991 reissue was the twentieth highest earning film of the year for domestic earnings . It was remade into a live action film in 1996 .   Plot   Songwriter Roger Radcliffe lives in a bachelor flat in London , along with his dalmatian , Pongo . Bored with bachelor life , Pongo decides to find a wife for Roger and a mate for himself . While watching various female dog-human pairs out the window , he spots the perfect one , a woman named Anita and her female dalmatian , Perdita . He quickly gets Roger out of the house and drags him through the park to arrange a meeting . He and Anita fall in love and get married .   Later , Perdita gives birth to a litter of fifteen puppies . That same night , they are visited by Cruella De Vil , a wealthy former schoolmate of Anita 's . She offers to buy the entire litter , but Roger says they are not for sale . A few weeks later , she hires her henchmen , Jasper and Horace , to steal them . When Scotland Yard is unable to find them , Pongo and Perdita use the `` Twilight bark '' , a canine gossip line , to ask for help from the other dogs in London .   Colonel , an old sheepdog , along with his compatriots Captain , a gray horse , and Sergeant Tibbs , a tabby cat , find the puppies in a place called Hell Hall ( Cruella 's abandoned and dilapidated family estate , also known as The De Vil Place ) , along with many other dalmatian puppies that she had bought from various dog stores . When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin fur coats , Colonel quickly sends word back to London . Upon receiving the message , Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies . Winter has come , and they have to cross the Stour River which is running fast and laden with slabs of broken ice . Meanwhile , Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them . In response , Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television , but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house . Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies . While the adult dogs attack them , Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house .   After a happy reunion with their own puppies , Pongo and Perdita realize there are dozens of others with them , 99 altogether including their own . Shocked at Cruella 's plans , they decide to adopt all of them , certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them . They begin making their way back to London through deep snow ; all open water is frozen solid . Other animals help them along the way . Cruella , Jasper , and Horace chase them . In one town , they cover themselves with soot so they appear to be labrador retrievers , then pile inside a moving van bound for London .

They live on Oil Drum Lane , a fictional street in Shepherd 's Bush , London . Four series were broadcast by the BBC from 1962 to 1965 , followed by a second run from 1970 to 1974 . Its theme tune , `` Old Ned '' , was composed by Ron Grainer . The series was voted 15th in a 2004 BBC poll to find Britain 's Best Sitcom . It was remade in the US as Sanford and Son , in Sweden as Albert & Herbert and in the Netherlands as Stiefbeen en zoon . In 1972 a film adaptation of the series , Steptoe and Son , was released in cinemas , with a second Steptoe and Son Ride Again in 1973 .   The series focused on the inter-generational conflict of father and son . Albert Steptoe , a `` dirty old man '' , is an old rag-and-bone man , set in his grimy and grasping ways . By contrast his 37-year-old son Harold is filled with social aspirations , not to say pretensions . The show contained elements of drama and tragedy , as Harold was continually prevented from achieving his ambitions . To this end the show was unusual at the time for casting actors rather than comedians in its lead roles , although both actors were drawn into more comedic roles as a consequence .   Background   The show had its roots in a 1962 episode of Galton & Simpson 's Comedy Playhouse . Galton and Simpson 's association with comedian Tony Hancock , for whom they had written Hancock 's Half Hour , had ended and they had agreed to a proposal from the BBC to write a series of ten comedy shows . The fourth in the series , `` The Offer '' , was born both out of writer 's block and budgetary constraints . Earlier shows in the series had cost more than expected , so the writers decided to write a two-hander set in one room . The idea of two brothers was considered but father and son worked best . Ronald Fraser was second choice for Harold , which would have produced a totally different character .   Galton and Simpson were not aiming to make a pilot for a series , having worked for seven years with Hancock . However , Tom Sloan , the BBC 's Head of Comedy , told them during rehearsals that `` The Offer '' was a definite series pilot : he saw that the Steptoe idea had potential , as did the audience of that edition of Comedy Playhouse . Galton and Simpson were reportedly overwhelmed by this reaction , and the first of what became eight series was commissioned , the first four of which were transmitted between 1962 and 1965 . The last four series were broadcast between 1970 and 1974 , now in colour . At the peak of the series ' popularity , it commanded viewing figures of some 28 million per episode . In addition , the early 1970s saw two feature films , two 46-minute Christmas specials . In 2005 , the play Steptoe and Son in Murder at Oil Drum Lane , written by Ray Galton and John Antrobus , brought the storyline to a close .   The series was one of the first UK situation comedy programmes to employ actors rather than comedians in the principal roles . Galton and Simpson had decided that they wanted to try to write for performers who `` did n't count their laughs '' .   The series ' title music , `` Old Ned '' , won its composer Ron Grainer his second successive Ivor Novello award . The series had no standard set of opening titles but the opening sequences would often feature the Steptoes ' horse , Hercules . `` Steptoe and Son '' is the Steptoes ' trading name , but as established in the first episode , the `` Son '' is not Harold but Albert . The name dates from when he and his mother—Mrs . Steptoe—worked the rounds . The first series has the pair as very rough looking and often dirty and in ragged clothes but they quickly `` tidied up '' for later series .   Outside filming of the Steptoe 's yard took place at a car breakers ' yard in Norland Gardens , London W11 , then changing to Stable Way , Latimer Road , for the later series . Both sites have subsequently been redeveloped with no evidence now remaining of the iconic entrance"], [40, "Ashley Michelle Tisdale ( born July 2 , 1985 ) is an American actress , singer , and producer .

Spurlock 's film follows a 30-day period from February 1 to March 2 , 2003 , during which he ate only McDonald 's food . The film documents this lifestyle 's drastic effect on Spurlock 's physical and psychological well-being , and explores the fast food industry 's corporate influence , including how it encourages poor nutrition for its own profit .   Spurlock ate at McDonald 's restaurants three times per day , eating every item on the chain 's menu at least once . Spurlock consumed an average of 20.9 megajoules or 5,000 kcal ( the equivalent of 9.26 Big Macs ) per day during the experiment . An intake of around 2,500 kcal within a healthy balanced diet is more generally recommended for a man to maintain his weight . As a result , the then-32-year-old Spurlock gained , a 13 % body mass increase , increased his cholesterol to 230 mg/dL , and experienced mood swings , sexual dysfunction , and fat accumulation in his liver . It took Spurlock fourteen months to lose the weight gained from his experiment using a vegan diet supervised by his then-girlfriend , a chef who specializes in gourmet vegan dishes .   The reason for Spurlock 's investigation was the increasing spread of obesity throughout U.S. society , which the Surgeon General has declared `` epidemic '' , and the corresponding lawsuit brought against McDonald 's on behalf of two overweight girls , who , it was alleged , became obese as a result of eating McDonald 's food ( Pelman v. McDonald 's Corp. , 237 F. Supp . 2d 512 ) . Spurlock points out that although the lawsuit against McDonald 's failed ( and subsequently many state legislatures have legislated against product liability actions against producers and distributors of `` fast food '' ) , much of the same criticism leveled against the tobacco companies applies to fast food franchises whose product is both physiologically addictive and physically harmful .   The documentary was nominated for an Academy Award for Documentary Feature . A comic book related to the movie has been made with Dark Horse Comics as the publisher containing stories based on numerous cases of fast food health scares .   Content   As the film begins , Spurlock is in physically above average shape according to his personal trainer . He is seen by three physicians ( a cardiologist , a gastroenterologist , and a general practitioner ) , as well as a nutritionist and a personal trainer . All of the health professionals predict the `` McDiet '' will have unwelcome effects on his body , but none expected anything too drastic , one citing the human body as being `` extremely adaptable '' . Prior to the experiment , Spurlock ate a varied diet but always had vegan evening meals to appease his girlfriend , Alexandra , a vegan chef . At the beginning of the experiment , Spurlock , who stood 6 feet 2 inches ( 185.42 cm ) tall , had a body weight of 84 kg .   Experiment   Spurlock followed specific rules governing his eating habits :  * He must fully eat three McDonald 's meals per day : breakfast , lunch , and dinner .  * He must consume every item on the McDonald 's menu at least once over the course of the 30 days ( he managed this in nine days ) .  * He must only ingest items that are offered on the McDonald 's menu , including bottled water . All outside consumption of food is prohibited .  * He must Super Size the meal when offered , but only when offered ( i.e. , he is not able to Super Size items himself ; Spurlock was offered 9 times , 5 of which were in Texas ) .  * He will attempt to walk about as much as a typical United States citizen , based on a suggested figure of 5,000 standardized distance steps per day , but he did not closely adhere to this , as he walked more while in New York than in Houston .   On February 1 , Spurlock starts the month with breakfast near his home in Manhattan , where there is an average of four McDonald 's locations ( and 66,950 residents , with twice as many commuters ) per square mile ( 2.6 km² ) . He aims to keep the distances he walks in line with the 5,000 steps ( approximately two miles ) walked per day"], [42, "The modern Olympic Games or Olympics ( ) are the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions . The Olympic Games are considered to be the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart .   Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority .   The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . As a result , the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games . World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916 , 1940 , and 1944 Games . Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games .   The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations ( IFs ) , National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) , and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games . As the decision-making body , the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games , and organizes and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter . The IOC also determines the Olympic program , consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games . There are several Olympic rituals and symbols , such as the Olympic flag and torch , as well as the opening and closing ceremonies . Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events . The first , second , and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals : gold , silver , and bronze , respectively .   The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented . This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies , including boycotts , doping , bribery , and a terrorist attack in 1972 . Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame . The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world .   Ancient Olympics   The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia , Greece . Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece . These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration , horse and chariot racing events . It has been widely written that during the Games , all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished . This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce . This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars . The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus . The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend ; one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games . According to legend , it was Heracles who first called the Games `` Olympic '' and established the custom of holding them every four years . The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labors , he built the Olympic Stadium as an honor to Zeus . Following its completion , he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a `` stadion '' ( , Latin : stadium , `` stage '' ) , which later became a unit of distance .

It premiered on 5 November 2009 at the Lyttelton Theatre at the Royal National Theatre , with the central roles filled by Alex Jennings as Britten and Richard Griffiths as Auden ( the latter replacing Michael Gambon , who had to withdraw from the production due to minor ill health ) . The performance of April 22 , 2010 was broadcast to more than 200 cinemas worldwide by [ http : //www.ntlive.com NTLive ] .   Synopsis   `` The Habit of Art '' centres on Fitz , Henry , Tim and Donald , who are actors rehearsing a play called Caliban 's Day .

Auden has hired a rent boy , Stuart ( Tim ) and when Humphrey Carpenter ( Donald ) - who will write biographies of both Auden and Britten after their deaths - arrives to interview him , Auden mistakes him for Stuart . Britten has been auditioning boys for Death in Venice nearby , and arrives unexpectedly ( their first meeting in 25 years after they fell out over the failure of their opera Paul Bunyan ) . He wants to discuss his misgivings about the paedophilic theme of Death in Venice and the light that may cast on his own life , but Auden assumes Britten wants him to write the libretto .   The characters intermittently break out of the rehearsal to discuss the play , how accurately/harshly it should treat Auden 's failings , the actor 's craft and many other issues raised by Auden , Britten and the play . In doing so , they reveal something of their own backgrounds ."], [45, "The Kingdom of England was a sovereign state on the island of Great Britain from the 10th century—when it emerged from various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms—until 1707 , when it united with Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain .   In the early 11th century the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms , united by Æthelstan ( r. 927–939 ) , became part of the North Sea Empire of Cnut the Great , a personal union between England , Denmark and Norway . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 led to the transfer of the English capital city and chief royal residence from the Anglo-Saxon one at Winchester to Westminster , and the City of London quickly established itself as England 's largest and principal commercial centre .   Histories of the kingdom of England from the Norman conquest of 1066 conventionally distinguish periods named after successive ruling dynasties : Norman 1066–1154 , Plantagenet 1154–1485 , Tudor 1485–1603 and Stuart 1603–1714 ( interrupted by the Interregnum of 1649–1660 ) .  Dynastically , all English monarchs after 1066 ultimately claim descent from the Normans ; the distinction of the Plantagenets is merely conventional , beginning with Henry II ( reigned 1154-1189 ) as from that time , the Angevin kings became `` more English in nature '' ; the houses of Lancaster and York are both Plantagenet cadet branches , the Tudor dynasty claimed descent from Edward III via John Beaufort and James VI and I of the House of Stuart claimed descent from Henry VII via Margaret Tudor .   The completion of the conquest of Wales by Edward I in 1284 put Wales under the control of the English crown . Edward III ( reigned 1327–1377 ) transformed the Kingdom of England into one of the most formidable military powers in Europe ; his reign also saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular the evolution of the English parliament . From the 1340s the kings of England also laid claim to the crown of France , but after the Hundred Years ' War and the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in 1455 , the English were no longer in any position to pursue their French claims and lost all their land on the continent , except for Calais . After the turmoils of the Wars of the Roses , the Tudor dynasty ruled during the English Renaissance and again extended English monarchical power beyond England proper , achieving the full union of England and the Principality of Wales in 1542 . Henry VIII oversaw the English Reformation , and his daughter Elizabeth I ( reigned 1558–1603 ) the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , meanwhile establishing England as a great power and laying the foundations of the British Empire by claiming possessions in the New World .   From the accession of James I in 1603 , the Stuart dynasty ruled England in personal union with Scotland and Ireland . Under the Stuarts , the kingdom plunged into civil war , which culminated in the execution of Charles I in 1649 . The monarchy returned in 1660 , but the Civil War established the precedent that an English monarch can not govern without the consent of Parliament , although this concept became legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 .  From this time the kingdom of England , as well as its successor state the United Kingdom , functioned in effect as a constitutional monarchy.The Constitution of the United Kingdom , with the reservation that it is `` uncodified '' , is taken to be based in the Bill of Rights 1689 . On 1 May 1707 , under the terms of the Acts of Union 1707 , the kingdoms of England and Scotland united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain .   Name   The Anglo-Saxons referred to themselves as the Engle or the Angelcynn , originally names of the Angles . They called their land Engla land , meaning `` land of the English '' ,  by Æthelweard Latinized Anglia , from an original Anglia vetus , the purported homeland of the Angles ( called Angulus by Bede ) . The name Engla land became England by haplology during the Middle English period ( Engle-land , Engelond ) . The Latin name was Anglia or Anglorum terra , the Old French and Anglo-Norman one Angleterre . By the 14th century , England was also used in reference to the entire island of Great Britain .

It borders Greater London to the north west , Surrey to the west , East Sussex to the south west , and across the Thames Estuary is the county of Essex . The county town is Maidstone . With a population of over 1.4 million , Kent is the second most populous county in the South East region after Hampshire .   Canterbury Cathedral in Kent has been the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury , leader of the Church of England , since the conversion of England to Christianity by Saint Augustine in the 6th century .   Between London and the Strait of Dover , which separates it from mainland Europe , Kent has seen both diplomacy and conflict , ranging from the Leeds Castle peace talks of 1978 and 2004 to the Battle of Britain in World War II .   England relied on the county 's ports to provide warships through much of its history ; the Cinque Ports in the 12th–14th centuries and Chatham Dockyard in the 16th–20th centuries were of particular importance . France can be seen clearly in fine weather from Folkestone and the White Cliffs of Dover . Hills in the form of the North Downs and the Greensand Ridge span the length of the county and in the series of valleys in between and to the south are most of the county 's 26 castles .   Because of its relative abundance of fruit-growing and hop gardens , Kent is known as `` The Garden of England '' .

Kent 's economy is greatly diversified . Haulage , logistics and tourism are major industries throughout the county ; major industries in north-west Kent include aggregate building materials , printing and scientific research . Coal mining has also played its part in Kent 's industrial heritage . Large parts of Kent are within the London commuter belt and its strong transport connections to the capital and the nearby continent makes Kent a high income county . Twenty-eight per cent of the county forms part of two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty : the North Downs and The Weald .   History   The area has been occupied since the Palaeolithic era , as attested by finds from the quarries at Swanscombe . The Medway megaliths were built during the Neolithic era . There is a rich sequence of Bronze Age , Iron Age , and Roman era occupation , as indicated by finds and features such as the Ringlemere gold cup and the Roman villas of the Darent valley .   The modern name of Kent is derived from the Brythonic word Cantus meaning `` rim '' or `` border '' . This describes the eastern part of the current county area as a border land or coastal district . Julius Caesar had described the area as Cantium , or home of the Cantiaci in 51 BC . The extreme west of the modern county was by the time of Roman Britain occupied by Iron Age tribes , known as the Regnenses .   East Kent became a kingdom of the Jutes during the 5th century and was known as Cantia from about 730 and recorded as Cent in 835 . The early medieval inhabitants of the county were known as the Cantwara , or Kent people . These people regarded the city of Canterbury as their capital .   In 597 , Pope Gregory I appointed the religious missionary ( who became Saint Augustine of Canterbury after his death ) as the first Archbishop of Canterbury . In the previous year , Augustine successfully converted the pagan King Æthelberht of Kent to Christianity . The Diocese of Canterbury became Britain 's first Episcopal See with first cathedral and has since remained Britain 's centre of Christianity . The second designated English cathedral was in Kent at Rochester Cathedral .   In the 11th century , the people of Kent adopted the motto Invicta , meaning `` undefeated '' . This naming followed the invasion of Britain by William of Normandy . The Kent people 's continued resistance against the Normans led to Kent 's designation as a semi-autonomous county"], [47, "A hangover is the experience of various unpleasant physiological and psychological effects following the consumption of ethanol , as found in wine , beer and distilled spirits . Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than 24 hours . Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache , drowsiness , concentration problems , dry mouth , dizziness , fatigue , gastrointestinal distress ( e.g. , vomiting ) , absence of hunger , sweating , nausea , hyper-excitability and anxiety .   While the causes of a hangover are still poorly understood , several factors are known to be involved including acetaldehyde accumulation , changes in the immune system and glucose metabolism , dehydration , metabolic acidosis , disturbed prostaglandin synthesis , increased cardiac output , vasodilation , sleep deprivation and malnutrition . Beverage-specific effects of additives or by-products such as congeners in alcoholic beverages also play an important role . The symptoms occur typically after the intoxicating effect of the alcohol begins to wear off , generally the morning after a night of heavy drinking .   Though many possible remedies and `` folk cures '' have been suggested , there is no compelling evidence to suggest that any are effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover . Avoiding alcohol or drinking in moderation are the most effective ways to avoid a hangover .  The socioeconomic consequences and health risks of alcohol hangover include workplace absenteeism , impaired job performance , reduced productivity and poor academic achievement . A hangover may also compromise potentially dangerous daily activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery .   Signs and symptoms   An alcohol hangover is associated with a variety of symptoms that may include drowsiness , headache , concentration problems , dry mouth , dizziness , gastrointestinal complaints , fatigue , sweating , nausea , hyper-excitability , anxiety and a feeling of general discomfort that may last more than 24 hours . Alcohol hangover symptoms develop when blood alcohol concentration falls considerably and peak when it returns to almost zero . Hangover symptoms validated in controlled studies include general malaise , thirst , headache , feeling dizzy or faint , tiredness , loss of appetite , nausea , stomach ache , and feeling as though one ’ s heart is racing . Some symptoms such as changes in sleep pattern and gastrointestinal distress are attributed to direct effects of the alcohol intoxication , or withdrawal symptoms . Drowsiness and impaired cognitive function are the two dominant features of alcohol hangover .   Causes   The processes which lead to hangovers are still poorly understood . Several pathophysiological changes may give rise to the alcohol hangover including increased levels of acetaldehyde , hormonal alterations of the cytokine pathways and decrease of the availability of glucose . Additional associated phenomena are dehydration , metabolic acidosis , disturbed prostaglandin synthesis , increased cardiac output , vasodilation , sleep deprivation and insufficient eating . Some complex organic molecules found in alcoholic beverages known as congeners may play an important role in producing hangover effects because some , such as methanol , are metabolized to the notably toxic substances formaldehyde and formic acid .   Pathophysiology   After being ingested , ethanol is first converted to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and then to acetic acid by oxidation process . These reactions also convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD+ ) to its reduced form NADH in a redox reaction . By causing an imbalance of the NAD+/NADH redox system , alcoholic beverages make normal bodily functions more difficult . Consequences of the alcohol induced redox changes in the human body include increased triglyceride production , increased amino acid catabolism , inhibition of the citric acid cycle , lactic acidosis , ketoacidosis , hyperuricemia , disturbance in cortisol and androgen metabolism and increased fibrogenesis.The metabolism of glucose and insulin are also influenced . However , recent studies showed no significant correlation between hangover severity and the concentrations of various hormones , electrolytes , free fatty acids , triglycerides , lactate , ketone bodies , cortisol , and glucose in blood and urine samples .   Alcohol also induces the CYP2E1 enzyme , which metabolizes ethanol and other substances into more reactive toxins . In particular , in binge drinking the enzyme is activated and plays a role in creating a harmful condition known as oxidative stress which can lead to cell death .   Acetaldehyde   Acetaldehyde , the first by-product of ethanol , is between 10 and 30 times more toxic than alcohol itself and can remain at an elevated plateau for many hours after initial ethanol consumption . In addition , certain genetic factors can amplify the negative"], [48, "Fashion is a popular style or practice , especially in clothing , footwear , accessories , makeup , body , or furniture . Fashion is a distinctive and often  constant trend in the style in which a person dresses . It is the prevailing styles in behaviour and the newest creations of textile designers . Because the more technical term costume is regularly linked to the term `` fashion '' , the use of the former has been relegated to special senses like fancy dress or masquerade wear , while `` fashion '' generally means clothing , including the study of it . Although aspects of fashion can be feminine or masculine , some trends are androgynous .   Clothing fashions   Early Western travelers , whether to Persia , Turkey , India , China , would frequently remark on the absence of change in fashion there . The Japanese Shogun 's secretary bragged ( not completely accurately ) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years . However , there is considerable evidence in Ming China of rapidly changing fashions in Chinese clothing . Changes in costume often took place at times of economic or social change , as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate , followed by a long period without major changes . In 8th-century Moorish Spain , the musician Ziryab introduced to Córdoba sophisticated clothing-styles based on seasonal and daily fashions from his native Baghdad , modified by his own inspiration . Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 11th century in the Middle East following the arrival of the Turks , who introduced clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East .   The beginning in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated . Historians , including James Laver and Fernand Braudel , date the start of Western fashion in clothing to the middle of the 14th century . The most dramatic early change in fashion was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment from calf-length to barely covering the buttocks , sometimes accompanied with stuffing in the chest to make it look bigger . This created the distinctive Western outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers .   The pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century , and women and men 's fashion , especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair , became equally complex . Art historians are therefore able to use fashion with confidence and precision to date images , often to within five years , particularly in the case of images from the 15th century . Initially , changes in fashion led to a fragmentation across the upper classes of Europe of what had previously been a very similar style of dressing and the subsequent development of distinctive national styles . These national styles remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again , mostly originating from Ancien Régime France . Though the rich usually led fashion , the increasing affluence of early modern Europe led to the bourgeoisie and even peasants following trends at a distance , but still uncomfortably close for the elites – a factor that Fernand Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion .   In the 16th century , national differences were at their most pronounced . Ten 16th century portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats . Albrecht Dürer illustrated the differences in his actual ( or composite ) contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century ( illustration , right ) . The `` Spanish style '' of the late 16th century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans , and after a struggle in the mid-17th century , French styles decisively took over leadership , a process completed in the 18th century .   Though textile colors and patterns changed from year to year , the cut of a gentleman 's coat and the length of his waistcoat , or the pattern to which a lady 's dress was cut , changed more slowly . Men 's fashions were largely derived from military models , and changes in a European male Silhouette were galvanized in theaters of European war where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of foreign styles such as the `` Steinkirk '' cravat or necktie .   Though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France since the 16th century and Abraham Bosse had produced engravings of fashion in the 1620s , the pace of change"], [49, "The UK Singles Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom . Before 2004 , the chart was only based on the sales of physical singles with airplay figures and digital downloads excluded from the official chart . This list shows singles that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart during 1994 , as well as songs which peaked in 1993 and 1995 but were in the top 10 in 1994 . The entry date is when the song appeared in the top 10 for the first time .   131 singles were in the top ten in 1994 . American singer Mariah Carey , East 17 and British boy-band Take That all had three top ten entries in 1994 . Carey 's cover of the Badfinger song `` Without You '' was her biggest hit of the year ; it reached number-one in February and spent four weeks in that position , and eight weeks in the top 10 in total . Her other top ten singles were `` All I Want for Christmas Is You '' ( number 2 ) in December ; `` Endless Love '' ( 4 ) with Luther Vandross in September ; and `` Anytime You Need a Friend '' ( 8 ) in June . Three of Take That 's four top ten singles reached number-one in the UK : `` Babe '' in December 1993 , `` Everything Changes '' in April and `` Sure '' in October . `` Love Ai n't Here Anymore '' was their other top 10 entry , which reached number 3 in July . East 17 also had a number-one single in 1994 , `` Stay Another Day '' , which stayed there for 5 of its 8 weeks in the top ten . Their other top ten singles were `` Around the World '' and `` It 's Alright ( both number 3 ) and `` Steam '' ( number 7 ) . Bon Jovi , Oasis and Eternal had three singles in the top ten in 1994 .   Wet Wet Wet had the biggest-selling single of 1994 with `` Love Is All Around '' , which spent 15 weeks at number-one in the UK , a total of 20 weeks in the top 10 , and sold 1.783 million copies . Whigfield 's `` Saturday Night '' finished in second place , and `` Stay Another Day '' was the third best-selling single .

The first category of acids is the proton donors or Brønsted acids . In the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion H3O+ and are known as Arrhenius acids . Brønsted and Lowry generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents . A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H+ .   Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid . Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . The word acid is derived from the Latin acidus/acēre meaning sour . An aqueous solution of an acid has a pH less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid ' ( as in 'dissolved in acid ' ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . A lower pH means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic .   Common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . As these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial sense ) can be solutions or pure substances , and can be derived from acids ( in the strict sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid .   The second category of acids are Lewis acids , which form a covalent bond with an electron pair . An example is boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( NH3 ) . Lewis considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( H+ ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs . However , hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other Brønsted-Lowry acids can not form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids . Conversely , many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry acids . In modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as a Lewis acid .   Definitions and concepts   Modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids .   Most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions , or can be dissolved in water , so the Arrhenius and Brønsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant .   The Brønsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton ( H+ ) from an acid to a base .   Hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions . Interestingly , although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids , they can also function as Lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms .   Arrhenius acids   The Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions ( H+ ) or protons in 1884 . An Arrhenius acid is a substance that , when added to water , increases the concentration of H+ ions in the water . Note that chemists often write H+ ( aq ) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus , a proton , does not exist alone in water , it exists as the hydronium ion , H3O+ . Thus , an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium"], [51, "Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- to late 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic , danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music , jazz , and rhythm and blues ( R & B ) . Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground . Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord , distinguishing them from R & B and soul songs , which are built on complex chord progressions . Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz , such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths , or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths .   Like much African-inspired music , funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments such as electric guitar , electric bass , Hammond organ , and drums playing interlocking rhythms . Funk bands sometimes have a horn section of several saxophones , trumpets , and in some cases , a trombone , which plays rhythmic `` hits '' and `` punches '' . Funk originated in the mid-1960s , with James Brown 's development of a signature groove that emphasized the downbeat—with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure , funky bass lines , drum patterns , and syncopated guitar riffs . Other musical groups , including Sly & the Family Stone and Parliament-Funkadelic , soon began to adopt and develop Brown 's innovations . While much of the written history of funk focuses on men , there have been notable funk women , including Chaka Khan , Labelle , Brides of Funkenstein , Klymaxx , Mother 's Finest , and Betty Davis .   Many of the most famous bands in the genre also played disco and soul extensively . Funk derivatives include funk rock ( e.g. , Red Hot Chili Peppers ) ; boogie ( or electro-funk ) , a form of electronic music ; electro music , a hybrid of electronic music and funk ; funk metal ( e.g. , Living Colour ) ; G-funk , a mix of gangsta rap and funk ; Timba , a form of funky Cuban popular dance music ; and funk jam ( e.g. , Phish ) . Funk samples have been used extensively in genres including hip hop , house music , and drum and bass . It is also the main influence of go-go , a subgenre associated with funk .   Etymology   The word funk initially referred ( and still refers ) to a strong odor . It is originally derived from Latin `` fumigare '' ( which means `` to smoke '' ) via Old French `` fungiere '' and , in this sense , it was first documented in English in 1620 . In 1784 `` funky '' meaning `` musty '' was first documented , which , in turn , led to a sense of `` earthy '' that was taken up around 1900 in early jazz slang for something `` deeply or strongly felt '' .   In early jam sessions , musicians would encourage one another to `` get down '' by telling one another , `` Now , put some stank on it ! `` . At least as early as 1907 , jazz songs carried titles such as Funky . The first example is an unrecorded number by Buddy Bolden , remembered as either `` Funky Butt '' or `` Buddy Bolden 's Blues '' with improvised lyrics that were , according to Donald M. Marquis either `` comical and light '' or `` crude and downright obscene '' but , in one way or another , referring to the sweaty atmosphere at dances where Bolden 's band played . [ http : //www.realmusicforum.com/history/who-started-funk-music/2008122356/ Who Started Funk Music ] , Real Music Forum As late as the 1950s and early 1960s , when `` funk '' and `` funky '' were used increasingly in the context of jazz music , the terms still were considered indelicate and inappropriate for use in polite company . According to one source , New Orleans-born drummer Earl Palmer `` was the first to use the word 'funky ' to explain to other musicians that their music should be made more syncopated and danceable . `` [ http : //www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/sep/23/popandrock.usa Obituary , The Guardian ] The style later evolved into a rather hard-driving , insistent rhythm , implying a more carnal quality .

As Chancellor of the Exchequer ( 1908–1915 ) , Lloyd George was a key figure in the introduction of many reforms which laid the foundations of the modern welfare state . His most important role came as the highly energetic Prime Minister of the Wartime Coalition Government ( 1916–22 ) , during and immediately after the First World War . He was a major player at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that reordered Europe after the defeat of the Central Powers . He arguably made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader , thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain 's social welfare system , his leadership in winning the war , his post-war role in reshaping Europe , and his partitioning Ireland ( between Southern Ireland - later the Irish Free State - and Northern Ireland which remained part of the UK ) .   He was the last Liberal to serve as Prime Minister . Parliamentary support for the coalition premiership was mostly from Conservatives rather than his own Liberals . The Liberal split contributed to the long-term collapse of that party as a major political force . Although he became leader of the Liberal Party in the late 1920s , he was unable to regain power , and by the 1930s he was a marginalised and widely mistrusted figure .   He was voted the third greatest British prime minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by MORI , and in 2002 he was named among the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote .   Upbringing and early life   Lloyd George was born in Chorlton-on-Medlock , Manchester , to Welsh parents , and was brought up as a Welsh-speaker . He is so far the only British Prime Minister to have been Welsh and to have spoken English as a second language .   His father , William George , had been a teacher in both London and Liverpool . He also taught in the Hope Street Sunday Schools , which were administered by the Unitarians , where he met Unitarian minister Dr James Martineau . In March of the same year , on account of his failing health , William George returned with his family to his native Pembrokeshire . He took up farming but died in June 1864 of pneumonia , aged 44 . His widow , Elizabeth George ( 1828–96 ) , sold the farm and moved with her children to her native Llanystumdwy in Caernarfonshire , where she lived in Tŷ Newydd with her brother Richard Lloyd ( 1834–1917 ) , who was a shoemaker , a minister ( in the Scotch Baptists and then the Church of Christ ) , and a strong Liberal . Lloyd George was educated at the local Anglican school Llanystumdwy National School and later under tutors . Lloyd George 's uncle was a towering influence on him , encouraging him to take up a career in law and enter politics ; his uncle remained influential up until his death at age 83 in February 1917 , by which time his nephew had become Prime Minister . He added his uncle 's surname to become `` Lloyd George '' . His surname is usually given as `` Lloyd George '' and sometimes as `` George '' . The influence of his childhood showed through in his entire career , as he attempted to aid the common man at the expense of what he liked to call `` the Dukes '' ( that is , the aristocracy ) . However , his biographer John Grigg argued that Lloyd George 's childhood was nowhere near as poverty-stricken as he liked to suggest , and that a great deal of his self-confidence came from having been brought up by an uncle who enjoyed a position of influence and prestige in his small community .   Brought up a devout evangelical , as a young man he suddenly lost his religious faith . Biographer Don Cregier says he became `` a Deist and perhaps an agnostic , though he remained a chapel-goer and connoisseur of good preaching all his life . '' He kept quiet about that , however , and was hailed as `` one of the foremost fighting leaders of a fanatical Welsh Nonconformity '' .   It was also during this period of his life that Lloyd George first became interested in the issue of land ownership . As a young man he read books by Thomas Spence , John"], [53, "The Chablis region is the northernmost wine district of the Burgundy region in France . The cool climate of this region produces wines with more acidity and flavors less fruity than Chardonnay wines grown in warmer climates . These wines often have a `` flinty '' note , sometimes described as `` goût de pierre à fusil '' ( `` tasting of gunflint '' ) , and sometimes as `` steely '' . The Chablis Appellation d'origine contrôlée is required to use Chardonnay grapes solely .   The grapevines around the town of Chablis make a dry white wine renowned for the purity of its aroma and taste . In comparison with the white wines from the rest of Burgundy , Chablis wine has typically much less influence of oak . Most basic Chablis is unoaked , and vinified in stainless steel tanks .   The amount of barrel maturation , if any , is a stylistic choice which varies widely among Chablis producers . Many Grand Cru and Premier Cru wines receive some maturation in oak barrels , but typically the time in barrel and the proportion of new barrels is much smaller than for white wines of Côte de Beaune .   Location   Chablis lies about 10 mi east of Auxerre in the Yonne department , situated roughly halfway between the Côte d'Or and Paris . Of France 's wine-growing areas , only Champagne and Alsace have a more northerly location . Chablis is closer to the southern Aube district of Champagne than the rest of Burgundy .   The region covers 15 km x 20 km across 27 communes located along the Serein river . The soil is Kimmeridge clay with outcrops of the same chalk layer that extends from Sancerre up to the White Cliffs of Dover , giving a name to the paleontologists ' Cretaceous period . The Grand Crus , the best vineyards in the area , all lie on a single , small slope , facing southwest and located just north of the town of Chablis .   History   During the Middle Ages the Catholic Church , particularly Cistercian monks , became a major influence in establishing the economic and commercial interest of viticulture for the region . Pontigny Abbey was founded in 1114 , and the monks planted vines along the Serein . Anséric de Montréal gave a vineyard at Chablis to the Abbey in 1186 . In 1245 the chronicler Salimbene di Adam described a Chablis wine . Chardonnay is believed to have first been planted in Chablis by the Cistercians of Pontigny Abbey in the 12th century , and from there spread south to the rest of the Burgundy region .   The Chablis area became part of the Duchy of Burgundy in the 15th century . There are records in the mid-15th century of Chablis wine being shipped to England , Flanders and Picardy . But in February 1568 the town was razed by the Huguenots , and the region did not really recover until the 18th century . Then came the ravages of the French Revolution , the Little Ice Age and Prussian invasions . Just as the vineyards were being built back up , they were hit first by oidium in the 1880s , and then by the phylloxera epidemic . Following two World Wars , the Chablis wine industry would n't recover until the second half of the 20th century .   The easily accessible Seine river , via the nearby Yonne river , gave the Chablis wine producers a near monopoly on the lucrative Parisian market . In the 17th century , the English discovered the wine and began importing large volumes . By the 19th century there were nearly 98840 acre of vines planted in Chablis with vineyards stretching from the town of Chablis to Joigny and Sens along the Yonne . Chablis wines were seen across northern France with even some Champagne producers using Chablis as part of a base wine for their sparkling cuvee . The 19th-century Russian novel Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy mentions `` classic Chablis '' in a commonplace way .   The end of the 19th century saw of a period of calamity for the region beginning first with the opening of the development of railway systems that linked all parts of the country with Paris in the 1850s . This brought an influx of available inexpensive wine from regions in the Midi ( such as the Languedoc ) that undercut Chablis ' presence in the Parisian market . The 1880s saw the dual devastation of powdery mildew and phylloxera which ravaged vineyards . Many Chablis producers gave up winemaking , the acreage in the region"], [54, "Alfred `` Fred '' Zinnemann ( April 29 , 1907 - March 14 , 1997 ) was an Austrian-born American film director . He won four Academy Awards for directing films in various genres , including thrillers , westerns , film noir and play adaptations . He made 25 feature films during his 50-year career .   He was among the first directors to insist on using authentic locations and for mixing stars with civilians to give his films more realism . Within the film industry , he was considered a maverick for taking risks and thereby creating unique films , with many of his stories being dramas about lone and principled individuals tested by tragic events . According to one historian , Zinnemann 's style demonstrated his sense of `` psychological realism and his apparent determination to make worthwhile pictures that are nevertheless highly entertaining . ''   Some of his most notable films were The Men ( 1950 ) , High Noon ( 1952 ) , From Here to Eternity ( 1953 ) , Oklahoma ! ( 1955 ) , The Nun 's Story ( 1959 ) , A Man For All Seasons ( 1966 ) , The Day of the Jackal ( 1973 ) , and Julia ( 1973 ) . His films have received 65 Oscar nominations , winning 24 .   Zinnemann directed and introduced a number of stars in their U.S. film debuts , including Marlon Brando , Rod Steiger , Pier Angeli , Julie Harris , Brandon deWilde , Montgomery Clift , Shirley Jones and Meryl Streep . He directed 19 actors to Oscar nominations , including Frank Sinatra , Montgomery Clift , Audrey Hepburn , Glynis Johns , Paul Scofield , Robert Shaw , Wendy Hiller , Jason Robards , Vanessa Redgrave , Jane Fonda , Gary Cooper and Maximilian Schell .   Early life   Zinnemann was born in Rzeszów , Poland ( then part of Austria-Hungary ) , the son of Anna ( Feiwel ) and Oskar Zinnemann , a doctor . His family was Jewish , and he had one younger brother . While growing up in Austria , he wanted to become a musician , but went on to graduate with a law degree from the University of Vienna in 1927 .   While studying law , he became drawn to films and convinced his parents to let him study film production in Paris . After studying for a year at the Ecole Technique de Photographie et Cinématographie in Paris , he became a cameraman and found work on a number of films in Berlin , before emigrating to Hollywood . Both of his parents were killed during the Holocaust .   Career as director   Early career   Zinnemann worked in Germany with several other beginners ( Billy Wilder and Robert Siodmak also worked with him on the 1929 feature People on Sunday ) after he studied filmmaking in France . His penchant for realism and authenticity is evident in his first feature The Wave ( 1935 ) , shot on location in Mexico with mostly non-professional actors recruited among the locals , which is one of the earliest examples of social realism in narrative film . Earlier in the decade , in fact , Zinnemann had worked with documentarian Robert Flaherty , `` probably the greatest single influence on my work as a filmmaker '' , he said .   Although he was fascinated by the arts culture in Germany , with its theater , music and films , he was also aware that the country was in a deep economic crisis . He became disenchanted with Berlin after continually seeing decadent ostentation and luxury existing alongside desperate unemployment . The wealthy classes were moving more to the political right and the poor to the left . `` Emotion had long since begun to displace reason , '' he said . As a result of the changing political climate , along with the fact that sound films had arrived in Europe , which was technically unprepared to produce their own , film production throughout Europe slowed dramatically . Zinnemann , then only 21 , got his parent 's permission to go to America where he hoped filmmaking opportunities would be greater .   He arrived in New York at the end of October , 1929 , at the time of the stock market crash . Despite the financial panic then beginning , he found New York to be a different cultural environment :   He took a Greyhound bus to Hollywood a few months later following the completion of his first directorial effort for the Mexican cultural protest film , The Wave , in"], [55, "Graham McPherson ( born 13 January 1961 ) , better known as Suggs , is an English singer-songwriter , musician , radio personality and actor . In a career spanning more than 30 years , Suggs came to prominence in the late 1970s as the lead singer for the English ska band Madness , which released fifteen singles that entered the top ten charts in the United Kingdom during the 1970s , 1980s and the 1990s , including `` My Girl '' , `` Baggy Trousers '' , `` Embarrassment '' , `` It Must Be Love '' , `` House of Fun '' , `` Driving in My Car '' , `` Our House '' , `` Wings of a Dove '' and `` Lovestruck '' . Suggs began his solo career in 1995 , while still a member of Madness . Since then , he has released two studio albums , and two compilation albums . His solo hits include `` I 'm Only Sleeping '' , `` Camden Town '' , `` Cecilia '' , and `` Blue Day '' .   Suggs has also been an actor , with roles in films , theatre and television . He has married once and is the father of two children .   Early life   Graham McPherson was born on 13 January 1961 , in Hastings , Sussex , England , the son of William Rutherford McPherson ( 1935–1975 ) and jazz singer Edith Gower . The couple married in Paddington in 1960 , and Suggs was raised in Hastings by his mother . His father had left by the time Suggs was aged three . In a 2009 interview when asked about what happened to his father :   I do n't know , but what I 've heard has n't been good : heroin , injecting his eyeballs with paraffin , being sectioned . He must be dead now . I mean , he would have got in touch if he was alive , would n't he ? Yeah , he must be dead , poor bugger .   Suggs spent three years of his childhood in Haverfordwest , in Pembrokeshire , and had just started at a grammar school when his mother moved to North London . He then went to a comprehensive school at Quintin Kynaston , Swiss Cottage , North London . On the official Madness website , he has stated :   I was born in Hastings on a stormy evening on 13 January 1961 . I only lived with my mum , so we were free agents . She was a singer in the pubs and clubs . We moved to Liverpool then London . I lived with relations in Wales for a while and came back to London . Because I was an only child , I was pretty insular and stubborn . All the upheaval made me lazy academically , so by the time I got to Quintin Kynaston school in St John 's Wood I did n't bother much , I stayed onto the [ eir ] sixth form for social security reasons , and got two O-levels and a CSE on the way . I met Mike Barson hanging around Hampstead School .   Suggs got his nickname from randomly sticking a pin in an encyclopaedia of jazz musicians ( hitting Peter Suggs ) while he was still in school , to avoid being labelled as the member of an ethnic minority owing to his Scottish name . To capitalise on the name he went as far as to create a myth about it , writing lines like `` Suggs is our leader '' on the walls and only answering to that name .   After leaving school at age 15 he worked at a butcher 's for eight months , his first proper job . The first gig he went to was the Who supported by the Sensational Alex Harvey Band in 1976 .   Career   In 1976 Mike Barson , Chris Foreman and Lee Thompson formed the North London Invaders , which later became the band Madness . The original members recruited were John Hasler , Cathal Smyth and vocalist Dikron Tulane . This six-piece line-up was stable until 1977 , when Suggs took over the lead vocals and Tulane left the band . After a decline in hits , the band broke-up in 1986 .   Solo career   After Madness ' reformation for Madstock ! in 1992 and 1994 , Suggs went to work on his first solo album with the production help of reggae producers Sly and Robbie . In 1995 The Lone Ranger was released on Warner Music"], [56, 'The radish ( Raphanus sativus ) is an edible root vegetable of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times . Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world , being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable . They have numerous varieties , varying in size , flavor , color , and length of time they take to mature . Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants , including glucosinolate , myrosinase , and isothiocyanate . They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases . They germinate quickly and grow rapidly , smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month , while larger daikon varieties take several months . Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop . Some radishes are grown for their seeds ; daikon , for instance , may be grown for oil production . Others are used for sprouting and both roots and leaves are sometimes served cooked or cold .   History   Varieties of radish are now broadly distributed around the world , but almost no archeological records are available to help determine their early history and domestication . However , scientists tentatively locate the origin of Raphanus sativus in southeast Asia , as this is the only region where truly wild forms have been discovered . India , central China , and central Asia appear to have been secondary centers where differing forms were developed . Radishes enter the historical record in . Greek and Roman agriculturalists of the gave details of small , large , round , long , mild , and sharp varieties . The radish seems to have been one of the first European crops introduced to the Americas . A German botanist reported radishes of 100 lb and roughly 3 ft in length in 1544 , although the only variety of that size today is the Japanese Sakurajima radish . The large , mild , and white East Asian form was developed in China , but is mostly associated in the West with the Japanese daikon , owing to Japanese agricultural development and larger exports .   Description   Radishes are annual or biennial brassicaceous crops grown for their swollen tap roots which can be globular , tapering , or cylindrical . The root skin colour ranges from white through pink , red , purple , yellow , and green to black , but the flesh is usually white . Smaller types have a few leaves about 13 cm long with round roots up to in diameter or more slender , long roots up to 7 cm long . Both of these are normally eaten raw in salads . A longer root form , including oriental radishes , daikon or mooli , and winter radishes , grows up to 60 cm long with foliage about 60 cm high with a spread of 45 cm . The flesh of radishes harvested timely is crisp and sweet , but becomes bitter and tough if the vegetable is left in the ground too long . Leaves are arranged in a rosette . They have a lyrate shape , meaning they are divided pinnately with an enlarged terminal lobe and smaller lateral lobes . The white flowers are borne on a racemose inflorescence . The fruits are small pods which can be eaten when young .   The radish is a diploid species , and has 18 chromosomes ( 2n=18 ) .   Cultivation   Radishes are a fast-growing , annual , cool-season crop . The seed germinates in three to four days in moist conditions with soil temperatures between 65 and . Best quality roots are obtained under moderate day lengths with air temperatures in the range 50 to . Under average conditions , the crop matures in 3–4 weeks , but in colder weather , 6–7 weeks may be required .   Radishes grow best in full sun in light , sandy loams , with a soil pH 6.5 to 7.0 , but for late-season crops , a clayey-loam is ideal . Soils that bake dry and form a crust in dry weather are unsuitable and can impair germination . Harvesting periods can be extended by making repeat plantings , spaced a week or two apart . In warmer climates , radishes are normally planted in the autumn . The depth at which seeds are planted affects the size of the root , from 1 cm deep recommended for small radishes to 4 cm for large radishes . During the growing period , the crop needs to be thinned and weeds controlled , and irrigation'], [57, "The Recreation Ground ( commonly the Rec ) is a large open space in the centre of Bath , England , next to the River Avon , which is available to be used by permission from the Recreation Ground Trust for recreational purposes by the public at large but particularly the people of Bath and surrounding areas . [ http : //web.archive.org/web/20071202080421/http : //www.charitycommission.gov.uk/investigations/inquiryreports/bath.asp The Recreation Ground , Bath - a statement under the Charities Act ] , Charity Commission , 22/8/2007   About a quarter of the Rec is leased to Bath Rugby during the rugby union season as a sports ground capable of holding 13,500 people . During the summer the rugby ground 's temporary East Stand is removed to make way for cricket on a larger pitch . This cricket pitch is used for local contests and was used by Somerset County Cricket Club until 2011 . [ http : //www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/303.html Cricket Archive ] Recreation Ground , Bath Parts of the eastern area of the Rec are used by Bath Hockey Club , Bath Croquet Club , Bath Drama Club and for some tennis courts . Pitches are available for amateur sports such as Football , Volleyball and Lacrosse . There is a cricket pavilion at the William Street entrance to the ground . The council-run Sports and Leisure Centre is located on the southern edge of the Rec , accessed via North Parade .   In former years the Rec was subject to periodic flooding from the River Avon , but a flood alleviation scheme in the 1960s improved the flow of the river . However , the Rec remains part of the floodplain at risk of occasional flooding . The ground can still get very boggy after heavy rains .   History   In the early part of the 1890s , the land on which the Recreation Ground now lies as well as the North Parade land were part of the Bathwick Estate , which was owned by the Forester family . In 1894 , a lease was granted to the Directors of The Bath and County Recreation Ground Company Limited by Captain G W Forester . This lease allowed work to be carried out on the land which would make it suitable for cricket matches , lawn tennis and archery tournaments , football matches and all other outdoor sports . As part of this work , a cricket pavilion was started on the north side of the ground . The first Bath rugby matches were also played on the ground in 1884 . Three years later , the ground hosted its maiden first-class cricket match , with Somerset County Cricket Club hosting the Gentlemen of Philadelphia as part of the Bath Cricket Festival . The company 's lease was extended for a further 21 years in 1908 , at a rent of £100 per year . Fourteen years later , the land was conveyed to The Bath and County Recreation Ground Company Limited for £6,050 . The company then conveyed the North Parade Land , including a building which was used as an ice skating rink , to Bath Artcraft Limited for £2,500 .   A new lease was granted to Bath F.C . in 1927 , allowing them the use of the land on the west side of ground , along with a Grand Stand , a New ( North ) Stand and a Pavilion , for a term of 25 years . Six years later the lease was surrendered , and a new 50-year lease was granted . In the same year , the Grand Stand was replaced with a new West Stand . This was significantly bomb-damaged during the Second World War . Rebuilding of the stand , at a cost in excess of £12,000 , was met by the War Damage Commission in 1953–54 . The 'Club Room ' building was erected in 1954 , to the west of the North Stand , and during the same year a lease was granted to allow a tennis club to use the north east corner of the ground . In 1956 , the ground was conveyed to the Mayor Aldermen and the Citizens of the City of Bath ( the Corporation ) for £11,155 .   Bath F.C . surrendered their 1933 lease , and were granted a new 75-year lease in 1973 . In 1974 , both the Recreation Ground and the North Parade Land were transferred to Bath City Council , who erected a Sports and Leisure Centre on the south side in 1975 . In 1995 , Bath F.C . were granted a further 75-year lease . Doubts over the legal effect of the 1956 Conveyance were settled in 2002 , when the"], [58, "Crossbreed dogs or designer dogs are dogs which have been intentionally bred from two or more recognized dog breeds and not from dogs with no purebred ancestors , but have not been artificially bred to each other enough to breed true and be recognized as a breed in their own right .   Designer dogs   The Encyclopædia Britannica traces the term `` designer dog '' to the late 20th century , when breeders began to cross purebred poodles with other purebred breeds in order to obtain a dog with the poodles ' hypoallergenic coat , along with various desirable characteristics from other breeds .   The primary identifying mark of a crossbred `` designer dog ' is that the resulting puppies are called by a portmanteau word made up of syllables ( or sounds ) from the breed names of the two purebred parents , such as Schnoodle ( Schnauzer and poodle cross ) . Other purebred breeds are being crossed to provide designer dogs described with an endless range of created labels , such as the Puggle ( Pug and Beagle cross ) . There are even complex crosses ( with multiple breeds in recent ancestry ) being labeled in this manner , such as German Chusky ( German Shepherd Dog , Husky , Chow Chow ) .   Like children in a family , a percentage of designer dogs with the same breed ancestry will look similar to each other , even though crossbreeding does not result in as uniform a phenotype as the breeding of purebreds . Often even pups in the same litter will look quite different .   Another defining characteristic of designer dogs is that they are usually bred as companions and pets . Working and hunting dogs deliberately crossbred for a particular working purpose are not generally given portmanteau names ; they are most often referred to by a type ( not breed ) name , such as Eurohounds ( racing sled dogs ) or Lurchers ( hunting dogs ) . These dogs could be considered only as cross breeds , not as designer animals , since appearance is not the main reason for them to be bred . An exception to this is the Labradoodle , which although having a Portmanteau name , is often used as a Guide or Assistance dog as well as being popular family dogs .   Although designer dogs are often selected by owners for their novelty , reputable breeders sometimes use crossbreeding in an attempt to reduce the incidence of certain hereditary problems found in the purebred breeds , while retaining their more appealing traits . Jon Mooallem in The New York Times writes , `` Given the roughly 350 inherited disorders littering the dog genome , crossing two purebreds and expanding their gene pools can be ' a phenomenally good idea , ' according to one canine geneticist—if it is done conscientiously . '' crossbreeding has not been well studied in dogs , although it has been for livestock . The heritability of the desired trait being bred for ( such as a hypoallergenic coat ) needs to be known ; `` Heritability is the proportion of the measurable difference observed between animals for a given trait that is due to genetics ( and can be passed to the next generation ) . '' In addition , the goals of dog crossbreeding may be harder to define than the goals of livestock crossbreeding ; good temperament may be harder to define and measure than high calf weight .   Designer dog breeders are often criticised for being more interested in profitable puppy production than in dog health and welfare . Wally Conron comments on the popularity of crosses after his introduction of the Labradoodle : `` Were breeders bothering to check their sires and bitches for heredity faults , or were they simply caught up in delivering to hungry customers the next status symbol ? '' Designer dog puppies sometimes bring higher prices than the purebreds from which they are bred .   The fanciers of designer dogs respond that all modern dog breeds were created from earlier breeds and types of dogs through the same kind of selective breeding that is used to create designer dogs . The Toy Poodle was bred down in size from larger poodles , most likely by crossing with various very small Bichon types , such as the Maltese and Havanese . Most of the modern breeds have ancestries that include various older dog types and breeds ; see individual breed articles for details of the origin of each breed .   Health of crossbred dog depends on their being descended from healthy parents .

( 39 Geo . III , c. 81 ) titled An Act to prevent Unlawful Combinations of Workmen , prohibited trade unions and collective bargaining by British workers . The Act received royal assent on 12 July 1799 . An additional Act was passed in 1800 ( 39 & 40 Geo III c. 106 ) .   Background   The 1799 and 1800 acts were passed under the government of William Pitt the Younger as a response to Jacobin activity and the fear that workers would strike during a conflict to force the government to accede to their demands . Collectively these acts were known as the Combination Laws .   Significance   The legislation drove labour organisations underground . Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824 . Lobbying by the radical tailor Francis Place played a role in this . However , in response to the series of strikes that followed , the Combinations of Workmen Act 1825 was passed , which allowed labour unions but severely restricted their activity .'], [61, "The Bionic Woman is an American television science fiction action series starring Lindsay Wagner that aired between 1976 and 1978 . The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers , who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers . The Bionic Woman series is a spin-off from the 1970s The Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series .   Wagner stars as professional tennis player Jaime Sommers , who becomes critically injured during a skydiving accident . Jaime 's life is saved by Oscar Goldman ( Richard Anderson ) and Dr. Rudy Wells ( Martin E. Brooks ) with bionic surgical implants similar to those of The Six Million Dollar Man Steve Austin ( Lee Majors ) . Through the use of cybernetic implants , known as bionics , Jaime is gifted with an amplified bionic ear which allows her to hear at low volumes and at different frequencies from most humans and over uncommonly long distances . She also has extraordinary strength in her bionic right arm and in both legs that enables her to run at speeds exceeding 60 miles per hour . She is then assigned to spy missions of her own as an occasional agent of the Office of Scientific Information , while under the employment cover as a school teacher of middle school students .   The series proved highly popular worldwide , gaining high ratings in the US and particularly so in the UK ( where it became the only science fiction programme to achieve the No.1 position in the ratings during the 20th century ) . The series ran for three seasons , from 1975 to 1978 , and was first shown on the ABC network and then the NBC network for its final season . Years after its cancelation , three spin-off TV movies were produced between 1987 and 1994 . Reruns of the show aired on Sci-Fi Channel from 1997 to 2001 . A remake of the series was produced in 2007 .   Premise   The character of Jaime Sommers first appears in a two-part episode of The Six Million Dollar Man in 1975 titled `` The Bionic Woman '' . In the first episode , Steve travels to his old hometown of Ojai , California , to buy a ranch that is for sale and to visit his mother and stepfather . During his visit , he rekindles his old relationship with Jaime Sommers , now one of America 's top tennis players . Their relationship progresses rapidly to the point where Steve proposes marriage .   During an outing , Steve and Jaime take part in some skydiving . Jaime 's parachute malfunctions and she plummets to the ground , falling through tree branches , hitting the ground and suffering traumatic injuries to her head , legs , and right arm . Steve then makes an emotional plea to his boss , Oscar Goldman , to save Jaime 's life by implementing bionics , even going so far as to commit Jaime to becoming an operative of the Office of Scientific Intelligence ( OSI ) . Goldman agrees to assign Dr. Rudy Wells ( played at this point in the series by Alan Oppenheimer ) and the bionics team to rebuild her .   Jaime 's body is reconstructed with parts similar to Steve 's , but the actual cost of rebuilding her is not revealed . It is said humorously in dialogue to be less than the $ 6 million it cost to rebuild Austin because the replacement parts for her were `` smaller '' ( though in Germany the show was called Die Sieben Millionen Dollar Frau , which translates as The Seven Million Dollar Woman ) . Like Steve before her , Jaime is given two bionic legs , capable of propelling her at speeds exceeding 60 mph ( having been clocked at more than 62 mph in `` Doomsday Is Tomorrow '' and outpacing a race car going 100 mph in `` Winning is Everything '' ) and jumping to and from great heights , and her right arm is replaced by a lifelike prosthetic capable of bending steel or throwing objects great distances . Whereas Austin received a bionic eye , the inner mechanism of Jaime 's right ear is replaced by a bionic device that gives her amplified hearing such that she can detect most sounds regardless of volume or frequency . These bionic implants can not be distinguished from natural body parts , except on occasions where they sustain damage and the mechanisms beneath the skin become exposed , as seen in Part 2 of the episode `` Doomsday Is Tomorrow '' , when Jaime sustained damage to her right"], [62, "Watergate was a major political scandal that occurred in the United States in the 1970s , following a break-in at the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington , D.C. and President Richard Nixon 's administration 's attempted cover-up of its involvement . When the conspiracy was discovered and investigated by the U.S. Congress , the Nixon administration 's resistance to its probes led to a constitutional crisis .   The term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration . Those activities included such `` dirty tricks '' as bugging the offices of political opponents and people of whom Nixon or his officials were suspicious . Nixon and his close aides ordered harassment of activist groups and political figures , using the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , and the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) .   The scandal led to the discovery of multiple abuses of power by the Nixon administration , articles of impeachment , and the resignation of Nixon as President of the United States on August 9 , 1974 . The scandal also resulted in the indictment of 69 people , with trials or pleas resulting in 25 being found guilty and incarcerated , many of whom were Nixon 's top administration officials .   The affair began with the arrest of five men for breaking and entering into the DNC headquarters at the Watergate complex on Saturday , June 17 , 1972 . The FBI investigated and discovered a connection between cash found on the burglars and a slush fund used by the Committee for the Re-Election of the President ( CREEP ) , the official organization of Nixon 's campaign . In July 1973 , evidence mounted against the President 's staff , including testimony provided by former staff members in an investigation conducted by the Senate Watergate Committee . The investigation revealed that President Nixon had a tape-recording system in his offices and that he had recorded many conversations .   After a protracted series of bitter court battles , the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the president was obligated to release the tapes to government investigators , and he eventually complied . These audio recordings implicated the president , revealing he had attempted to cover up activities that took place after the break-in and to use federal officials to deflect the investigation .  Facing near-certain impeachment in the House of Representatives and equally certain conviction by the Senate , Nixon resigned the presidency on August 9 , 1974 . On September 8 , 1974 , his successor , Gerald Ford , pardoned him .   The name `` Watergate '' and the suffix `` -gate '' have since become synonymous with political scandals in the United States and elsewhere .   Wiretapping of the Democratic Party 's headquarters   In January 1972 , G. Gordon Liddy , general counsel to the Committee for the Re-Election of the President ( CREEP ) , presented a campaign intelligence plan to CREEP 's Acting Chairman Jeb Stuart Magruder , Attorney General John Mitchell , and Presidential Counsel John Dean , that involved extensive illegal activities against the Democratic Party . According to Dean , this marked `` the opening scene of the worst political scandal of the twentieth century and the beginning of the end of the Nixon presidency . ''   Mitchell viewed the plan as unrealistic . Two months later , he was alleged to have approved a reduced version of the plan , to include burgling the Democratic National Committee 's ( DNC ) headquarters at the Watergate Complex in Washington , D.C.—ostensibly to photograph campaign documents and install listening devices in telephones . Liddy was nominally in charge of the operation , but has since insisted that he was duped by Dean and at least two of his subordinates . These included former CIA officers E. Howard Hunt and James McCord , then-CREEP Security Coordinator ( John Mitchell had by then resigned as Attorney General to become chairman of the CREEP ) .

In common English , they are known as the crow family , or , more technically , corvids . Over 120 species are described . The genus Corvus , including the jackdaws , crows , and ravens , makes up over a third of the entire family .   They are considered the most intelligent of the birds , and among the most intelligent of all animals , having demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests ( European magpies ) and tool-making ability ( crows , rooks ) —skills until recently regarded as solely the province of humans and a few other higher mammals . Their total brain-to-body mass ratio is equal to that of great apes and cetaceans , and only slightly lower than in humans .   They are medium to large in size , with strong feet and bills , rictal bristles , and a single moult each year ( most passerines moult twice ) . Corvids are found worldwide except for the tip of South America and the polar ice caps . The majority of the species are found in tropical South and Central America , southern Asia and Eurasia , with fewer than 10 species each in Africa and Australasia . The genus Corvus has re-entered Australia in relatively recent geological prehistory , with five species and one subspecies there .   Systematics , taxonomy , and evolution   Over the years , much disagreement has arisen on the exact evolutionary relationships of the corvid family and their relatives . What eventually seemed clear was that corvids are derived from Australasian ancestors and from there spread throughout the world . Other lineages derived from these ancestors evolved into ecologically diverse , but often Australasian groups . In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s , Sibley and Ahlquist united the corvids with other taxa in the Corvida , based on DNA-DNA hybridization . The presumed corvid relatives included currawongs , birds of paradise , whipbirds , quail-thrushes , whistlers , monarch flycatchers and drongos , shrikes , vireos , and vangas , but current research favors the theory that this grouping is partly artificial . The corvids constitute the core group of the Corvoidea , together with their closest relatives ( the birds of paradise , Australian mud-nesters and shrikes ) . They are also the core group of the Corvida , which includes the related groups , such as orioles and vireos .   Clarification of the interrelationships of the corvids has been achieved based on cladistic analysis of several DNA sequences . The jays and magpies do not constitute monophyletic lineages , but rather seem to split up into an American and Old World lineage , and an Holarctic and Oriental lineage , respectively . These are not closely related among each other . The position of the azure-winged magpie , which has always been a major enigma , is even less clear than before .

The Romani are widely known among English-speaking people by the exonym `` Gypsies '' ( or `` Gipsies '' ) , which some people consider pejorative due to its connotations of illegality and irregularity .   Romani are dispersed , with their concentrated populations in Europe especially Central , Eastern and Southern Europe including Turkey , Spain and Southern France . They originated in Northern India and arrived in Mid-West Asia , then Europe , around 1,000 years ago , either separating from the Dom people or , at least , having a similar history ; the ancestors of both the Romani and the Dom left North India sometime between the sixth and eleventh century .   Since the 19th century , some Romani have also migrated to the Americas . There are an estimated one million Roma in the United States ; and 800,000 in Brazil , most of whose ancestors emigrated in the nineteenth century from eastern Europe . Brazil also includes some Romani descended from people deported by the government of Portugal during the Inquisition in the colonial era . In migrations since the late nineteenth century , Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and to Canada .   In February 2016 , during the International Roma Conference , the Indian Minister of External Affairs stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India . The conference ended with a recommendation to the Government of India to recognise the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the Indian diaspora .   The Romani language is divided into several dialects , which add up to an estimated number of speakers larger than two million . The total number of Romani people is at least twice as large ( several times as large according to high estimates ) . Many Romani are native speakers of the language current in their country of residence , or of mixed languages combining the two ; those varieties are sometimes called Para-Romani .

In particular , it denotes the river Indus and the country around it ( commonly called Sindh ) .   Romani usage   In the Romani language , Rom is a masculine noun , meaning 'man of the Roma ethnic group ' or 'man , husband ' , with the plural Roma . The feminine of Rom in the Romani language is Romni . However , in most cases , in other languages Rom is now used for people of all genders .   Romani is the feminine adjective , while Romano is the masculine adjective . Some Romanies use Rom or Roma as an ethnic name , while others ( such as the Sinti , or the Romanichal ) do not use this term as a self-ascription for the entire ethnic group .   Sometimes , rom and romani are spelled with a double r , i.e. , rrom and rromani . In this case rr is used to represent the phoneme ( also written as ř and rh ) , which in"], [65, "A cruise ship or cruise liner is a passenger ship used for pleasure voyages , where the voyage itself and the ship 's amenities are a part of the experience , as well as the different destinations , i.e. , ports of call , along the way . Transportation is not the only purpose of cruising , particularly on cruises that return passengers to their originating port , with the ports of call usually in a specified region of a continent . There are even `` cruises to nowhere '' or `` nowhere voyages '' where the ship makes 2–3 night round trips without any ports of call .   By contrast , dedicated transport oriented ocean liners do `` line voyages '' and typically transport passengers from one point to another , rather than on round trips . Traditionally , an ocean liner for the transoceanic trade will be built to a higher standard than a typical cruise ship , including high freeboard and stronger plating to withstand rough seas and adverse conditions encountered in the open ocean , such as the North Atlantic . Ocean liners also usually have larger capacities for fuel , food , and other stores for consumption on long voyages , compared to dedicated cruise ships .   Although often luxurious , ocean liners had characteristics that made them unsuitable for cruising , such as high fuel consumption , deep draught that prevented their entering shallow ports , enclosed weatherproof decks that were not appropriate for tropical weather , and cabins designed to maximize passenger numbers rather than comfort ( such as a high proportion of windowless suites ) . The gradual evolution of passenger ship design from ocean liners to cruise ships has seen passenger cabins shifted from inside the hull to the superstructure with private verandas . The modern cruise ships , while sacrificing qualities of seaworthiness , have added amenities to cater to water tourists , and recent vessels have been described as `` balcony-laden floating condominiums '' .   The distinction between ocean liners and cruise ships has blurred , particularly with respect to deployment . Differences in construction remain . Larger cruise ships have also engaged in longer trips such as transoceanic voyages which may not return to the same port for months ( longer round trips ) . Some former ocean liners operate as cruise ships , such as Marco Polo . This number is diminishing . The only dedicated transatlantic ocean liner in operation as a liner ( as of December 2013 ) is Queen Mary 2 of the Cunard fleet . She also has the amenities of contemporary cruise ships and sees significant service on cruises .   Cruising has become a major part of the tourism industry , accounting for U.S. $ 29.4 billion with over 19 million passengers carried worldwide in 2011 . The industry 's rapid growth has seen nine or more newly built ships catering to a North American clientele added every year since 2001 , as well as others servicing European clientele . Smaller markets , such as the Asia-Pacific region , are generally serviced by older ships . These are displaced by new ships in the high growth areas .   The world 's largest cruise ship is currently Royal Caribbean International 's Harmony of the Seas beating her sister ships ( Allure of the Seas and Oasis of the Seas ) by about 2.15 meters .   History   Origins   The birth of leisure cruising began with the formation of the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company in 1822 . The company started out as a shipping line with routes between England and the Iberian Peninsula , adopting the name Peninsular Steam Navigation Company . [ http : //portal.pohub.com/pls/pogprtl/url/ITEM/1E71EC45AF8D6696E0440003BA2CA8EA A Brief History of P & O ] It won its first contract to deliver mail in 1837 . In 1840 , it began mail delivery to Alexandria , Egypt , via Gibraltar and Malta . The company was incorporated by Royal Charter the same year , becoming the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company .   P & O first introduced passenger cruising services in 1844 , advertising sea tours to destinations such as Gibraltar , Malta and Athens , sailing from Southampton . The forerunner of modern cruise holidays , these voyages were the first of their kind , and P & O Cruises has been recognised as the world 's oldest cruise line . The company later introduced round trips to destinations such as Alexandria and Constantinople . It underwent a period of rapid expansion in the latter half of the 19th century , commissioning larger and more luxurious ships to serve the steadily expanding market ."], [66, "Lewis `` Lew '' Wallace ( April 10 , 1827 - February 15 , 1905 ) was an American lawyer , Union general in the American Civil War , governor of the New Mexico Territory , politician , diplomat , and author from Indiana . Among his novels and biographies , Wallace is best known for his historical adventure story , Ben-Hur : A Tale of the Christ ( 1880 ) , a bestselling novel that has been called `` the most influential Christian book of the nineteenth century . ''   Wallace 's military career included service in the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War . He was appointed Indiana 's adjutant general and commanded the 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment . Wallace , who attained the rank of major general , participated in the Battle of Fort Donelson , the Battle of Shiloh , and the Battle of Monocacy . He also served on the military commission for the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators , and presided over the trial of Henry Wirz , the Confederate commandant of the Andersonville prison camp .   Wallace resigned from the U.S. Army in November 1865 and briefly served as a major general in the Mexican army , before returning to the United States . Wallace was appointed governor of the New Mexico Territory ( 1878–81 ) and served as U.S. minister to the Ottoman Empire ( 1881–85 ) . Wallace retired to his home in Crawfordsville , Indiana , where he continued to write until his death in 1905 .   Early life and education   Lewis `` Lew '' Wallace was born on April 10 , 1827 , in Brookville , Indiana . He was the second of four sons born to Esther French Wallace ( née Test ) and David Wallace.McKee , The Early Life of Lew Wallace , p. 206 . Lew 's father , a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy in West Point , New York , left the military in 1822 and moved to Brookville , where he established a law practice and entered Indiana politics . David served in the Indiana General Assembly and later as the state 's lieutenant governor , and governor , and as a member of Congress . Lew Wallace 's maternal grandfather was circuit court judge and Congressman John Test .   In 1832 the family moved to Covington , Indiana , where Lew 's mother died from tuberculosis on July 14 , 1834 . In December 1836 , David married nineteen-year-old Zerelda Gray Sanders Wallace , who later became a prominent suffragist and temperance advocate . In 1837 , after David 's election as governor of Indiana , the family moved to Indianapolis . Morrow , p. 3 .   Lew began his formal education at the age of six at a public school in Covington , but he much preferred the outdoors . Wallace had a talent for drawing and loved to read , but he was a discipline problem at school . In 1836 , at the age of nine , Lew joined his older brother in Crawfordsville , Indiana , where he briefly attended Wabash Preparatory School , but soon transferred to another school more suitable for his age . In 1840 , when Wallace was thirteen , his father sent him to a private academy at Centerville , Indiana , where his teacher encouraged Lew 's natural affinity for writing . Wallace returned to Indianapolis the following year.Gronert , p. 71 .   Sixteen-year-old Lew went out to earn his own wages in 1842 , after his father refused to pay for more schooling . Wallace found a job copying records at the Marion County clerk 's office and lived in an Indianapolis boardinghouse . He also joined the Marion Rifles , a local militia unit , and began writing his first novel , The Fair God , but it was not published until 1873 . Wallace acknowledged in his autobiography that he had never been a member of any organized religion , but he did believe `` in the Christian conception of God '' .   By 1846 , at the start of the Mexican–American War , the nineteen-year-old Wallace was studying law at his father 's law office , but left that pursuit to establish a recruiting office for the Marion Volunteers in Indianapolis . He was appointed a second lieutenant , and on June 19 , 1846 , mustered into military service with the Marion Volunteers ( also known as Company H , 1st Indiana Volunteer Infantry ) . Wallace rose to the position of regimental adjutant and the rank of first lieutenant while serving in the army of Zachary Taylor"], [67, "Pudding is a kind of food that can be either a dessert or a savory dish . The word pudding is believed to come from the French boudin , originally from the Latin botellus , meaning `` small sausage '' , referring to encased meats used in Medieval European puddings .   In the United Kingdom and some of the Commonwealth countries , pudding can be used to describe both sweet and savory dishes . Unless qualified , however , the term in everyday usage typically denotes a dessert ; in the UK , `` pudding '' is used as a synonym for a dessert course . Dessert puddings are rich , fairly homogeneous starch- or dairy-based desserts such as rice pudding , steamed cake mixtures such as Treacle sponge pudding with or without the addition of ingredients such as dried fruits as in a Christmas pudding.Oxford English Dictionary Savory dishes include Yorkshire pudding , black pudding , suet pudding and steak and kidney pudding .   In the United States and some parts of Canada , pudding characteristically denotes a sweet milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based custards , instant custards or a mousse , often commercially set using cornstarch , gelatin or similar collagen agent such as the Jell‑O brand line of products .   In Commonwealth countries these puddings are called custards ( or curds ) if they are egg-thickened , blancmange if starch-thickened , and jelly if gelatin based . Pudding may also refer to other dishes such as bread pudding and rice pudding , although typically these names derive from the origin as British dishes .   History   The modern usage of the word pudding to denote primarily desserts has evolved over time from the almost exclusive use of the term to describe savoury dishes , specifically those created using a process similar to sausages where meat and other ingredients in a mostly liquid form are encased and then steamed or boiled to set the contents . The most famous examples still surviving are blood sausage , which was a favourite of King Henry VIII , and haggis .   Baked , steamed and boiled puddings   The original pudding was formed by mixing various ingredients with a grain product or other binder such as butter , flour , cereal , eggs , and/or suet , resulting in a solid mass . These puddings are baked , steamed or boiled . Depending on its ingredients , such a pudding may be served as a part of the main course or as a dessert .   Boiled or steamed pudding was a common main course aboard ships in the Royal Navy during the 18th and 19th centuries . Pudding was used as the primary dish in which daily rations of flour and suet were prepared .   Steamed pies consisting of a filling completely enclosed by suet pastry are also known as puddings . These may be sweet or savory and include such dishes as steak and kidney pudding .   Types   Savory   Dessert   Creamy puddings   The second and newer type of pudding consists of sugar , milk , and a thickening agent such as cornstarch , gelatin , eggs , rice or tapioca to create a sweet , creamy dessert . These puddings are made either by simmering on top of the stove in a saucepan or double boiler or by baking in an oven , often in a bain-marie . These puddings are easily scorched on the fire , which is why a double boiler is often used ; microwave ovens are also now often used to avoid this problem and to reduce stirring .   Creamy puddings are typically served chilled , but a few , such as zabaglione and rice pudding , may be served warm . Instant puddings do not require boiling and can therefore be prepared more quickly .   This pudding terminology is common in North America and some European countries such as the Netherlands , whilst in Britain egg-thickened puddings are considered custards and starch-thickened puddings called blancmange .   Types   Savory   * Rice pudding   Dessert   Cultural references   * The proverb `` the proof of the pudding is in the eating '' dates back to at least the 14th century . The phrase is widely attributed to the Spanish author Cervantes in his novel The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote . The phrase is often incorrectly stated as `` the proof is in the pudding . ''  * Pudd'nhead Wilson written by Mark Twain reflects the term 's use as a metaphor for someone with"], [68, "Rhinitis or coryza is irritation and inflammation of the mucous membrane inside the nose . Common symptoms are a stuffy nose , runny nose , sneezing , and post-nasal drip .   In rhinitis , the inflammation of the mucous membrane is caused by viruses , bacteria , irritants or allergens . The most common kind of rhinitis is allergic rhinitis , which is usually triggered by airborne allergens such as pollen and dander . Allergic rhinitis may cause additional symptoms , such as sneezing and nasal itching , coughing , headache , fatigue , malaise , and cognitive impairment . The allergens may also affect the eyes , causing watery , reddened , or itchy eyes and puffiness around the eyes . The inflammation results in the generation of large amounts of mucus , commonly producing a runny nose , as well as a stuffy nose and post-nasal drip . In the case of allergic rhinitis , the inflammation is caused by the degranulation of mast cells in the nose . When mast cells degranulate , they release histamine and other chemicals , starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose , such as fatigue and malaise . In the case of infectious rhinitis , it may occasionally lead to pneumonia , either viral pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia . Sneezing also occurs in infectious rhinitis to expel bacteria and viruses from the respiratory system .   Rhinitis is very common . Allergic rhinitis is more common in some countries than others ; in the United States , about 10 % –30 % of adults are affected annually .   Types   Rhinitis is categorized into three types ( although infectious rhinitis is typically regarded as a separate clinical entity due to its transient nature ) : ( i ) infectious rhinitis includes acute and chronic bacterial infections ; ( ii ) nonallergic ( vasomotor ) rhinitis includes idiopathic , hormonal , atrophic , occupational , and gustatory rhinitis , as well as rhinitis medicamentosa ( drug-induced ) ; ( iii ) allergic rhinitis , triggered by pollen , mold , animal dander , dust , Balsam of Peru , and other inhaled allergens .   Infectious   Rhinitis is commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection , including the common cold , which is caused by Rhinoviruses , Coronaviruses , and influenza viruses , others caused by adenoviruses , human parainfluenza viruses , human respiratory syncytial virus , enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses , metapneumovirus , and measles virus , or bacterial sinusitis , which is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and Moraxella catarrhalis . Symptoms of the common cold include rhinorrhea , sneezing , sore throat ( pharyngitis ) , cough , congestion , and slight headache .   Nonallergic rhinitis   Nonallergic rhinitis refers to rhinitis that is not due to an allergy . It was formerly known as vasomotor rhinitis as the cause was thought to be vasodilation caused by an overactive parasympathetic nerve response . It is now encompassed under the more general classification of nonallergic rhinitis . The diagnosis is made upon excluding allergic causes . It is an umbrella term of rhinitis of multiple causes , such as occupational ( chemical ) , smoking , gustatory , hormonal , senile ( rhinitis of the elderly ) , atrophic , medication-induced ( including rhinitis medicamentosa ) , local allergic rhinitis , non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome ( NARES ) and idiopathic ( vasomotor or non-allergic , non-infectious perennial allergic rhinitis ( NANIPER ) , or non-infectious non-allergic rhinitis ( NINAR ) .   In vasomotor rhinitis , certain nonspecific stimuli , including changes in environment ( temperature , humidity , barometric pressure , or weather ) , airborne irritants ( odors , fumes ) , dietary factors ( spicy food , alcohol ) , sexual arousal , exercise , and emotional factors trigger rhinitis . There is still much to be learned about this , but it is thought that these non-allergic triggers cause dilation of the blood vessels in the lining of the nose , which results in swelling and drainage .   Non-allergic rhinitis can co-exist with allergic rhinitis , and is referred to as `` mixed rhinitis . '' The pathology of vasomotor rhinitis appears to involve neurogenic inflammation and is as yet not very well understood . Vasomotor rhinitis appears to be significantly more common in women than men , leading some researchers to believe that hormones play a role . In general , age of onset occurs after 20 years of age , in contrast to allergic rhinitis which can be developed at any age . Individuals with vasomotor rhinitis typically experience"], [69, "British Columbia , ( commonly referred to by its initials BC ) , is the westernmost province of Canada , with a population of more than 4 million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains .  British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion , along with the U.S. states of Idaho , Oregon , Washington and Alaska . The province 's name was chosen in 1858 by members of the Hudson 's Bay Company .   The first British settlement in the area was the Colony of British Columbia ( 1858–66 ) , the first Lieutenant-Governor of which , from 1858 to 1863 ,  was Richard Clement Moody , who was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire 's `` bulwark in the farthest west ''  , and “ to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific ” . Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia , New Westminster and established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park . Port Moody is named after him . In 1871 , British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada . Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu ( `` Splendour without Diminishment '' ) .   The capital of British Columbia is Victoria , the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada , named for the Queen who created the Colony of British Columbia . The largest city is Vancouver , the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada , the largest in Western Canada , and the second-largest in the Pacific Northwest . In October 2013 , British Columbia had an estimated population of 4,606,371 ( about 2.5 million of whom were in Greater Vancouver ) . The province is currently governed by the BC Liberal Party , led by Premier Christy Clark , who became leader as a result of a leadership convention vote on February 26 , 2011 , and who led her party to an election victory on May 14 , 2013 .   British Columbia evolved from British possessions that were established in what is now British Columbia by 1871 . First Nations , the original inhabitants of the land , have a history of at least 10,000 years in the area . Today there are few treaties and the question of Aboriginal Title , long ignored , has become a legal and political question of frequent debate as a result of recent court actions . Notably , the Tsilhqot'in Nation has established Aboriginal title to a portion of their territory , as a result of the recent Supreme Court of Canada decision ( William [ Tsilhqot'in Nation ] v. British Columbia ) .   B.C . 's economy is diverse , with service producing industries accounting for the largest portion of the province 's GDP . It is the endpoint of transcontinental railways , and the site of major Pacific ports that enable international trade . Though less than 5 % of its vast 944735 km2 land is arable , the province is agriculturally rich , ( particularly in the Fraser and Okanagan valleys ) , because of milder weather near the coast and in certain sheltered southern valleys . Its climate encourages outdoor recreation and tourism , though its economic mainstay has long been resource extraction , principally logging , farming , and mining . Vancouver , the province 's largest city and metropolitan area , also serves as the headquarters of many western-based natural resource companies . It also benefits from a strong housing market and a per capita income well above the national average . While the coast of British Columbia and certain valleys in the south-central part of the province have mild weather , the majority of its land mass experiences a cold-winter-temperate climate similar to that of the rest of Canada . The Northern Interior region has a subarctic climate with very cold winters . The climate of Vancouver is by far the mildest winter climate of the major Canadian cities , with nighttime January temperatures averaging above the freezing point .   Etymology   The province 's name was chosen by Queen Victoria , when the Colony of British Columbia , i.e. , `` the Mainland '' , became a British colony in 1858 . It refers to the Columbia District , the British name for the territory drained by the Columbia River , in southeastern British Columbia , which was the namesake of the pre-Oregon Treaty Columbia Department of the Hudson 's Bay Company . Queen Victoria chose British Columbia to distinguish what was the British sector of the Columbia District from that of the United States ("], [70, "Keflavík International Airport ( ) , also known as Reykjavík-Keflavík Airport , is the largest airport in Iceland and the country 's main hub for international transportation . The airport is west of Keflavík and 50 km southwest of Reykjavík . The airport has three runways , two of which are in use , and the airport area is about 25 km2 . Most international journeys to or from Iceland pass through this airport .   The main carriers at Keflavík are Icelandair and WOW air , each of which has the airport as its main hub . The airport is almost exclusively used for international flights ; most domestic flights use Reykjavík Airport , which lies 3 km from Reykjavík 's city centre , although seasonal flights from Akureyri fly to Keflavík . Keflavík Airport is operated by Isavia , a government enterprise .   History   Early years   Originally , the airport was built by the United States military during World War II and opened on March 23 , 1943 . The U.S. named it Meeks Field after a young pilot , George Meeks , who died on the Reykjavík airfield . After the war , the airport and the base were returned to Iceland 's control and were renamed for the nearby town of Keflavik . In 1951 , the U.S. military returned to the airport under a defense agreement between Iceland and the U.S. Later , Iceland joined NATO .   Development since the 1950s   With the reestablishment of the military air base at Keflavík during the 1950s , the air terminal found itself in the middle of a secure military zone . Travelers had to pass through military check points to reach their flights , until 1987 , when the civilian terminal was relocated ...   The presence of foreign military forces in Iceland under the NATO sponsored Iceland–U.S . Defense Agreement of 1951 was controversial in Iceland , which had no indigenous military forces other than the Icelandic Coast Guard . During the 1960s and 1970s , rallies were held to protest the U.S. military presence in Iceland ( and in particular at Keflavík ) , and every year protesters walked the 50 km road from Reykjavík to Keflavík and chanted `` Ísland úr NATO , herinn burt '' ( literally : Iceland out of NATO , the military away ) . The protests were not effective . One of the participants was Vigdís Finnbogadóttir , who later became the first female President of Iceland .   The former Agreed Military Area at Keflavík was re-designated `` Airport , Security and Development Area '' under the supervision of the Keflavík International Airport Ltd. ( established 1 January 2009 ) , the Icelandic Coast Guard and the Keflavík Airport Development Corporation ( Kadeco ) , respectively . The Coast Guard maintains hangars for military aircraft as well as ammunition depots , air defence radars and other military equipment for national defence . The former military encampment area ( U.S . Naval Air Station Keflavik ) being developed by Kadeco has been named Ásbrú to reflect its new role . The airport is in the little village named Sandgerði , but the runway leads to Keflavík .   The 10000 ft and 200 ft runways are long enough to support NASA 's Space Shuttle and also the Antonov An-225 . On 29 June 1999 , Concorde G-BOAA flew from Heathrow Airport to Reykjavík ( Keflavík airport ) . The Concorde had been there .   Facilities   The Airport is named after Leifur Eiríksson who was the first European to discover North America . Air Terminal ( ) , named for Leif Ericson . It was opened 6 April 1987 and separated the airport 's civil traffic from the military base . It was later extended with the opening of the South Building in 2001 ( not a separate terminal ) to comply with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement . The North Building was later enlarged and finished in 2007 . The terminal has duty-free stores in the departure and arrival lounges .   In 2016 , the current terminal was expanded .  The expansion added 7 gates . There are also plans to add a third runway .   Airlines and destinations   Although the population of Iceland is only about 300,000 , there are scheduled flights to and from numerous locations across North America and Europe . The largest carrier operating out of Keflavík is Icelandair . On 23 October 2012 WOW air acquired Iceland Express making it the second largest Icelandic carrier and the second largest at Keflavík . The airport only handles international flights"], [71, "Edgar Chagwa Lungu ( born 11 November 1956 ) has been the President of Zambia since January 2015 . Under President Michael Sata , Lungu served as Minister of Justice and Minister of Defense . Following Sata 's death in October 2014 , Lungu was adopted as the candidate of Sata 's party , the Patriotic Front , for the January 2015 presidential by-election . In the election , he narrowly defeated opposition candidate Hakainde Hichilema and took office on 25 January 2015 .   Early life and career   Lungu was born 11 November 1956 at Ndola Central Hospital . After graduating with a LL.B . in 1981 from University of Zambia , he joined the law firm Andre Masiye and Company in Lusaka . He subsequently underwent military officer training at Miltez in Kabwe under Zambia National Service ( ZNS ) . He then returned to practising law . He then joined politics .   Political career   He joined the United Party for National Development under the leadership of Anderson Mazoka , but later switched to the Patriotic Front ( PF ) led by party founder Michael Sata .   After the PF won the 2011 election , Lungu became Junior Minister in the Vice President 's office . He was subsequently promoted to Minister of Home Affairs on 9 July 2012 . He became Minister of Defence on 24 December 2013 after Geoffrey Bwalya Mwamba resigned from his ministerial post , and he functioned as Acting President during President Sata 's long term illness in 2013-14 . He has also held a string of central positions in his party , including Chair of the PF Central Committee on Discipline , and he became PF Secretary General and Minister of Justice on 28 August 2014 to replace Wynter Kabimba , who was fired . These positions were in addition to the Defence portfolio .   President Sata went abroad for medical treatment on 19 October 2014 , leaving Lungu in charge of the country in his absence . Sata died on 28 October 2014 . Vice President Guy Scott took over as Acting President , and Lungu was viewed as one of the main contenders to ultimately succeed Sata in a presidential by-election .   On 3 November 2014 , Acting President Scott dismissed Lungu as Secretary-General of the PF . He replaced him with Davis Mwila , the Member of Parliament for Chipili . However , the next day , on 4 November 2014 , Scott announced Lungu was to remain as Secretary-General .

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States such as folk music , Blues music , and Western music . Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history . Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos , electric and acoustic guitars , dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas . The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music ; it came to encompass Western music , which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots , in the mid-20th century . The term country music is used today to describe many styles and subgenres . The origins of country music are the folk music of mostly white , working-class Americans , who blended popular songs , Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes , traditional ballads , and cowboy songs , and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities . In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute , and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States .   Generations of country music   Immigrants to the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North America brought the music and instruments of Europe along with them for nearly 300 years . Country music was `` introduced to the world as a Southern phenomenon . '' The first generation emerged in the early 1920s , with Atlanta 's music scene playing a major role in launching country 's earliest recording artists . Okeh Records began issuing hillbilly music records by Fiddlin ' John Carson as early as 1923 , followed by Columbia Records ( series 15000D `` Old Familiar Tunes '' ) ( Samantha Bumgarner ) in 1924 , and RCA Victor Records in 1927 ( the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers ) . Many `` hillbilly '' musicians , such as Cliff Carlisle , recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s .   During the second generation ( 1930s–1940s ) , radio became a popular source of entertainment , and `` barn dance '' shows featuring country music were started all over the South , as far north as Chicago , and as far west as California . The most important was the Grand Ole Opry , aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day . During the 1930s and 1940s , cowboy songs , or Western music , which had been recorded since the 1920s , were popularized by films made in Hollywood . Bob Wills was another country musician from the Lower Great Plains who had become very popular as the leader of a `` hot string band , '' and who also appeared in Hollywood westerns . His mix of country and jazz , which started out as dance hall music , would become known as Western swing . Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band , in 1938 . Country musicians began recording boogie in 1939 , shortly after it had been played at Carnegie Hall , when Johnny Barfield recorded `` Boogie Woogie '' .   The third generation ( 1950s–1960s ) started at the end of World War II with `` mountaineer '' string band music known as bluegrass , which emerged when Bill Monroe , along with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs were introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry . Gospel music remained a popular component of country music . Another type of stripped-down and raw music with a variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar , bass , dobro or steel guitar ( and later ) drums became popular , especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma . It became known as honky tonk , and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states . By the early 1950s a blend of Western swing , country boogie , and honky tonk was played by most country bands . Rockabilly was most popular with country fans in the 1950s , and 1956 could be called the year of rockabilly in country music . Beginning in the mid-1950s , and reaching its peak during the early 1960s , the Nashville Sound turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in Nashville , Tennessee . The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres . In the aftermath of the British Invasion"], [73, "In-N-Out Burger is a regional chain of fast food restaurants with locations primarily in the American Southwest and Pacific coast . Founded in Baldwin Park , California , in 1948 by Harry Snyder and his wife Esther Snyder . The chain is currently headquartered in Irvine , California and has slowly expanded outside Southern California into the rest of California , as well as into Arizona , Nevada , Utah , Texas , and Oregon . The current owner is Lynsi Snyder , the Snyders ' only grandchild .   As the chain has expanded , it has opened several distribution centers in addition to its original Baldwin Park location . The new facilities , located in Lathrop , California ; Phoenix , Arizona ; Draper , Utah ; and Dallas , Texas will provide for potential future expansion into other parts of the country .   In-N-Out Burger has resisted franchising its operations or going public ; one reason is the prospect of quality or customer consistency being compromised by excessively rapid business growth . The company 's business practices have been noted for employee-centered personnel policies . For example , In-N-Out is one of the few fast food chains in the United States to pay its employees more than state and federally mandated minimum wage guidelines – starting at US $ 9.25 per hour in California , as of August 2001 . The In-N-Out restaurant chain has developed a highly loyal customer base , and has been rated as one of the top fast food restaurants in several customer satisfaction surveys .   History   First generation   In-N-Out 's first location was opened in the Los Angeles suburb of Baldwin Park , California in 1948 by the Snyders at the southwest corner of what is now the intersection of Interstate 10 and Francisquito Avenue . The restaurant was the first drive-thru hamburger stand in California , allowing drivers to place orders via a two-way speaker system . This was a new and unique idea , since in post-World War II California , carhops were used to take orders and serve food . According to the company 's website , the Snyders had a simple plan that is still in use today : `` Give customers the freshest , highest quality foods you can buy and provide them with friendly service in a sparkling clean environment . ''   A second In-N-Out was opened west of the intersection of Grand Avenue and Arrow Highway in Covina , California , three years later . The company remained a relatively small southern California chain until the 1970s . The Snyders managed their first restaurants closely to ensure quality was maintained . The chain had 18 restaurants when Harry Snyder died in 1976 , at the age of 63 .   Second generation   In 1976 , 24-year-old Rich Snyder became the company president after his father 's death . Along with his brother Guy , Rich had reportedly begun working in his father 's In-N-Outs `` from the ground floor '' at an early age . Over the next 20 years , the chain experienced a period of rapid growth under Rich 's leadership , expanding to 93 restaurants .   The first location outside of the Los Angeles metropolitan area was opened in San Diego County in 1990 , the 61st location in the chain . In 1992 , In-N-Out opened its first non-Southern California restaurant in Las Vegas , Nevada . Its first Northern California location was opened the following year in Modesto . Expansion then spread to Northern California , including the San Francisco Bay Area , while additional Las Vegas-area restaurants were added . However , after opening the 83rd In-N-Out restaurant in Fresno , California , on December 15 , 1993 , Rich Snyder and four other passengers died in a plane crash on approach to John Wayne Airport in Orange County , California . The charter aircraft they were on had been following a Boeing 757 in for landing , became caught in its wake turbulence , and crashed . The ensuing crash investigation led to the Federal Aviation Administration requirement for an adequate distance between heavy aircraft and following light aircraft to allow wake turbulence to diminish .   Upon Rich Snyder 's death in 1993 , Guy Snyder assumed the presidency and continued the company 's aggressive expansion until he died from an overdose of painkillers in 1999 . He was president for six years , expanding In-N-Out from 83 to 140 locations . His mother Esther subsequently took over the presidency .

It was a period of sustained economic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in the United States , Canada and Western Europe , particularly in major cities such as New York , Montreal , Chicago , Detroit , Paris , Berlin , London and Los Angeles . In France and Quebec , it was known as the `` années folles '' ( `` Crazy Years '' ) , emphasizing the era 's social , artistic and cultural dynamism . Normalcy returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism after World War I , jazz music blossomed , the flapper redefined modern womanhood and Art Deco peaked . The era saw the large-scale use of automobiles , telephones , motion pictures , radio , electricity , refrigeration , air conditioning ; commercial , passenger , and freight aviation ; unprecedented industrial growth , accelerated consumer demand and aspirations , plus significant changes in lifestyle and culture . The media focused on celebrities , especially sports heroes and movie stars , as cities rooted for their home teams and filled the new palatial cinemas and gigantic sports stadiums . In most major countries women won the right to vote .   The Wall Street Crash of 1929 ended the era , as the Great Depression set in bringing years of worldwide gloom and hardship .  The social and cultural features known as the Roaring Twenties began in leading metropolitan centers , especially Chicago , New Orleans , Los Angeles , New York City , Philadelphia , Paris , Berlin and London ; then spread widely in the aftermath of World War I . Thus , when Germany could no longer afford war reparations to Britain , France and other Allies , the Americans came up with the Dawes Plan and Wall Street invested heavily in Germany , which repaid its reparations to nations that in turn used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington . By the middle of the decade prosperity was widespread , with the second half of the decade especially in Germany known as the `` Golden Twenties '' .   The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity and a break with traditions . Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology . New technologies , especially automobiles , moving pictures and radio proliferated `` modernity '' to a large part of the population . Formal decorative frills were shed in favor of practicality in both daily life and architecture . At the same time , jazz and dancing rose in popularity , in opposition to the mood of the specter of World War I . As such , the period is also often referred to as the Jazz Age .   Economy   The Roaring Twenties was a decade of great economic growth and widespread prosperity driven by recovery from wartime devastation and postponed spending , a boom in construction , and the rapid growth of consumer goods such as automobiles and electricity . The economy of the United States , which had successfully transitioned from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy , boomed and provided loans for a European boom as well . However , some sectors were stagnant , especially farming and mining . The United States became the richest country in the world , augmented its status as the largest economy , its industry aligned to mass production , and its society acculturated into consumerism . European economies had a more difficult readjustment and began to flourish about 1924 .   At the end of World War I , soldiers returned to the United States and Canada with wartime wages and many new products on the market on which to spend . At first , the recession of wartime production caused a brief but deep recession , known as the post–World War I recession . Quickly , however , the U.S. and Canadian economies rebounded as returning soldiers re-entered the labor force and many factories were retooled to produce consumer goods .   Economic policies   The 1920s were a decade of increased consumer spending and economic pen growth fed by supply side economic policy . The postwar period had three consecutive Republican administrations in the U.S . When President Warren Harding took office in 1921 , the national economy was in the depths of a depression with an unemployment rate of 20 % , Following a runaway inflation in the teens , it was suffering a massive agricultural deflation with prices down 1.55 % in 1920 and over 11 % in 1921 ."], [75, "A Brief History of Time : From the Big Bang to Black Holes is a 1988 popular-science book by British physicist Stephen Hawking . It became a bestseller and sold more than 10 million copies in 20 years . It was also on the London Sunday Times bestseller list for more than four years and was translated into 35 languages by 2001 .   Summary   Stephen Hawking attempts to explain a range of subjects in cosmology , including the Big Bang , black holes and light cones , to the nonspecialist reader . His main goal is to give an overview of the subject , but he also attempts to explain some complex mathematics . In the 1996 edition of the book and subsequent editions , Hawking discusses the possibility of time travel and wormholes and explores the possibility of having a universe without a quantum singularity at the beginning of time .   Early in 1983 , Hawking first approached Simon Mitton , the editor in charge of astronomy books at Cambridge University Press , with his ideas for a popular book on cosmology . Mitton was doubtful about all the equations in the draft manuscript , which he felt would put off the buyers in airport bookshops that Hawking wished to reach . With some difficulty , he persuaded Hawking to drop all but one equation . The author himself notes in the book 's acknowledgements that he was warned that for every equation in the book , the readership would be halved , hence it includes only a single equation : E = mc2 . The book does employ a number of complex models , diagrams , and other illustrations to detail some of the concepts it explores .   Editions   * 1988 : The first edition included an introduction by Carl Sagan that tells the following story : Sagan was in London for a scientific conference in 1974 , and between sessions he wandered into a different room , where a larger meeting was taking place . `` I realized that I was watching an ancient ceremony : the investiture of new fellows into the Royal Society , one of the most ancient scholarly organizations on the planet . In the front row , a young man in a wheelchair was , very slowly , signing his name in a book that bore on its earliest pages the signature of Isaac Newton ... Stephen Hawking was a legend even then . '' In his introduction , Sagan goes on to add that Hawking is the `` worthy successor '' to Newton and Paul Dirac , both former Lucasian Professors of Mathematics .   The introduction was removed after the first edition , as it was copyrighted by Sagan , rather than by Hawking or the publisher , and the publisher did not have the right to reprint it in perpetuity . Hawking wrote his own introduction for later editions .   * 1996 , Illustrated , updated and expanded edition : This hardcover edition contained full-color illustrations and photographs to help further explain the text , as well as the addition of topics that were not included in the original book .  * 1998 , Tenth-anniversary edition : It features the same text as the one published in 1996 , but was also released in paperback and has only a few diagrams included . ISBN 0553109537  * 2005 , A Briefer History of Time : a collaboration with Leonard Mlodinow of an abridged version of the original book . It was updated again to address new issues that had arisen due to further scientific development . ISBN 0-553-80436-7   Film   In 1991 , Errol Morris directed a documentary film about Hawking , but although they share a title , the film is a biographical study of Hawking , and not a filmed version of the book .   Opera   The New York 's Metropolitan Opera has commissioned an opera to premiere in 2015–16 based on Hawking 's book . It will be composed by Osvaldo Golijov with a libretto by Alberto Manguel in a production by Robert Lepage ."], [76, "A prime minister is the most senior minister of cabinet in the executive branch of government , often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system . In many systems , the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet , and allocates posts to members within the government . In most systems , the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet . In a minority of systems , notably in semi-presidential systems of government , a prime minister is the official who is appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state .   In parliamentary systems fashioned after the Westminster system , the prime minister is the presiding and actual head of government and head of the executive branch . In such systems , the head of state or the head of state 's official representative ( i.e . the monarch , president , or governor-general ) usually holds a largely ceremonial position , although often with reserve powers .   The prime minister is often , but not always , a member of parliament and is expected with other ministers to ensure the passage of bills through the legislature . In some monarchies the monarch may also exercise executive powers ( known as the royal prerogative ) that are constitutionally vested in the crown and may be exercised without the approval of parliament .   As well as being head of government , a prime minister may have other roles or titles—the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , for example , is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service . Prime ministers may take other ministerial posts—for example , during the Second World War , Winston Churchill was also Minister of Defence ( although there was then no Ministry of Defence ) , and in the current cabinet of Israel , Benjamin Netanyahu also serves as Minister of Communications , Foreign Affairs , Regional Cooperation , Economy and Interior   Etymology   The first actual usage of the term prime minister or Premier Ministre was used by Cardinal Richelieu when in 1625 he was named to head the royal council as prime minister of France . Louis XIV and his descendants generally attempted to avoid giving this title to their chief ministers .   The term prime minister in the sense that we know it originated in the 18th century in the United Kingdom when members of parliament disparagingly used the title in reference to Sir Robert Walpole . Over time , the title became honorific and remains so in the 21st century .   History   Origins   The monarchs of England and the United Kingdom had ministers in whom they placed special trust and who were regarded as the head of the government . Examples were Thomas Cromwell under Henry VIII ; William Cecil , Lord Burghley under Elizabeth I ; Clarendon under Charles II and Godolphin under Queen Anne . These ministers held a variety of formal posts , but were commonly known as `` the minister '' , the `` chief minister '' , the `` first minister '' and finally the `` prime minister '' .   The power of these ministers depended entirely on the personal favour of the monarch . Although managing the parliament was among the necessary skills of holding high office , they did not depend on a parliamentary majority for their power . Although there was a cabinet , it was appointed entirely by the monarch , and the monarch usually presided over its meetings .   When the monarch grew tired of a first minister , he or she could be dismissed , or worse : Cromwell was executed and Clarendon driven into exile when they lost favour . Kings sometimes divided power equally between two or more ministers to prevent one minister from becoming too powerful . Late in Anne 's reign , for example , the Tory ministers Harley and St John shared power .   Development   In the mid 17th century , after the English Civil War ( 1642–1651 ) , Parliament strengthened its position relative to the monarch then gained more power through the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689 . The monarch could no longer establish any law or impose any tax without its permission and thus the House of Commons became a part of the government . It is at this point that a modern style of prime minister begins to emerge .   A tipping point in the evolution of the prime ministership came with the death of Anne in"], [77, "Labyrinth is a 1986 British-American adventure musical fantasy film directed by Jim Henson , executive produced by George Lucas , and based upon conceptual designs by Brian Froud . The film revolves around 16-year-old Sarah 's ( Jennifer Connelly ) quest to reach the center of an enormous otherworldly maze to rescue her infant brother Toby , who has been kidnapped by Jareth , the Goblin King ( David Bowie ) . With the exception of Bowie and Connelly , most of the significant characters in the film are played by puppets produced by Jim Henson 's Creature Shop .   The film started as a collaboration between Henson and Froud , with ideas for the film first being discussed between them following a screening of their previous collaboration , The Dark Crystal . Terry Jones of Monty Python wrote the first draft of the film 's script early in 1984 , drawing on Froud 's sketches for inspiration . Various other script-writers , including Laura Phillips ( who had previously written several episodes of Fraggle Rock ) , Lucas , Dennis Lee , and Elaine May , subsequently re-wrote and made additions to the screenplay , although Jones received the film 's sole screen-writing credit . Labyrinth was shot on location in Upper Nyack , Piermont and Haverstraw in New York , and at Elstree Studios and West Wycombe Park in the United Kingdom .   The New York Times reported that Labyrinth had a budget of $ 25 million . The film was a box office disappointment and only grossed $ 12.7 million during its U.S. theatrical run . The commercial failure of the film demoralized Henson to the extent that his son Brian remembered the time of the film 's release as one of the most difficult periods of his father 's career . It would be the last feature film directed by Henson before his death in 1990 .   Although it was met with a mixed critical response upon its original release , Labyrinth has since gained a large cult following . A four-volume manga sequel to the film , Return to Labyrinth , was published by Tokyopop between 2006-10 . In 2012 , Archaia Studios Press announced they were developing a graphic novel prequel to the film . In January 2016 , it was announced that a reboot was in development , which was later denied by screenwriter Nicole Perlman .   Plot   Sixteen-year-old Sarah Williams rehearses a play in the park with her dog Merlin and becomes distracted by a line she is unable to remember while being watched by a barn owl . Realizing she is late to babysit her baby brother Toby , she rushes home and is confronted by her stepmother Irene before she and her father Robert leave for dinner . Sarah realizes that Toby is in possession of her treasured teddy bear Lancelot . Frustrated by this and his constant crying , Sarah rashly wishes Toby be taken away by the Goblin King Jareth , a character in the play she is rehearsing . She is shocked when Toby disappears and the Goblin King confronts her and transports her to his kingdom . He refuses to return the baby , but gives Sarah thirteen hours to solve his Labyrinth and find him before Toby is turned into a goblin . Sarah meets the dwarvish Hoggle , who aids her in entering the Labyrinth , but a talking worm inadvertently sends her in the wrong direction .   Sarah ends up in an oubliette where she reunites with Hoggle . After they confront Jareth and escape one of his traps , the two encounter a large beast named Ludo . Hoggle flees while Sarah befriends Ludo . After another riddle , she loses him in a forest . Hoggle encounters Jareth , who gives him a peach and instructs him to give it to Sarah , calling his loyalty into question as he was supposed to lead her out of the maze . Sarah is assaulted by a group of creatures with detachable body parts who try to remove her head , but Hoggle comes to her aid . She kisses him , and Jareth magically sends them to the Bog of Eternal Stench as punishment , where they reunite with Ludo . Sarah , Hoggle , and Ludo meet the guard of a bridge out of the swamp named Sir Didymus , an anthropomorphic fox and his Old English Sheepdog steed named Ambrosius ( who bears a resemblance to Merlin ) . After Ludo saves Sarah from falling into the swamp , Didymus joins the group . After the group gets hungry , Hoggle gives Sarah the peach and runs away"], [78, "Scrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles , each bearing a single letter , onto a gameboard which is divided into a 15×15 grid of squares . The tiles must form words which , in crossword fashion , flow left to right in rows or downwards in columns . The words must be defined in a standard dictionary , or present in specified reference works ( e.g. , the Official Tournament and Club Word List , the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary ) , which provide a list of officially permissible words .   The name Scrabble is a trademark of Hasbro , Inc. in the United States and Canada and has been sold by Hasbro 's Parker Brothers division since 1999 . Prior to 1999 , it was sold as a Milton Bradley game . Outside the United States and Canada , Scrabble is a trademark of Mattel . The game is sold in 121 countries and is available in 29 languages ; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide and roughly one-third of American and half of British homes have a Scrabble set . There are around 4,000 Scrabble clubs around the world .   Game details   The game is played by two to four players on a square board with a 15×15 grid of cells ( individually known as `` squares '' ) , each of which accommodates a single letter tile .  In official club and tournament games , play is between two players or , occasionally , between two teams each of which collaborates on a single rack .   The board is marked with `` premium '' squares , which multiply the number of points awarded : eight dark red `` triple-word '' squares , 17 pink `` double-word '' squares , of which one , the center square ( H8 ) , is marked with a star or other symbol ; 12 dark blue `` triple-letter '' squares , and 24 light blue `` double-letter '' squares . In 2008 , Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW , red for DW , blue for DL , and green for TL . Despite this , the original premium square color scheme is still the preferred scheme for Scrabble boards used in tournaments .   In an English-language set , the game contains 100 tiles , 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value ranging from 1 to 10 . The number of points of each lettered tile is based on the letter 's frequency in standard English writing ; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point , while less common letters score higher , with Q and Z each worth 10 points . The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value . The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter ; once laid on the board , however , the choice is fixed . Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values .   Tiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are 19 x square and 4 mm thick , making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board . Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition varies the width up to 2 mm for different letters . Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles ( e.g . 13 x ) ; sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place . The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter 's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner .   S is the most valuable letter in English-language Scrabble because it easily goes on the ends of words ; Alfred Butts included only four instances to avoid a game that was `` too easy '' . Q is considered the most problematic letter , as most words with it also contain U ; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French , Dutch , Italian and German . J is also difficult to play due to its low frequency and a scarcity of words having it at the end . C and V may be troublesome in the endgame , since no two-letter words with them exist , save for CH in SOWPODS .   History   In 1938 , American architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented called Lexiko . The two games had the same set of letter tiles , whose distributions and point"], [79, 'Tenerife South Airport ( ) , previously known as Tenerife South-Reina Sofia Airport , is the larger of the two international airports located on the island of Tenerife ( the other being Tenerife North Airport ) and the second busiest in the Canary Islands . It is located in the municipality of Granadilla de Abona and handled over 9 million passengers in 2014 .   History   In the late 1960s , the island authorities of Tenerife Identified the need for a new airport at a new location as the existing airport did not meet technical requirements due to adverse weather conditions .   The new airport was inaugurated on 6 November 1978 , by Queen Sofía of Spain , to whom the airport is dedicated . The first flight was Iberia flight IB187 from Lanzarote , which was operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 landing at 10:17 .

It is currently the majority party in the House of Commons , having won 330 of the 650 seats in the 2015 general election . Between 2010 and 2015 it was the largest single party with 306 Members of Parliament and governed in coalition with the Liberal Democrats . It is the largest party in local government with 8,296 councillors .   The Conservative Party was founded in 1834 from the Tory Party—giving rise to the Conservatives ' colloquial name of Tories—and was one of two dominant parties in the 19th century , along with the Liberal Party . In the 1920s , the Liberal vote greatly diminished and the Labour Party became the Conservatives ' main rivals . Conservative Prime Ministers led governments for 57 years of the 20th century , including Winston Churchill ( 1940–45 , 1951–55 ) and Margaret Thatcher ( 1979–90 ) . Thatcher 's tenure led to wide-ranging economic liberalisation and saw the Conservatives become the most eurosceptic of the three major parties . The Conservative Party 's domination of British politics throughout the 20th century have led to them being referred to as one of the most successful political parties in the Western world .   The Conservatives are the joint-second largest British party in the European Parliament , with twenty MEPs , and sit with the European Conservatives and Reformists ( ECR ) parliamentary group . The party is a member of the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists ( AECR ) Europarty and the International Democrat Union ( IDU ) .   The party is the second-largest in the Scottish Parliament and third-largest in the Welsh Assembly . The Conservatives were formerly allied to the Ulster Unionist Party ( UUP ) in Northern Ireland but there is now a separate Northern Ireland Conservative party similar to the Welsh and Scottish Conservative parties . The party is also organised in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar .   History   Pittites   The Conservative Party traces its origins to a faction , rooted in the 18th century Whig Party , that coalesced around William Pitt the Younger ( Prime Minister of Great Britain 1783–1801 and 1804–1806 ) . They were known as `` Independent Whigs '' , `` Friends of Mr Pitt '' , or `` Pittites '' . After Pitt 's death the term `` Tory '' came into use . This was an allusion to the Tories , a political grouping that had existed from 1678 , but which had no organisational continuity with the Pittite party . From about 1812 on the name `` Tory '' was commonly used for the newer party .   The term `` Conservative '' was suggested as a title for the party by a magazine article by J. Wilson Croker in the Quarterly Review in 1830 . The name immediately caught on and was officially adopted under the aegis of Sir Robert Peel around 1834 . Peel is acknowledged as the founder of the Conservative Party , which he created with the announcement of the Tamworth Manifesto . The term `` Conservative Party '' rather than Tory was the dominant usage by 1845 .   Conservatives and Unionists ( 1867–1965 )   The widening of the electoral franchise in the 19th century forced the Conservative Party to popularise its approach under Lord Derby and Benjamin Disraeli , who carried through their own expansion of the franchise with the Reform Act of 1867 . In 1886 the party formed an alliance with Lord Hartington ( later the 8th Duke of Devonshire ) and Joseph Chamberlain 's new Liberal Unionist Party and , under the statesmen Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour , held power for all but three of the following twenty years before suffering a heavy defeat in 1906 when it split over the issue of free trade . In 1912 , the Liberal Unionists merged with the Conservative party . In Ireland , the Irish Unionist Alliance had been formed in 1891 which merged anti-Home Rule Unionists into one political movement . Its MPs took the Conservative whip at Westminster , and in essence formed the Irish wing of the party until 1922 .   First World War   The Conservatives served with the Liberals in an all-party coalition government during World War I , and the coalition continued under the Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George ( with half of the Liberals ) until 1922 . Keohane finds that the Conservatives were bitterly divided before 1914 , especially on the issue of Irish Unionism and the experience of three consecutive election losses"], [81, "Absolutely Fabulous , also known as Ab Fab , is a BBC television sitcom created by , written by and starring Jennifer Saunders . It is based on a 1990 French & Saunders sketch created by Saunders and Dawn French .   The series features Saunders as Edina Monsoon , a heavy-drinking , drug-abusing PR agent who spends her time chasing bizarre fads in a desperate attempt to stay young and `` hip '' . Edina is joined in her quest by magazine editor Patsy Stone ( played by Joanna Lumley ) , her best friend and enabler , whose drug abuse , alcohol consumption , and promiscuity far eclipse Edina 's comparatively mild self-destructive behaviour . Despite being a middle-aged , twice-divorced career woman , Edina is reliant upon the support of her daughter Saffron ( Julia Sawalha ) , a secondary school pupil ( and later university student ) whose constant care of her mother has left her a bitter cynic . The series also stars June Whitfield as Edina 's sarcastic and thieving mother , and Jane Horrocks as Edina 's brainless personal assistant .   Absolutely Fabulous returned for three special episodes which were originally broadcast on 25 December 2011 , 1 January 2012 and 23 July 2012 to mark the show 's 20th anniversary . The episode broadcast on 23 July 2012 featured the 2012 Summer Olympics which were being held in London that week .   A film based on the series was released to theatres on 1 July 2016 .   Production   The show has had an extended and sporadic run . The first three series were broadcast on the BBC from 1992 to 1995 , followed by a series finale in the form of a two-part television film entitled The Last Shout in 1996 . Creator Jennifer Saunders revived the show for a fourth series in 2001 , after having written and submitted a pilot entitled Mirrorball , which recruited nearly all of the original cast in new roles . The pilot was intended to be turned into a series of episodes . However , Saunders felt the characters were far too rich and interesting to put aside , and were far better suited for her new story ideas . Instead of Mirrorball , a new series of Absolutely Fabulous was proposed to the BBC , which later commissioned the fourth series in 2001 . From 2001 to 2004 , two full series were produced , along with three one-off hour-long specials ; Gay ( retitled and issued as Absolutely Fabulous in New York for the United States ) in 2002 , Cold Turkey , a Christmas special in 2003 , and White Box ( another series finale ) , which aired in 2004 . A Comic Relief sketch was broadcast in 2005 .   In August 2011 , Lumley confirmed the planned filming of three new episodes . In 2011 , plans for a 20th anniversary revival were welcomed in The Guardian , which applauded the show as `` prophetic '' . The first new special was broadcast on 25 December with the second episode being shown on 1 January 2012 . The third , and final special coincided with the 2012 Summer Olympics , with Stella McCartney appearing in a cameo role . A film version of the series was released in summer 2016 .   In the United States , the first of the three new 20th anniversary specials aired in January 2012 for broadcast by both BBC America and Logo Channel . Both channels also co-produced the 20th Anniversary episodes , although Logo has removed some scenes for its airings . BBC America broadcast it in full . Both channels aired the episode in a 40-minute block to allow for commercial interruptions .   Absolutely Fabulous is ranked as the 17th greatest British TV show of all time by the British Film Institute . A scene from the show was included in the 100 Greatest TV Moments programme broadcast by Channel 4 . In 1997 , the pilot episode , `` Fashion '' , was ranked number 47 on TV Guide 's `` 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time '' list . In 2004 and 2007 , the series was ranked number 24 and number 29 on TV Guide 's Top Cult Shows Ever list .   Background   Absolutely Fabulous evolved from a French & Saunders sketch called `` Modern Mother and Daughter '' ( from series 3 episode 6 ) , which starred Saunders as the mother ( named 'Adrianna ' ) and French as the daughter , already named Saffron . The sketch revolved around a middle-aged , single mother who acted like a teenager"], [82, "New Zealand ( ) is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . The country geographically comprises two main landmasses – that of the North Island , or Te Ika-a-Māui , and the South Island , or Te Waipounamu – and numerous smaller islands . New Zealand is situated some 1500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1000 km south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal , fungal and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , while its most populous city is Auckland .   Sometime between 1250 and 1300 CE , Polynesians settled in the islands that would later become New Zealand , and developed a distinctive Māori culture . In 1642 , Abel Tasman , a Dutch explorer , became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the British Crown and Māori Chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , making New Zealand a British colony . Today , the majority of New Zealand 's population of 4.7 million is of European descent ; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority , followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders . Reflecting this , New Zealand 's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers , with recent broadening arising from increased immigration . The official languages are English , Māori and New Zealand Sign Language , with English predominant .   New Zealand is a developed country with a market economy . New Zealand is a World Bank high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance , such as health , education , economic freedom and quality of life . Nationally , legislative authority is vested in an elected , unicameral Parliament , while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet , led by the Prime Minister , who is currently John Key . Queen Elizabeth II is the country 's head of state and is represented by a Governor-General . In addition , New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes . The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau ( a dependent territory ) ; the Cook Islands and Niue ( self-governing states in free association with New Zealand ) ; and the Ross Dependency , which is New Zealand 's territorial claim in Antarctica . New Zealand is a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , Pacific Islands Forum , and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation .   Etymology   Dutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and called it Staten Landt , supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America . In 1645 , Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland . British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand .   Aotearoa ( often translated as `` land of the long white cloud '' ) is the current Māori name for New Zealand . It is unknown whether Māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans , with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island . Māori had several traditional names for the two main islands , including Te Ika-a-Māui ( the fish of Māui ) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu ( the waters of greenstone ) or Te Waka o Aoraki ( the canoe of Aoraki ) for the South Island . Early European maps labelled the islands North ( North Island ) , Middle ( South Island ) and South ( Stewart Island / Rakiura ) . In 1830 , maps began to use North and South to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 , this was the accepted norm . The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised , and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013 . This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui , and South Island or Te Waipounamu . Note that for each island , either its English or Māori name can be used , or both can be used together .   History"], [83, "World War II ( often abbreviated to WWII or WW2 ) , also known as the Second World War , was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945 , although related conflicts began earlier . It involved the vast majority of the world 's nations—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances : the Allies and the Axis . It was the most widespread war in history , and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries . In a state of `` total war '' , the major participants threw their entire economic , industrial , and scientific capabilities behind the war effort , erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources . Marked by mass deaths of civilians , including the Holocaust ( in which approximately 11 million people were killed ) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres ( in which approximately one million were killed , and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) , it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities . These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history .   The Empire of Japan aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific and was already at war with the Republic of China in 1937 , but the world war is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939 with the invasion of Poland by Germany and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by France and the United Kingdom . From late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan . Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 , Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours , Poland , Finland , Romania and the Baltic states . The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth , with campaigns including the North Africa and East Africa campaigns , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz bombing campaign , the Balkan Campaign as well as the long-running Battle of the Atlantic . In June 1941 , the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union , opening the largest land theatre of war in history , which trapped the major part of the Axis ' military forces into a war of attrition . In December 1941 , Japan attacked the United States and European territories in the Pacific Ocean , and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific .   The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway , near Hawaii , and Germany was defeated in North Africa and then , decisively , at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union . In 1943 , with a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front , the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of Italy which brought about Italian surrender , and Allied victories in the Pacific , the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts . In 1944 , the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France , while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies . During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma , while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key Western Pacific islands .   The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union , culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945 . Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms , the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively . With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent , the possibility of additional atomic bombings , and the Soviet Union 's declaration of war on Japan and invasion of Manchuria , Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945 . Thus ended the war in Asia , cementing the total victory of the Allies .   World War II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world . The United Nations ( UN ) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts . The victorious great powers—the United States , the Soviet Union , China , the United Kingdom , and France—became the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council ."], [84, "Alberta is a western province of Canada . With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1 , 2015 , it is Canada 's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada 's three prairie provinces . Its area is about . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1 , 1905 . The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015 .   Alberta is bounded by the provinces of British Columbia to the west and Saskatchewan to the east , the Northwest Territories to the north , and the U.S. state of Montana to the south . Alberta is one of three Canadian provinces and territories to border only a single U.S. state and one of only two landlocked provinces . It has a predominantly humid continental climate , with stark contrasts over a year but seasonal temperature average swings are smaller than to areas further east , due to winters being warmed by occasional chinook winds bringing sudden warming .   Alberta 's capital , Edmonton , is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada 's crude oil , oil sands ( Athabasca oil sands ) and other northern resource industries .   About 290 km south of the capital is Calgary , the largest city in Alberta . Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta 's two census metropolitan areas , both of which have populations exceeding one million , while the province has 16 census agglomerations . Tourist destinations in the province include Banff , Canmore , Drumheller , Jasper and Sylvan Lake .   Etymology   Alberta is named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta ( 1848–1939 ) , the fourth daughter of Victoria , Queen of Canada , and Albert , Prince Consort . Princess Louise was the wife of John Campbell , Marquess of Lorne , Governor General of Canada ( 1878–83 ) . Lake Louise and Mount Alberta were also named in her honour .   Geography   Alberta , with an area of 661848 km2 , is the fourth largest province after Quebec , Ontario , and British Columbia . To the south , the province borders on the 49th parallel north , separating it from the US state of Montana , while on the north the 60th parallel north divides it from the Northwest Territories . To the east , the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of Saskatchewan , while on the west its boundary with British Columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the Northwest Territories at 60°N until it reaches the Continental Divide at the Rocky Mountains , and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the Continental Divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the Montana border at 49°N .   The province extends 1223 km north to south and 660 km east to west at its maximum width . Its highest point is 3747 m at the summit of Mount Columbia in the Rocky Mountains along the southwest border , while its lowest point is 152 m on the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park in the northeast .   With the exception of the semi-arid steppe of the southeastern section , the province has adequate water resources . There are numerous rivers and lakes used for swimming , fishing and a range of water sports . There are three large lakes , Lake Claire ( 1436 km2 ) in Wood Buffalo National Park , Lesser Slave Lake ( 1168 km2 ) , and Lake Athabasca ( 7898 km2 ) which lies in both Alberta and Saskatchewan . The longest river in the province is the Athabasca River which travels 1538 km from the Columbia Icefield in the Rocky Mountains to Lake Athabasca . The largest river is the Peace River with an average flow of 2161 m3/s . The Peace River originates in the Rocky Mountains of northern British Columbia and flows through northern Alberta and into the Slave River , a tributary of the Mackenzie River .   Alberta 's capital city , Edmonton , is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province . It is the most northerly major city in Canada , and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern Canada . The region , with its proximity to Canada 's largest oil fields , has most of western Canada 's oil refinery capacity . Calgary is located approximately 280 km south of Edmonton and 240 km north of Montana , surrounded by extensive ranching country . Almost 75 % of the province 's population"], [85, "John R. `` Johnny '' Cash ( born J. R. Cash ; February 26 , 1932 – September 12 , 2003 ) was an American singer-songwriter , guitarist , actor , and author , who was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time , having sold more than 90 million records worldwide . Although primarily remembered as a country music icon , his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll , rockabilly , blues , folk , and gospel . This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music , Rock and Roll , and Gospel Music Halls of Fame .   Cash was known for his deep , calm bass-baritone voice , the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band , a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor , free prison concerts , and a trademark look , which earned him the nickname `` The Man in Black '' . He traditionally began his concerts with the simple `` Hello , I 'm Johnny Cash '' , followed by his signature `` Folsom Prison Blues '' .   Much of Cash 's music echoed themes of sorrow , moral tribulation and redemption , especially in the later stages of his career . His best-known songs included `` I Walk the Line '' , `` Folsom Prison Blues '' , `` Ring of Fire '' , `` Get Rhythm '' and `` Man in Black '' . He also recorded humorous numbers like `` One Piece at a Time '' and `` A Boy Named Sue '' ; a duet with his future wife , June Carter , called `` Jackson '' ( followed by many further duets after their marriage ) ; and railroad songs including `` Hey , Porter '' , `` Orange Blossom Special '' and `` Rock Island Line '' . During the last stage of his career , Cash covered songs by several late 20th century rock artists , most notably `` Hurt '' by Nine Inch Nails .   Early life and influences   Cash was born on February 26 , 1932 , in Kingsland , Arkansas , one of seven children born to Ray Cash ( May 13 , 1897 , Kingsland , Arkansas – December 23 , 1985 , Hendersonville , Tennessee ) and Carrie Cloveree ( née Rivers ; March 13 , 1904 , Rison , Arkansas – March 11 , 1991 , Hendersonville , Tennessee ) .  He was mostly of Scottish and English ancestry , and as an adult traced his surname to 11th-century Fife , Scotland , after meeting with the then-laird of Falkland , Fife , Major Michael Crichton-Stuart . Cash Loch and other locations in Fife bear the name of his family .   At birth , Cash was named J. R. Cash . When Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force , he was not permitted to use initials as a first name , so he changed his name to John R. Cash . In 1955 , when signing with Sun Records , he took Johnny Cash as his stage name .   The Cash children were : Roy , Margaret Louise , Jack , J. R. , Reba , Joanne , and Tommy . Tommy Cash also became a successful country artist . In March 1935 , when Cash was three years old , the family settled in Dyess , Arkansas . He started working in cotton fields at age five , singing along with his family while working . The family farm was flooded on at least two occasions , which later inspired him to write the song `` Five Feet High and Rising '' . His family 's economic and personal struggles during the Great Depression inspired many of his songs , especially those about other people facing similar difficulties .   Cash was very close to his older brother , Jack . In May 1944 , Jack was pulled into a whirling head saw in the mill where he worked and was almost cut in two . He suffered for over a week before he died on May 20 , 1944 , at age 15 . Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident . According to Cash : The Autobiography , his father was away that morning , but he and his mother , and Jack himself , all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day , causing his mother to urge Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother . Jack insisted on working ,"], [86, "Michaelmas , the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel ( also the Feast of Saints Michael , Gabriel , Uriel and Raphael , the Feast of the Archangels , or the Feast of Saint Michael and All Angels ) , is a day in the Western Christian liturgical year that occurs on 29 September . In medieval England , Michaelmas marked the ending and beginning of the husbandman 's year , George C. Homans observes : `` at that time harvest was over , and the bailiff or reeve of the manor would be making out the accounts for the year . ''   In Christianity , the Archangel Michael is the greatest of all the Archangels and is honored for defeating Satan in the war in heaven . He is one of the principal angelic warriors , seen as a protector against the dark of night , and the administrator of cosmic intelligence . Michaelmas has also delineated time and seasons for secular purposes as well , particularly in Britain and Ireland as one of the quarter days .   The Eastern Orthodox Churches do not observe Michaelmas , except the Serbian Orthodox Church . The Greek Orthodox honor the archangels on 8 November instead .   History   In the fifth century a basilica near Rome was dedicated in honour of Michael on 30 September , beginning with celebrations on the eve of that day , and 29 September is now kept in honour of Michael and all Angels throughout the western Church .   During the Middle Ages , Michaelmas , or the Feast of St. Michael , was celebrated as a Holy Day of Obligation , but this tradition was abolished in the 18th century . Lutheran Christians consider it a principal feast of Christ , and the Lutheran Confessor , Philip Melanchthon , wrote a hymn for the day that is still sung in Lutheran churches : `` Lord God to Thee We Give '' .   Because it falls near the equinox , it is associated in the northern hemisphere with the beginning of autumn and the shortening of days . It was also one of the English , Welsh and Irish quarter days when accounts had to be settled . On manors , it was the day when a reeve was elected from the peasants . Michaelmas hiring fairs were held at the end of September or beginning of October .   The name Michaelmas comes from a shortening of `` Michael 's Mass , '' in the same style as Christmas ( Christ 's Mass ) and Candlemas ( Candle Mass , the Mass where traditionally candles used throughout the year would be blessed ) .   Celebration   On the Isle of Skye , Scotland , a procession was held . Many of the activities that had been done at Lughnasadh – sports , games and horse races – migrated to this day . One of the few flowers left around at this time of year is the Michaelmas daisy . Hence the rhyme : `` The Michaelmas daisies , among dead weeds , Bloom for St Michael 's valorous deeds ... ''   Food   Traditional meal for the day includes goose ( a `` stubble-goose '' , i.e . one prepared around harvest time ) .   The custom of baking a special bread or cake , called Struan Micheil , St Michael 's bannock , or Michaelmas Bannock on the eve of the Feast of Saint Michael the Archangel probably originated in the Hebrides . The bread was made from equal parts of barley , oats , and rye without using any metal implements . In remembrance of absent friends or those who had died , special Struans , blessed at an early morning Mass , were given to the poor in their names . Nuts were traditionally cracked on Michaelmas Eve .   Folklore in the British Isles suggests that Michaelmas day is the last day that blackberries can be picked . It is said that when St. Michael expelled Lucifer , the devil , from heaven , he fell from the skies and landed in a prickly blackberry bush . Satan cursed the fruit , scorched them with his fiery breath , and stamped and spat on them , so that they would be unfit for eating . As it is considered ill-advised to eat them after 29 September , a Michaelmas pie is made from the last of the season .   Differences in number of archangels   In Anglican and Episcopal tradition , there are three or four archangels in its calendar for 29 September feast for St. Michael"], [87, "The Hillsborough disaster was a human crush at Hillsborough football stadium in Sheffield , England , on 15 April 1989 ; with 96 dead and 766 injured it is the worst disaster in British sporting history . It remains one of the world 's worst football disasters . It happened during the 1988–89 FA Cup semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest , being played at the neutral venue of Hillsborough , home ground of Sheffield Wednesday . The disaster resulted in a number of safety improvements in the largest football grounds , notably the elimination of standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadia , and the removal of spectator fencing , introduced to prevent pitch invasions . Initial investigations attached most of the blame to the police , but the coroner 's inquest ruled the deaths as accidental and no prosecutions followed . Aggrieved relatives launched a campaign for truth and justice , initially rebuffed , but eventually succeeding in gaining a new inquest verdict in 2016 , exonerating fans of any blame and recording a verdict of unlawful killing .   The crush occurred in the two central pens in the Leppings Lane stand , allocated to Liverpool fans ; in an attempt to ease overcrowding outside the entrance turnstiles shortly before kick-off , the police match commander chief superintendent David Duckenfield had ordered an exit gate to be opened , leading to a sudden influx of around 2,000 supporters through a tunnel leading to the central pens , trapping spectators already in the pens , with fences to their front and sides . With the kick-off due at 3 pm , the gate was opened 2:52 pm ; by 3:06 pm the game had been stopped .   Many of the myths about the disaster emerged in the following days , as police fed false stories to the press , resulting in the headline `` The Truth '' in the national tabloid newspaper The Sun . These persisted even after the Taylor Report of 1990 , which found the main reason for the disaster was a failure of control by South Yorkshire Police ( SYP ) , and that fans ' behaviour played no part in it . Despite Taylor criticising the police 's attempts to shift blame , the Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution against individuals or institutions . Families strongly rejected the coroner 's subsequent ruling , disagreeing with his decision not to examine events after 3.15 pm . New evidence claimed by controversial TV documentary Hillsborough in 1996 failed to convince authorities , with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith concluding in 1997 there was no justification for a new inquiry . Private prosecutions against Duckenfield and his deputy Bernard Murray failed in 2000 .   A turning point came in 2009 when government minister Andy Burnham was heckled during the 20th anniversary memorial ; it led to the formation of the Hillsborough Independent Panel to review all evidence . Reporting in 2012 , it confirmed Taylor 's criticisms , while also revealing new details around the extent of the police efforts to shift blame , the role of other emergency services , and the error of the coroner 's 3.15 pm cut off point . Two criminal investigations were then launched by police in 2012 , Operation Resolve to look into the causes , and an Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) to examine actions by police in the aftermath . The original inquest verdict was also quashed in 2012 , and a second one ran from 1 April 2014 to 26 April 2016 , the longest jury case in British history . It returned a verdict that the supporters were unlawfully killed due to grossly negligent failures by police and ambulance services to fulfil their duty of care to the supporters . The inquest also found that the design of the stadium contributed to the crush , and that supporters were not to blame for the dangerous conditions . For the actions of his force during the second inquest , the SYP chief constable David Crompton was suspended . Two days after the verdict , a private prosecution was brought on behalf of hundreds of relatives against both SYP and the West Midlands Police force ( who took statements from the SYP ) , alleging a concerted cover-up designed to shift blame away from the police .   Before the disaster   The venue   Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield , the home of Sheffield Wednesday , was selected by the Football Association ( FA ) as a neutral venue to host the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs . Kick-off was scheduled for 3:00"], [88, "John Sholto Douglas , 9th Marquess of Queensberry ( 20 July 1844 - 31 January 1900 ) was a Scottish nobleman , remembered for lending his name and patronage to the `` Marquess of Queensberry Rules '' that formed the basis of modern boxing and for his role in the downfall of author and playwright Oscar Wilde .   Biography   Douglas was born in Florence , Italy , the eldest son of Scottish Conservative Party politician Archibald , Viscount Drumlanrig and Caroline Margaret Clayton . He was briefly styled Viscount Drumlanrig following his father 's succession in 1856 , and on his father 's death in 1858 he inherited the Marquessate of Queensberry . The 9th Marquess was educated in the training ships Illustrious and Britannia at Portsmouth , and served in the Royal Navy until resigning in 1864 . He was Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 1st Dumfriesshire Rifle Volunteers from 1869 to 1871 .   In 1864 he entered Magdalene College , Cambridge , which he left two years later without taking a degree . He was more distinguished in sport , playing college cricket as well as running , hunting and steeplechasing . Article by John Davis .   He married Sibyl Montgomery in 1866 . They had four sons and a daughter ; his wife successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his adultery . She survived him to the age of 90 , dying in 1935 . The daughter , who became Lady Edith Gertrude Douglas , married the inventor St. George Lane Fox-Pitt . Queensberry married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year .   He died , two months after a stroke , and after a period of mental decline believed to be caused by syphilis , in his club room in Welbeck Street , west London , aged 55 , nearly a year before Oscar Wilde 's death . He wrote a poem starting with the words `` When I am dead cremate me . '' After cremation at Woking Crematorium his ashes were buried in Scotland in the family burial ground at Kinmount , Dumfriesshire .   In a surprising turn of events , for a man famed for his atheism and secularism , he apparently confessed his love for Christ and was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed , at his own request .   His eldest son and heir apparent was Francis , Viscount Drumlanrig , who was rumoured to have been engaged in a homosexual relationship with the Liberal Prime Minister , Archibald Primrose , 5th Earl of Rosebery . He died unmarried and without issue .   Douglas ' second son , Lord Percy Douglas ( 1868–1920 ) , succeeded to the peerage instead . Lord Alfred `` Bosie '' Douglas , the third son , was the close friend and lover of the famous author and poet Oscar Wilde . Queensberry 's efforts to end that relationship led to his famous dispute with Wilde .   Contributions to sports   Queensberry was a patron of sport and a noted boxing enthusiast . In 1866 he was one of the founders of the Amateur Athletic Club , now the Amateur Athletic Association of England , one of the first groups that did not require amateur athletes to belong to the upper-classes in order to compete . The following year the Club published a set of twelve rules for conducting boxing matches . The rules had been drawn up by John Graham Chambers but appeared under Queensberry 's sponsorship and are universally known as the `` Marquess of Queensberry rules '' .   A keen rider , Queensberry was also active in fox hunting and owned several successful race horses . As a rider his first winner was in the Dumfriesshire Hunt Club chase in 1865 , and his last was at Sandown Park in 1883 . He was Master of the Worcester Fox Hounds in 1870 . He was on the committee of the National Hunt but never won a Grand National as a rider , a last-minute substitution on the victorious `` Old Joe '' keeping him out of the 1886 National . During his riding career he recovered from a series of serious injuries .   Political career   In 1872 , Queensberry was chosen by the Peers of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords as a representative peer . He served as such until 1880 , when he was again nominated but refused to take the religious oath of allegiance to the Sovereign . Viewed by some as an outspoken atheist , he declared that he would not participate in"], [89, 'Fish are consumed as food by many species , including humans . It has been an important source of protein and other nutrients for humans throughout recorded history .   In culinary and fishery contexts , the term fish can also include shellfish , such as molluscs , crustaceans and echinoderms . English does not distinguish between fish as an animal and the food prepared from it , as it does with pig vs. pork or cow vs. beef . Some other languages do , as in the Spanish peces versus pescado . The modern English word for fish comes from the Old English word fisc ( plural : fiscas ) which was pronounced as it is today . English also has the term seafood , which covers fish found in the seas and oceans as well as other marine life used as food .   Species   Over 32,000 species of fish have been described , making them the most diverse group of vertebrates . In addition , there are many species of shellfish . However , only a small number of species are commonly eaten by humans .   Preparation   Fish can be prepared in a variety of ways . It can be uncooked ( raw ) ( cf . sashimi ) . It can be cured by marinating ( cf . ceviche ) , pickling ( cf . pickled herring ) , or smoking ( cf . smoked salmon ) . Or it can be cooked by baking , frying ( cf . fish and chips ) , grilling , poaching ( cf . court-bouillon ) , or steaming . Many of the preservation techniques used in different cultures have since become unnecessary but are still performed for their resulting taste and texture when consumed .   Nutritional value   `` Fish provides a good source of high quality protein and contains many vitamins and minerals . It may be classed as either whitefish , oily fish , or shellfish . Whitefish , such as haddock and seer , contain very little fat ( usually less than 1 % ) whereas oily fish , such as sardines , contain between 10-25 % . The latter , as a result of its high fat content , contain a range of fat-soluble vitamins ( A , D , E and K ) and essential fatty acids , all of which are vital for the healthy functioning of the body . `` Fellows P and Hampton A ( Eds . ) ( 1992 ) [ http : //www.fao.org/Wairdocs/X5434E/x5434e0f.htm # 11. % 20fish % 20and % 20fish % 20products Fish and fish products ] Chapter 11 in : Small-scale food processing - A guide for appropriate equipment Intermediate Technology Publications , FAO , Rome . ISBN 1 85339 108 5 .   Health benefits   Research over the past few decades has shown that the nutrients and minerals in fish , and particularly the omega-3 fatty acids found in pelagic fishes , are heart-friendly and can make improvements in brain development and reproduction . This has highlighted the role for fish in the functionality of the human body .   Health hazards   Fish is the most common food to obstruct the airway and cause choking . Choking on fish was responsible for about 4,500 reported accidents in the UK in 1998 .   Allergens   A seafood allergy is a hypersensitivity to an allergen which can be present in fish , and particularly in shellfish . This can result in an overreaction of the immune system and lead to severe physical symptoms . Most people who have a food allergy also have a seafood allergy . Allergic reactions can result from ingesting seafood , or by breathing in vapours from preparing or cooking seafood . The most severe seafood allergy reaction is anaphylaxis , an emergency requiring immediate attention . It is treated with epinephrine .   Biotoxins   Some species of fish , notably the puffer fugu used for sushi , and some kinds of shellfish , can result in serious poisoning if not prepared properly . These fish always contain these poisons as a defense against predators ; it is not present due to environmental circumstances . Particularly , fugu has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the national examination in Japan . Ciguatera poisoning can occur from eating larger fish from warm tropical waters , such as sea bass , grouper , and red snapper .

Retrieved 21 July 2012'], [90, "A prime number ( or a prime ) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself . A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number . For example , 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors , whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6 . The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory : any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering . The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization , e.g. , 3 , 1 · 3 , 1 · 1 · 3 , etc . are all valid factorizations of 3 .   The property of being prime ( or not ) is called primality . A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division . It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and \\sqrt { n } . Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers . These include the Miller–Rabin primality test , which is fast but has a small probability of error , and the AKS primality test , which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical . Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms , such as Mersenne numbers . , the largest known prime number has 22,338,618 decimal digits .   There are infinitely many primes , as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC . There is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers . However , the distribution of primes , that is to say , the statistical behaviour of primes in the large , can be modelled . The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem , proven at the end of the 19th century , which says that the probability that a given , randomly chosen number is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits , or to the logarithm of n .   Many questions regarding prime numbers remain open , such as Goldbach 's conjecture ( that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes ) , and the twin prime conjecture ( that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2 ) . Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory , focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers . Primes are used in several routines in information technology , such as public-key cryptography , which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors . Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains , mainly algebra , such as prime elements and prime ideals .   Definition and examples   A natural number ( i.e . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , etc . ) is called a prime number ( or a prime ) if it has exactly two positive divisors , 1 and the number itself . Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite .   Among the numbers 1 to 6 , the numbers 2 , 3 , and 5 are the prime numbers , while 1 , 4 , and 6 are not prime . 1 is excluded as a prime number , for reasons explained below . 2 is a prime number , since the only natural numbers dividing it are 1 and 2 . Next , 3 is prime , too : 1 and 3 do divide 3 without remainder , but 3 divided by 2 gives remainder 1 . Thus , 3 is prime . However , 4 is composite , since 2 is another number ( in addition to 1 and 4 ) dividing 4 without remainder :  4 = 2 · 2 .  5 is again prime : none of the numbers 2 , 3 , or 4 divide 5 . Next , 6 is divisible by 2 or 3 , since  6 = 2 · 3 .  Hence , 6 is not prime . The image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime : . No even number greater than 2 is prime because by"], [91, "Kelly Jones ( born 3 June 1974 ) is a Welsh singer-songwriter , guitarist and director and the lead singer of the band Stereophonics . Influenced by classic rock bands such as Pink Floyd , The Who , Led Zeppelin , AC/DC and Sex Pistols , Jones is noted for his raspy voice , which has been described as `` whiskey '' and has drawn criticism as well as acclaim . As a lyricist , Jones is influenced by Neil Young , Bob Catley , Steve Perry , Bob Dylan and Otis Redding .   History   Early life and début   Jones lived in the village of Cwmaman , near Aberdare , where he became friends with neighbours , Stuart Cable and Richard Jones and they formed a covers band together . Showing a talent for writing in his youth , he considered being a scriptwriter before being a musician and studied film at college . The BBC showed an interest in some of his early work but , as the band progressed from a cover band to writing their original material , he decided to use his narrative side more towards writing lyrics . Jones also flirted with the idea of boxing as a career and was a successful boxer at youth level . Much of his early life is documented in Stereophonics ' debut album , including his account of his teen years on a market stall . These are documented in `` More Life in a Tramps Vest '' from Stereophonics ' first album released in 1997 , Word Gets Around .   In 1999 Stereophonics were the first band to be signed to Richard Branson 's new Virgin Records label V2 . Their debut EP Looks Like Chaplin did not have enough copies made to enter the charts and their next single Local Boy in the Photograph was one place shy of making the UK Top 50 . However , their debut LP Word Gets Around did , however , make it to number 6 on the UK Albums Chart . Fellow Welsh band Manic Street Preachers put the band as support on their 1996-97 tour .   1998 - present : Mainstream success   In February 1998 , they received a Brit Award for Best New Group , the same week as a re-issue of Local Boy in the Photograph made number 14 in the charts and their first album went gold in the UK , selling over 100,000 copies . During that year Stereophonics had tours in Europe , Australia and the USA . They performed a concert on 12 June 1998 at Cardiff Castle . They performed a cover of the Randy Newman song Mama Told Me Not to Come with Tom Jones for his album Reload .   After another tour , they re-entered the studios and recorded Just Enough Education to Perform , containing the single Mr . Writer and Have a Nice Day , and Step on My Old Size Nines . A cover of Rod Stewart 's version of Mike D'Abo 's song Handbags & Gladrags was added to later editions of the album . They also recorded their biggest audience to date when they played to 80,000 in Slane Castle in Ireland and ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium , Cardiff , supported by Feeder and Ocean Colour Scene - who they had supported years before .   They released their fourth studio album You Got ta Go There to Come Back with songs like Maybe Tomorrow and Madame Helga and a re-worked song that had not been completed in time - Moviestar . They re-issued the album with this track included .   In 2002 , the band was chosen as a support act for Counting Crows and toured on various UK dates with the band . Subsequently Jones would join the band on stage and perform Mr. Jones and Hanginaround alongside Adam Duritz .   In 2003 , whilst on tour in Germany , drummer Stuart Cable - whom by this time had his own television chat show on BBC Wales - was sacked from the band by Jones , citing problems over `` commitment '' . Cable was replaced temporarily on the remainder of the tour by Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman . According to Stuart , `` I kept pluggin ' away . I knew when we started we were n't very good and I was waiting for it to get better . It was becoming obvious that was n't going to happen and I said so . Kelly did n't like that '' .

A nightclub is generally distinguished from bars , pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a dance floor and a DJ booth , where a DJ plays recorded music . The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night .   The music in nightclubs is either live bands or , more commonly , a mix of songs played by a DJ through a powerful PA system . Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres .   History   Early history   From about 1900 to 1920 , working class Americans would gather at honky tonks or juke joints to dance to music played on a piano or a jukebox . Webster Hall is credited as the first modern nightclub , being built in 1886 and starting off as a `` social hall '' , originally functioning as a home for dance and political activism events . During Prohibition in the United States , nightclubs went underground as illegal speakeasy bars , with Webster Hall staying open , with rumors circulating of Al Capone 's involvement and police bribery . With the repeal of Prohibition in February 1933 , nightclubs were revived , such as New York 's 21 Club , Copacabana , El Morocco , and the Stork Club . These nightclubs featured big bands ( there were no DJs ) .   In Germany , possibly the first discothèque was Scotch-Club . In Occupied France , jazz and bebop music , and the jitterbug dance were banned by the Nazis as decadent American influences , so as an act of French resistance , people met at hidden basements called discothèques where they danced to jazz and swing music , which was played on a single turntable when a jukebox was not available . These discothèques were also patronized by anti-Vichy youth called zazous . There were also underground discothèques in Nazi Germany patronized by anti-Nazi youth called the swing kids .   In Harlem , Connie 's Inn and the Cotton Club were popular venues for white audiences . Before 1953 and even some years thereafter , most bars and nightclubs used a jukebox or mostly live bands . In Paris , at a club named Whisky à Gogo , founded in 1947 , Régine in 1953 laid down a dance-floor , suspended coloured lights and replaced the jukebox with two turntables that she operated herself so there would be no breaks between the music . The Whisky à Gogo set into place the standard elements of the modern post World War II discothèque-style nightclub . At the end of the 1950s , several of the coffee bars in Soho introduced afternoon dancing and the most famous , at least on the continent , was Les Enfants Terribles at 93 Dean St . These original discothèques were nothing like the night clubs , as they were unlicensed and catered to a very young public—mostly made up of French and Italians working illegally , mostly in catering , to learn English as well as au pair girls from most of western Europe . In the early 1960s , Mark Birley opened a members-only discothèque nightclub , Annabel 's , in Berkeley Square , London . In 1962 , the Peppermint Lounge in New York City became popular and is the place where go-go dancing originated . However , the first rock and roll generation preferred rough and tumble bars and taverns to nightclubs , and the nightclub did not attain mainstream popularity until the 1970s disco era . Sybil Burton , former wife of actor Richard Burton , opened the `` Arthur '' discothèque in 1965 on East 54th Street in Manhattan on the site of the old El Morocco nightclub and it became the first , foremost and hottest disco in New York City through 1969.Time magazine .

During the early 1970s in New York City , disco clubs were places where oppressed or marginalized groups such as homosexuals , Blacks , Latinos , Italian-Americans , and Jews could party without following male to female dance protocol or exclusive club policies . It brought together people from all walks of life and backgrounds . These clubs acted as safe havens for homosexual partygoers to dance in peace and away"], [93, "In the Battle of Vimeiro ( 21 August 1808 ) the British under General Arthur Wellesley ( later known as the Duke of Wellington ) defeated the French under Major-General Jean-Andoche Junot near the village of Vimeiro , near Lisbon , Portugal during the Peninsular War . This battle put an end to the first French invasion of Portugal .   Four days after the Battle of Roliça , Wellesley 's army was attacked by a French army under General Junot near the village of Vimeiro . The battle began as a battle of manoeuvre , with French troops attempting to outflank the British left , but Wellesley was able to redeploy his army to face the assault . Meanwhile , Junot sent in two central columns but these were forced back by sustained volleys from troops in line . Soon afterwards , the flanking attack was beaten off and Junot retreated towards Torres Vedras having lost 2,000 men and 13 cannon , compared to 700 Anglo-Portuguese losses . No pursuit was attempted because Wellesley was superseded by Sir Harry Burrard and then Sir Hew Dalrymple ( one having arrived during the battle , the second soon after ) .   Prelude   After Roliça , Wellesley had established a position near Vimeiro . By holding the village , plus some ridges to the west , the British commander covered a beachhead at Maceira Bay a little further to the west . Since most of his reinforcements had arrived by 20 August , Wellesley planned to advance south on Lisbon . Eight independent infantry brigades under Rowland Hill , Ronald Fergusson , Miles Nightingall , Barnard Bowes , Catlin Craufurd , Henry Fane , Robert Anstruther and Wroth Acland formed the core of Wellesley 's forces . Rounding out his force were 17 cannons , 240 light cavalry led by C. D. Taylor and about 2,000 Portuguese troops under Nicholas Trant , giving a total of 20,000 men .   Junot organised his 14,000-man force into two infantry divisions and a cavalry division under Pierre Margaron . Henri François Delaborde 's infantry division contained two brigades under Antoine François Brenier and Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières , while Louis Henri Loison 's division included two brigades commanded by Jean-Baptiste Solignac and Hugues Charlot . In addition , François Étienne de Kellermann commanded a 2,100-man reserve made up of four converged grenadier battalions . These units were created by taking the grenadier company from each of Junot 's infantry battalions . The French took 23 cannons into battle with them .   Wellesley placed Anstruther 's and Fane 's brigades in front of Vimeiro , with Acland 's men in support . At first , his five remaining brigades held only the western ridge . Junot planned to send Thomieres , Solignac and Charlot 's infantry brigades to capture Vimeiro , while Brenier 's 4,300-man brigade and some dragoons swung in a wide flanking manoeuvre to seize an empty ridge to the northeast of the village . Wellesley detected Brenier 's move and switched Nightingall , Fergusson and Bowes to the northeastern ridge . Once Junot realised that British troops occupied the ridge , he sent Solignac 's brigade to the right to assist Brenier 's attack . The French commander decided to launch his attack on the town immediately , instead of waiting for his flanking move to develop .   Battle   All the preliminary moves and countermoves caused a series of uncoordinated French attacks . First , Thomieres ' 2,100-man brigade approached the British position . Supported by three cannons and screened by skirmishers , the brigade was formed into a column of companies .   The first company of 120 men formed in a three-deep line would have a front rank 40 men wide . All the other companies formed behind the first company , making the entire brigade about 40 files wide and 48 ranks deep . According to French doctrine , as soon as the enemy main position was found , the companies would peel off to the right or left to form a firing line many companies wide and only three files deep . On the other hand , French commanders often pressed home attacks while in column , depending entirely upon their skirmishers and artillery to provide the necessary fire support .   To counter the French skirmishers , Fane detached four companies of riflemen ( 60th Regiment of Foot & 95th Rifles ) . These outnumbered and outfought the French skirmishers , who fell back to the sides of the brigade column . Without their skirmishers in front of them , the French column blundered into the 945 men of the 50th Regiment ."], [94, "Margaret Hilda Thatcher , Baroness Thatcher , ( Roberts ; 13 October 1925 – 8 April 2013 ) was a British stateswoman and politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and the Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 . She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her the `` Iron Lady '' , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism .   Originally a research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election .   On moving into , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state-owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her re-election in 1983 .   Thatcher was re-elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge ( referred to as the `` poll tax '' ) was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher , of Kesteven in the county of Lincolnshire , which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to prerecord a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 . In 2013 , she died of another stroke in London at the age of 87 .   Early life and education   Thatcher was born Margaret Hilda Roberts on 13 October 1925 , in Grantham , Lincolnshire . Her father was Alfred Roberts , originally from Northamptonshire , and her mother was Beatrice Ethel ( née Stephenson ) from Lincolnshire . She spent her childhood in Grantham , where her father owned two grocery shops . She and her older sister Muriel ( 1921–2004 ) were raised in the flat above the larger of the two , on North Parade . Her father was active in local politics and the Methodist church , serving as an alderman and a local preacher , and brought up his daughter as a strict Wesleyan Methodist attending the Finkin Street Methodist Church . He came from a Liberal family but stood – as was then customary in local government – as an Independent . He was Mayor of Grantham in 1945–46 and lost his position as alderman in 1952 after the Labour Party won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950 .   Margaret Roberts attended Huntingtower Road Primary School and won a scholarship to Kesteven and Grantham Girls ' School . Her school reports showed hard work and continual improvement ; her extracurricular activities included the piano , field hockey , poetry recitals , swimming and walking . She was head girl in 1942–43 . In her upper sixth year she applied for a scholarship to study chemistry at Somerville College , Oxford , but she was initially rejected and was offered a place only after another candidate withdrew . Roberts arrived at Oxford in 1943 and graduated in 1947 with Second-Class Honours in the four-year Chemistry Bachelor of Science degree , specialising in X-ray crystallography under the supervision of Dorothy Hodgkin . Her dissertation was on the structure of the antibiotic gramicidin . Even while working on chemistry , she was already thinking towards law"], [95, "A torero or toureiro ( both from Latin taurarius , bullfighter ) , is the Spanish word for bullfighter and describes all the performers in the sport of bullfighting as practised in Spain , Portugal , Mexico , Peru , France and other countries influenced by Spanish culture . The performers who participate in the bullfight include : the main performer , who is the leader of an entourage and the one who kills the bull and is addressed as maestro ( master ) , or with the formal title matador de toros ( killer of bulls ) ; the other bullfighters in the entourage are called subalternos and their suits are embroidered in silver as opposed to the matador 's more-theatrical gold , and include picadores , rejoneadores , and banderilleros .   In English , a torero is sometimes called a toreador . The term does not exist in Spanish ; it was invented by Georges Bizet for his opera Carmen when needed the syllables of the word to match the timing of the song .   A very small number of women have been bullfighters on foot or on horseback ; one recent example is Cristina Sánchez . Female matadors have experienced considerable resistance and public hostility from aficionados and other matadors , perhaps being seen as a less physically nimble gender than the established norm .   Usually , toreros start fighting younger bulls ( novillos or , more informally in some Latin American countries , vaquillas ) , and are called novilleros . Fighting of mature bulls commences only after a special match , called `` the Alternative '' . At this same bullfight , the novillero ( junior bullfighter ) is presented to the crowd as a matador de toros .   The act of bullfighting is not called or considered a stand-alone sport but rather a performance art . There is no contest , simple punctuation , nor any formal classification . Further still , bullfighting , historically , started more with nobles upon horseback , all lancing bulls with accompanying commoners on foot doing helper jobs . As time went by , the work of the commoners on foot gained in importance up to the point whereupon they became the main and only act . Bullfighting on horseback became a separate and distinct act called `` rejoneo '' which is still performed today -- although , not as often as bullfighting itself does on foot .   Bullfighting on foot became a means for poor , able-bodied men to achieve fame and fortune , similar to the role of boxing in the United States . When a famous torero was asked why he risked his life , one man reportedly answered Más cornadas da el hambre ( `` [ There is ] more goring from hunger . `` ) . Today , it is now common for a bullfighter to be born into a family of bullfighters .   The established term , Maletilla or espontáneo , is attributed to those who illegally jump into the ring and attempt to bullfight for their sake and glory . While the practice itself is widely despised by many spectators and fans alike , some , such as El Cordobés , started their very careers this way .   Types   Matador de Toros   A matador de toros ( lit . `` killer of bulls '' , from Latin mactator , killer , slayer , from mactare , to slay ) is considered to be both an artist and an athlete , possessing great agility , grace , and co-ordination . One of the most famous matadors was Juan Belmonte ( 1892–1962 ) , whose technique in the ring revolutionized bullfighting and remains an established standard by which a great deal of bullfighters are judged . The style and bravery of the matador is regarded as being , at least , equally important as to whether or not he actually kills the bull . The most successful matadores used to be treated like pop stars , with matching financial incomes , cult followings and accompanied by lurid tabloid stories about their romantic conquests with women .   Currently , however , even today 's top matadors earn less , in real terms , than their peers did in the 1960s -- and much of mass media coverage is only limited to a handful of matadors known as the `` mediáticos '' , the sum of which do not necessarily include any of the nation 's prized bullfighters in Spain .   The great personal danger of bullfighting adds to the performing matador 's mystique ; matadores are regularly injured by bulls and ,"], [96, "Zumba is a dance fitness program created by Colombian dancer and choreographer Alberto `` Beto '' Perez during the 1990s .

Origin   In the mid 1990s , Alberto forgot his tape of aerobics music for a class he was teaching . He went to his car , listened to music – consisting of non-traditional salsa and merengue music – and improvised a class using this non-traditional aerobics music . After finding initial success in Phadke Road , he moved to the Ulhasnagar Sindhi Association ( USA ) in 2001 , where he teamed up with cofounder Alberto Perlman and a childhood friend , COO Alberto Aghion . The trio produced a demo reel , and the concept was discovered and licensed by a company called Fitness Quest to create a direct marketing campaign and a line of home videos .

Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey , guitarist Pete Townshend , bass guitarist John Entwistle , and drummer Keith Moon . They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century , selling over 100 million records worldwide and holding a reputation for their live shows and studio work .   The Who developed from an earlier group , the Detours , and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements , featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage . Their first single as the Who , `` I Ca n't Explain '' , reached the UK top ten , followed by a string of singles including `` My Generation '' , `` Substitute '' and `` Happy Jack '' . In 1967 , they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single `` I Can See for Miles '' , while touring extensively . The group 's fourth album , 1969 's rock opera Tommy , included the single `` Pinball Wizard '' and was a critical and commercial success . Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival , along with the live album Live at Leeds , cemented their reputation as a respected rock act . With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter and visionary Townshend , and the follow-up to Tommy , Lifehouse , was abandoned . Songs from the project made up 1971 's Who 's Next , which included the hit `` Wo n't Get Fooled Again '' . The group released the album Quadrophenia in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots , and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy in 1975 . They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976 . The release of Who Are You in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after .   Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed activity , releasing a film adaptation of Quadrophenia and the retrospective documentary The Kids Are Alright . After Townshend became weary of touring , the group split in 1982 . The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985 , a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of Quadrophenia in 1996–97 . They resumed regular touring in 1999 , with drummer Zak Starkey . After Entwistle 's death in 2002 , plans for a new album were delayed . Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who , releasing Endless Wire in 2006 , and continued to play live regularly .   The Who 's major contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall stack , large PA systems , use of the synthesizer , Entwistle and Moon 's lead playing styles , Townshend 's feedback and power chord guitar technique , and the development of the rock opera . They are cited as an influence by hard rock , punk rock and mod bands , and their songs still receive regular exposure .   History   Background   The founding members of the Who , Roger Daltrey , Pete Townshend and John Entwistle , grew up in Acton , London and went to Acton County Grammar School . Townshend 's father , Cliff , played saxophone and his mother , Betty , had sung in the entertainment division of the Royal Air Force during World War II , and both supported their son 's interest in rock and roll . Townshend and Entwistle became friends in their second year of Acton County , and formed a trad jazz group ; Entwistle also played French horn in the Middlesex Schools ' Symphony Orchestra . Both were interested in rock , and Townshend particularly admired Cliff Richard 's début single , `` Move It '' . Entwistle moved to guitar , but struggled with it due to his large fingers , and moved to bass on hearing the guitar work of Duane Eddy . He was unable to afford a bass and built one at home . After Acton County , Townshend attended Ealing Art College , a move he later described as profoundly influential on the course of the Who .   Daltrey , who was in the year above , had moved to Acton from Shepherd 's Bush , a more working-class area . He had trouble fitting in at the school , and discovered gangs and rock and roll . He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site . In 1959 he started the Detours , the band that was"], [98, "Para Handy , the anglicised Gaelic nickname of the fictional character Peter Macfarlane , is a character created by the journalist and writer Neil Munro in a series of stories published in the Glasgow Evening News between 1905 and 1923 under the pen name of Hugh Foulis .   Para Handy is the crafty Gaelic skipper of the Vital Spark , a Clyde puffer ( steamboat ) of the sort that delivered goods from Glasgow to Loch Fyne , the Hebrides , and the west coast highlands of Scotland in the early 20th century . The stories partly focus on his pride in his ship , `` the smertest boat in the tred '' which he considers to be of a class with the Clyde steamers , but mainly tell of the “ High Jinks ” the crew get up to on their travels . He had at least one crossover with Munro 's other popular character , Erchie MacPherson of Erchie , My Droll Friend . The name is an anglicisation of `` Para Shandaidh '' , which means `` Peter ( Paraig ) son of Sandy '' , and he is content to describe himself as `` Chust wan of Brutain 's hardy sons '' .   The other principal characters forming the four man crew include Dan Macphail the effete ( very subtly so ) engineer , Dougie the superstitious ship ’ s mate , The Tar ( real name Colin Turner ) the lazy deckhand , and The Tar 's replacement Sunny Jim ( real name Davie Green and cousin to the Tar ) , as the young squeezebox-playing deck hand . Also featured is Hurricane Jack ( real name John Maclachlan ) , Para Handy ’ s rather more outrageous adventurer friend . One inconsistency in the stories is that Dougie the mate has the choice of two surnames - Cameron or Campbell . Key points of friction among the crew are : transporting Ministers ( bad luck ) , transporting gravestones ( bad luck ) , the small boats carrying passengers across the Clyde in Glasgow called the Cluthas ( in Para Handy ’ s view , the lowest of the low in Clyde shipping ) , and Macphail ’ s taste for bodice-ripping women ’ s pulp fiction .   Stories   The stories are set in the Firth of Clyde , Loch Fyne and occasionally the Western Isles of Scotland . The stories are loved , partly for their very Scottish humour and also for their evocation of a lost era of the life of these coastal communities when they depended completely on the water and not , as now , on road transport and the ferry service . This is a time when Gaelic was still spoken by some as their native language and everyone in the community was known to all , for good or ill . The church ( the kirk ) was much more significant in community life and there is a lot of humour derived from scriptural misquotations which contemporary readers , with their thorough knowledge of the Bible , would have understood . Reference is also made to schisms in the kirk , with the same humour , which could sting those who were over serious in defence of their splinter denomination .   To the connoisseur these stories give an insight to the life and attitude of the Firth of Clyde , its tributary sea lochs and the city of Glasgow . They were written as occasional pieces in the `` Looker On '' column in the `` Glasgow Evening News '' and , as such were designed to be recognisable to Glaswegians with Highland backgrounds and also those who were city bred but regularly escaped the smoke to go `` doon the watter '' to the Clyde resorts of Rothesay , Millport , Dunoon and Tighnabruaich . The Vital spark also makes it to Arran and , notably , Loch Fyne which were more adventurous destinations but also accessible to city dwellers by the railway steamers which Para Handy so often envies .   Some of the stories were written over the period of the First World War and give insights into the 'home front ' of the time , casting it always in humorous light . This reveals the value of these popular pieces as sources which reflect the life of the community in the Edwardian and WW1 years in the area . Read alongside narrative history of the Western Front they reveal a poignancy . Many of these rural communities could be devastated by a single day 's action in the war , yet the stories were lighthearted . Nevertheless the stories remained popular .   Television"], [99, "The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin is a series of novels that developed into a British sitcom starring Leonard Rossiter in the title role . Both the books and television series were written by David Nobbs , and the screenplay for the first series was adapted by Nobbs from the novel , though subplots in the novel were considered too dark or risqué for television and toned down or omitted , an example being the relationship between Perrin 's daughter and his brother-in-law .   The story concerns a middle-aged middle manager , Reginald `` Reggie '' Perrin , who is driven to bizarre behaviour by the pointlessness of his job at Sunshine Desserts . The sitcom proved to be a subversion of others of the era , which were often based on bland middle-class suburban family life .   The first novel in the series , The Death of Reginald Perrin , was published in 1975 , with later editions retitled to match the title of the television series . Subsequent novels ( The Return of Reginald Perrin [ 1977 ] and The Better World of Reginald Perrin [ 1978 ] ) were written by Nobbs with the express goal of being adapted into the second and third television series , respectively ; Rossiter did not want to take the series forward unless it continued to be grounded in novels .   The original three television series , all of the same name , were broadcast between 1976 and 1979 ; a fourth , The Legacy of Reginald Perrin , also written by Nobbs , followed in 1996 .   Series summaries   Series One ( 8 September – 20 October 1976 )   The first series was based on Nobbs 's novel The Death of Reginald Perrin , retitled The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin to tie in with the television series . It still retains the replacement title .   Reginald Iolanthe Perrin is suffering a mid-life crisis , and tries to escape his dreary life . He lives at 12 Coleridge Close , part of the `` Poets Estate '' in a south London suburb called Climthorpe , a development different from those around it only by having the streets named after famous poets . He commutes to Sunshine Desserts where he works as a sales executive . Each morning he is 11 minutes late ( this increased to 17 then 22 minutes with subsequent series ) yet each morning he gives a different excuse . These become increasingly bizarre ( `` defective junction box , New Malden '' being one of the more plausible ones ; `` escaped puma at Chessington North '' being one of the least ) reflecting the decline of both British Rail and his own mental health . He enters the office building under the `` Sunshine Desserts '' sign which , as the series progresses , loses more and more letters .   `` Reggie '' , as he is known , daydreams in Walter Mitty style . Part of the narrative demonstrates what voices in his head are saying . Although he appears to love his wife , he fantasises about his secretary , Joan Greengross . As his behaviour becomes more erratic , he is unable to dictate letters without uttering words like `` breast '' . Far from being offended , Joan welcomes the attention , adjusting her posture to show her figure .   The endless marketing campaigns for bizarre products , satirised in reports from the product research department , combine with Reggie 's relations with his oppressive boss `` CJ '' and his yes-man subordinates to drive him over the edge . Ceasing to care about the consequences , he dictates offensive and condescending replies to customers .   At home things are no better . Despite his warm relationship with his wife Elizabeth he suffers from impotence . As pressures at work build , relations with his dysfunctional relatives deteriorate , especially with his incompetent brother-in-law Jimmy and son-in-law Tom , a man whose `` political correctness '' emphasises his pomposity . After a few reckless acts , including getting out of his car in the lion enclosure at a safari park , Reggie fakes his suicide by leaving clothes and personal effects on a beach . Before this he sends CJ an anonymous threat containing the words `` blood will flow '' , dumping loganberry essence into a stream while CJ is angling . CJ collapses and the company doctor , Doc Morrisey , pronounces him dead . CJ opens one eye and says , `` You 're fired !

St Blaise is the civil parish in which St Blazey is situated ; the name St Blaise is also used by the town council . The village of Biscovey and the settlements of St Blazey Gate , Bodelva and West Par lie within the parish boundaries . An electoral ward also exists in the name of St Blaise . The population at the 2011 census was 4,674 .  Once an important engineering centre for the local mine and railway industries , the parish is now dominated by the Eden Project .   St Blazey is situated 3 mi east of St Austell , 1 mi west of Tywardreath and 1 mi north of Par .   The town takes its name from the Armenian Saint Blaise and holds a procession and service on his feast day , 3 February .   History   An Iron Age hillfort Prideaux Castle lies a mile to the north west of the town in the parish of Luxulyan .   The Biscovey Stone is the shaft of an ancient Celtic cross . It was inscribed , but the text is no longer readable . There are several theories about the stone ; one says it dates from around 600 AD to show the Saxon advance into the county , another puts the date at around 900 AD . The head is thought to have been removed during the Reformation . The stone served as a gate post near the St Blazey turnpike gate . In 1896 it was moved to St Mary 's Church , Biscovey .   The church was built between 1440 and 1445 and is dedicated to Saint Blaise . It replaces an earlier church mentioned in 1294 . The parish was administered by Tywardreath Priory until the Reformation . It was split from St Austell parish in 1834 .  The site was originally known by the Cornish names Landrait or Landreath , meaning Church on the Sand .   Until the 16th century the valley below St Blazey was an estuary of the River Par and the St Blazey was the lowest crossing point on the river . Tin mining up river caused the estuary to silt up and it had become marsh land by the early 19th century . The Par Canal was built by Joseph Treffry between 1829 and 1835 ; it forms part of the boundary with the parish of Tywardreath and Par .   The town was once dominated by the local mining industries and their associated transport infrastructure . Historically copper and tin were mined in and around the parish , whilst more recently china clay has been the principal commodity mined . `` The Par & St Blazey Consols '' or `` South Prideaux Wood '' was a small tin mine just north of the town and Par Consols Mine lies to the south west . The more extensive Fowey Consols mine lies to the east near Tywardreath .   The port of Par Harbour , which lies within the parish , was developed to ease the transport of these minerals , and initially connected to the mines by the Par Canal . Whilst the port of Par is within the parish , the village of Par is actually just across the River Par , and hence lies in the civil parish of Tywardreath .   The Par Canal was soon replaced by the Cornwall Minerals Railway , which had a depot and station in the town , and still exists as part of the Atlantic Coast Line . Whilst St Blazey depot is still in use , St Blazey station closed to passengers in 1925 , and the town is now served by Par station on the Cornish Main Line in Par village .   Tourism   The Eden Project is located within the civil parish , and about a mile and half ( 2 km ) from the centre of the town . The large number of visitors this attracts has led to the development of tourism in the town . Other attractions , such as the Treffry Viaduct and the Luxulyan Valley , are also close by , although actually within the adjoining parish of Luxulyan .

The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata , on the continent 's southeastern coast . The meaning of Buenos Aires is clean air or good air . The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation , which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts , constitutes the third-largest conurbation in Latin America , with a population of around seventeen million .   The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province 's capital ; rather , it is an autonomous district . In 1880 , after decades of political infighting , Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province . The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores ; both are now neighborhoods of the city . The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy , hence its formal name : Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires ( Autonomous City of Buenos Aires ) . Its citizens first elected a chief of government ( i.e . mayor ) in 1996 ; before , the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic .   Buenos Aires is , along with Mexico City and São Paulo , one of the three Latin American cities considered an 'alpha city ' by the study GaWC5 . Buenos Aires ' quality of life was ranked 81st in the world and one of the best in Latin America in 2012 , with its per capita income among the three highest in the region . It is the most visited city in South America ( ahead of Rio de Janeiro ) and the second most visited city of Latin America ( behind Mexico City ) .   Buenos Aires is a top tourist destination , and is known for its European-style architecture and rich cultural life . Buenos Aires held the 1st Pan American Games in 1951 as well as hosting two venues in the 1978 FIFA World Cup . Buenos Aires will host the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics and the 2018 G20 summit .   Buenos Aires defines itself as a multicultural city , being home to multiple ethnic and religious groups . Also , several languages are spoken in the city in addition to Spanish , contributing to its culture and the dialect spoken in the city and in some other parts of the country . This is because in the last 150 years the city , and the country in general , has been a major recipient of millions of immigrants from all over the world , making it a melting pot where several ethnic groups live together and being considered as one of the most diverse cities in Latin America .   Etymology   It is recorded under the archives of Aragonese that Catalan missionaries and Jesuits arriving in Cagliari ( Sardinia ) under the Spanish Crown , after its capture from the Pisans in 1324 established their headquarters on top of a hill that overlooked the city . The hill was known to them as Buen Ayre ( or `` Bonaria '' in Sardinian language ) , as it was free of the foul smell prevalent in the old city ( the castle area ) , which is adjacent to swampland . During the siege of Cagliari , the Aragonese built a sanctuary to the Virgin Mary on top of the hill . In 1335 , King Alfonso the Gentle donated the church to the Mercedarians , who built an abbey that stands to this day . In the years after that , a story circulated , claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was retrieved from the sea after it miraculously helped to calm a storm in the Mediterranean Sea . The statue was placed in the abbey . Spanish sailors , especially Andalusians , venerated this image and frequently invoked the `` Fair Winds '' to aid them in their navigation and prevent shipwrecks . A sanctuary to the Virgin of Buen Ayre would be later erected in Seville .   In the first foundation of Buenos Aires , Spanish sailors arrived thankfully in the River de la Plata by the blessings of the `` Santa Maria de los Buenos Aires '' , the `` Holy Virgin Mary of the Good Winds '' who was said to have given them the good winds to reach the coast of what is today the modern city of Buenos Aires . Pedro de Mendoza called the city `` Holy Mary of the Fair Winds '' , a name suggested by the chaplain of Mendoza 's expedition - a"], [102, 'Herbaceous plants ( in botanical use frequently simply herbs ) are plants that have no persistent woody stem above ground . Herbaceous plants may be annuals , biennials or perennials .   Annual herbaceous plants die completely at the end of the growing season or when they have flowered and fruited , and they then grow again from seed .   Herbaceous perennial and biennial plants may have stems that die at the end of the growing season , but parts of the plant survive under or close to the ground from season to season ( for biennials , until the next growing season , when they flower and die ) . New growth develops from living tissues remaining on or under the ground , including roots , a caudex ( a thickened portion of the stem at ground level ) or various types of underground stems , such as bulbs , corms , stolons , rhizomes and tubers . Examples of herbaceous biennials include carrot , parsnip and common ragwort ; herbaceous perennials include potato , peony , hosta , mint , most ferns and most grasses . By contrast , non-herbaceous perennial plants are woody plants which have stems above ground that remain alive during the dormant season and grow shoots the next year from the above-ground parts – these include trees , shrubs and vines .   Some relatively fast-growing herbaceous plants ( especially annuals ) are pioneers , or early-successional species . Others form the main vegetation of many stable habitats , occurring for example in the ground layer of forests , or in naturally open habitats such as meadow , salt marsh or desert .   Some herbaceous plants can grow rather large , such as the Musa genus , to which the banana belongs .   The age of some herbaceous perennial plants can be determined by analyzing annual growth rings in the secondary root xylem , a method called herbchronology .'], [103, "Natural history is the research and study of organisms including animals , fungi and plants in their environment , leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study . It encompasses scientific research but is not limited to it , with articles nowadays more often published in science magazines than in academic journals . Grouped among the natural sciences , natural history is the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms . That is a very broad designation in a world filled with many narrowly focused disciplines . So while natural history dates historically from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the mediaeval Arabic world , through to European Renaissance naturalists working in near isolation , today 's field is more of a cross discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences . For example , geobiology has a strong multi-disciplinary nature combining scientists and scientific knowledge of many specialty sciences .   A person who studies natural history is known as a naturalist or natural historian .   Definitions   Pre-twentieth-century   The English term `` natural history '' is a translation of the Latin historia naturalis . Its meaning has narrowed progressively with time , while the meaning of the related term `` nature '' has widened ( see also History below ) . In antiquity , it covered essentially anything connected with nature or which used materials drawn from nature . For example , Pliny the Elder 's encyclopedia of this title , published circa 77 to 79 AD , covers astronomy , geography , man and his technology , medicine and superstition as well as animals and plants .   Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions : the humanities ( primarily what is now known as classics ) and divinity , with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment . The study of nature revived in the Renaissance , and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge , itself divided into descriptive natural history and natural philosophy , the analytical study of nature . In modern terms , natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern physics and chemistry , while natural history included the biological and geological sciences . The two were strongly associated . During the heyday of the gentleman scientists , many people contributed to both fields , and early papers in both were commonly read at professional science society meetings such as the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences – both founded during the seventeenth century .   Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives , such as Linnaeus ' aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden . Similarly , the Industrial Revolution prompted the development of geology to help find useful mineral deposits .   The astronomer , William Herschel was also a natural historian . Instead of working with plants or minerals he worked with the stars . He spent his time building telescopes to see the stars and the rest of the time watching the stars . In the beginning , he believed there to be an object known as a nebulae , but then later realized it was just another stage in star development . Herschel can be considered a natural historian because he observed the natural world and attempted to understand it . In the process he made charts of all the stars and kept records of all that he saw ( while his sister Caroline did all the documenting ) .   Post-nineteenth-century   Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources , and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field , creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them . For example , while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study , it can also be defined as a body of knowledge , and as a craft or a practice , in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed .   Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment , as seen in this definition by Marston Bates : `` Natural history is the study of animals and Plants – of organisms . ... I like to think , then , of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual – of what plants and animals do , how they react to each other and their environment , how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities '' and this more recent definition by D.S .

More broadly , `` the sea '' is the interconnected system of Earth 's salty , oceanic waters—considered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions . The sea moderates Earth 's climate and has important roles in the water cycle , carbon cycle , and nitrogen cycle . Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory , the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s . The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including the IHO 's four named oceans ( the Atlantic , Pacific , Indian , and Arctic ) and the Southern Ocean ; smaller , second-order sections , such as the Mediterranean , are known as seas .   Owing to the present state of continental drift , the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea ( a ratio of about 2:3 ) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic ( 1:4.7 ) .Reddy , M.P.M .

Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5 % by mass , although this can vary in more landlocked waters , near the mouths of large rivers , or at great depths . About 85 % of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride . Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature . Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides , the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun . The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth ( the Coriolis effect ) .   Former changes in the sea levels have left continental shelves , shallow areas in the sea close to land . These nutrient-rich waters teem with life , which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish , but also shellfish , mammals , and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed . The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs . Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales ' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting . Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters : even under enormous depths and pressures , nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem . Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth 's atmosphere ; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea .   The sea is an essential aspect of human trade , travel , mineral extraction , and power generation . This has also made it essential to warfare and left major cities exposed to earthquakes and volcanoes from nearby faults ; powerful tsunami waves ; and hurricanes , typhoons , and cyclones produced in the tropics . This importance and duality has affected human culture , from early sea gods to the epic poetry of Homer to the changes induced by the Columbian Exchange , from Viking funerals to Basho 's haikus to hyperrealist marine art , and inspiring music ranging from the shanties in The Complaynt of Scotland to Rimsky-Korsakov 's `` The Sea and Sinbad 's Ship '' to A-mei 's `` Listen to the Sea '' . It is the scene of leisure activities including swimming , diving , surfing , and sailing . However , population growth , industrialization , and intensive farming have all contributed to present-day marine pollution . Atmospheric carbon dioxide is being absorbed in increasing amounts , lowering its pH in a process known as ocean acidification . The shared nature of the sea has made overfishing an increasing problem .   Definition   Both senses of sea date to Old English ; the larger sense has required a definite article since Early Middle English . As the term has been applied over time , there are no sharp distinctions between seas and oceans , although seas are smaller and are—with the notable exception of the Sargasso Sea created by the North Atlantic Gyre—usually bounded by land on a smaller scale than multiple continents .

The eldest child of the Griffin family , Meg is the family 's black sheep who receives the least of their attention and bears the brunt of their abuse . She was originally voiced by Lacey Chabert during the first season . As of season two , she is voiced by actress Mila Kunis .   Personality   Meg is a self-conscious teenage girl . Her insecurities cause her desperately to try to be part of the cool crowd , but this only results in her getting coldly rebuffed by Connie D'Amico , the popular , attractive , and egotistical head cheerleader of her school . However , another student named Neil Goldman is attracted to her . She is also usually at the bottom of the family 's pecking order and the butt of Peter 's jokes due to her perceived homeliness , tendency toward social awkwardness , and unpopularity . Everyone in her family makes fun of her : Peter and Chris resort to outrageous stunts and names ; Stewie and Brian employ subtle but effective jokes ; Lois constantly puts Meg down while boosting her own egotistical image . On one occasion , the whole family even goes as far as to read her diary and make fun of all her deepest secrets . However , on some occasions the family 's true love for her has been proven . She has been so self-conscious and insecure about herself that she has engaged in dangerous sexual behavior just for attention . She is also prone to violent releases of her repressed rage , as shown in `` Road to Rupert '' , when she assaults a man who insulted her after a fender-bender . Many of the show 's story lines focusing on Meg involve her trying to struggle to fit in better with other more popular teenagers , trying to find a boyfriend , and reaching breaking points with her family , as well as other bullies .

The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera , in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s , the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season . The owners of the theatre , usually noble amateurs , charged the impresario with hiring a composer ( until the 1850s operas were expected to be new ) and the orchestra , singers , costumes and sets , all while assuming considerable financial risk . In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce Der Schauspieldirektor ( The Impresario ) . Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer ; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice , where his opera Orlando finto pazzo was followed by numerous others .   Alessandro Lanari ( 1787–1852 ) , who began as the owner of a shop that produced costumes , eliminated the middleman in a series of successful seasons he produced for the Teatro La Pergola , in Florence , which presented the premieres of the first version of Verdi 's Macbeth , two of Bellini 's operas and five of Donizetti 's , including Lucia di Lammermoor . Domenico Barbaia ( 1778–1841 ) began as a café waiter and made a fortune at La Scala , in Milan , where he was also in charge of the gambling operation and introduced roulette .   Modern use   The traditional term is still used in the entertainment industry to refer to a producer of concerts , tours and other events in music , opera , theatre and even rodeo . Important modern impresarios in the traditional sense include Thomas Beecham , Rudolf Bing , Sergei Diaghilev , Richard D'Oyly Carte , Fortune Gallo , Sol Hurok , Aaron Richmond , and jazz festival producer George Wein .   Application of term   The term is occasionally applied to others , such as independent art museum curators and conference organizers who have a leading role in orchestrating events .   Figurative impresarios   Jacques-Yves Cousteau said of himself that he was an impresario of scientists as an explorer and filmmaker who worked with scientists in underwater exploration . Nicholas Wade described James D. Watson and E. O. Wilson in The New York Times as impresarios of Charles Darwin 's works ."], [108, "Michael `` Mike '' Hammer is a fictional hard boiled detective created by the American author Mickey Spillane in the 1947 book I , the Jury .   Creation   In 1946 , Spillane , an established comic-book writer , worked with illustrator Mike Roy to create the private-eye character Mike Danger for proposed comic-book or comic-strip publication . Unable to sell the project as a comic , he reworked the story as the novel I , the Jury , converting Mike Danger to Mike Hammer and supporting character Holly to Velda . [ http : //www.toonopedia.com/mdanger.htm Mike Danger ] at Don Markstein 's Toonopedia . [ http : //www.webcitation.org/6friLo7Jb Archived ] from the original on March 8 , 2016 . Spillane wrote the work in nine days by some accounts , 19 in others .   Character   While pulp detectives such as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe are hard-boiled and cynical , Hammer is in many ways the archetypal `` hard man '' : brutally violent , and fueled by a genuine rage against violent crime that never afflicts Raymond Chandler 's or Dashiell Hammett 's heroes . In The Big Kill Hammer describes himself to a bargirl as a misanthrope . Hammer is also loosely based on the real-life hard-boiled Texas Ranger and gunfighter Frank Hamer , who was most famous for tracking down and killing Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker in 1934 .   While other hardboiled heroes bend and manipulate the law , Hammer often views it as an impediment to justice , the one virtue he holds in absolute esteem . Hammer nevertheless has a strong respect for the majority of police , realizing they have a difficult job and their hands are frequently tied by the law when trying to stop criminals .   Mike Hammer is a no-holds-barred private investigator who carries a .45 Colt M1911A1 in a shoulder harness under his left arm . His love for his secretary Velda is outweighed only by his willingness to kill a killer . Hammer 's best friend is Pat Chambers , Captain of Homicide NYPD . Hammer was a WWII army veteran who spent two years fighting jungle warfare in the Pacific theatre against Japan .  Hammer is also patriotic and anti-communist . The novels are peppered with remarks by Hammer supporting American troops in Korea , and in Survival ... Zero Vietnam . In One Lonely Night , where Hammer attends a communist meeting in a park , his reaction to the speaker 's propaganda is a sarcastic `` Yeah . ''   So far as violence is concerned , the Hammer novels leave little to the imagination . Written in the first person , Hammer describes his violent encounters with relish . In all but a few novels , Hammer 's victims are often left vomiting after a blow to the stomach or groin .   Mickey Spillane has said of his character : See , heroes never die . John Wayne is n't dead , Elvis is n't dead . Otherwise you do n't have a hero . You ca n't kill a hero . That 's why I never let him get older .   The Washington Times obituary of Spillane said of Hammer , `` In a manner similar to Clint Eastwood 's Dirty Harry , Hammer was a cynical loner contemptuous of the 'tedious process ' of the legal system , choosing instead to enforce the law on his own terms . `` [ http : //www.washtimes.com/national/20060717-105745-4982r.htm Washington Times - Mystery novelist Spillane dies ]   Novels   By Mickey Spillane   * I , the Jury ( 1947 )  * My Gun is Quick ( 1950 )  * Vengeance Is Mine !

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north , the Atlantic Ocean to the west , and the Mediterranean Sea to the south . To the east and southeast , Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains , the Ural River , the Caspian and Black Seas , and the waterways of the Turkish Straits . Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europe—a concept dating back to classical antiquity—are arbitrary ; the primarily physiographic term `` continent '' as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent 's current boundaries .   Europe is the world 's second-smallest continent by surface area , covering about or 2 % of the Earth 's surface and about 6.8 % of its land area . Of Europe 's approximately 50 countries , Russia is the largest and most populous , spanning 39 % of the continent and comprising 15 % of its population , while Vatican City is the smallest both in terms of area and population . Europe is the third-most populous continent after Asia and Africa , with a population of 739–743 million or about 11 % of the world 's population . Europe has a climate heavily affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent , even at latitudes along which the climate in Asia and North America is severe . Further from the Atlantic , seasonal differences are mildly greater than close to the coast .   Europe , in particular ancient Greece , is the birthplace of Western civilization . The fall of the Western Roman Empire , during the migration period , marked the end of ancient history and the beginning of an era known as the `` Middle Ages '' . The Renaissance humanism , exploration , art , and science led the `` old continent '' , and eventually the rest of the world , to the modern era . From this period onwards , Europe played a predominant role in global affairs . Between the 16th and 20th centuries , European nations controlled at various times the Americas , most of Africa , Oceania , and the majority of Asia .   The Industrial Revolution , which began in the United Kingdom at the end of the 18th century , gave rise to radical economic , cultural , and social change in Western Europe , and eventually the wider world . Both world wars were largely focused upon Europe , contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the United States and Soviet Union took prominence . During the Cold War , Europe was divided along the Iron Curtain between NATO in the west and the Warsaw Pact in the east , until the revolutions of 1989 and fall of the Berlin Wall .   European integration led to the formation of the European Union , a political entity that lies between a confederation and a federation . The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The currency of most countries of the European Union , the Euro , is the most commonly used among Europeans and the EU 's Schengen Area abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states .   Definition   Clickable map of Europe , showing one of the most commonly used continental boundaries Key : blue : states which straddle the border between Europe and Asia ;  green : states not geographically in Europe , but closely associated with the continent   The use of the term `` Europe '' has developed gradually throughout history . In antiquity , the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts , Europe , Asia , and Libya ( Africa ) , with the Nile and the River Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don , rather than the Phasis , as the boundary between Europe and Asia . Europe 's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don . The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons ; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar , separating it from North Africa , to the Don , separating it from Asia .

On December 11 , 2009 , Jay Z was ranked as the tenth-most successful artist of the 2000s by Billboard as well as the fifth top solo male artist and fourth top rapper behind Eminem , Nelly , and 50 Cent . He was also ranked the 88th greatest artist of all time by Rolling Stone .   Jay Z married American R & B singer Beyoncé in 2008 . They have a daughter named Blue Ivy Carter , born January 7 , 2012 .   Early life   Shawn Carter was born in Brooklyn , New York , and was raised in Marcy Houses , a housing project in Brooklyn 's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood . He and his three siblings were raised by their mother , Gloria Carter , after their father , Adness Reeves abandoned the family . At 33-years-old Jay Z met with Adnes and forgave him . Shortly after , in 2003 , Reeves died of liver failure . He claims in his lyrics that in 1982 , at the age of 12 , he shot his older brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry . Carter attended Eli Whitney High School in Brooklyn , along with future rapper AZ , until it was closed down . After that he attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School in Downtown Brooklyn , with fellow future rappers The Notorious B.I.G . and Busta Rhymes , and Trenton Central High School in Trenton , New Jersey , but did not graduate . In his music he refers to having been involved in selling crack cocaine . He has also said he had been shot at three times during this time in his life .   According to his mother , Carter used to wake up his siblings at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table . Eventually , she bought him a boom box for his birthday , sparking his interest in music . He began freestyling , writing lyrics , and followed the music of many artists popular at the time . In his neighborhood , Carter was known as `` Jazzy '' , a nickname that eventually developed into his showbiz/stage name , `` Jay-Z '' . The moniker is also an homage to his musical mentor , Jaz-O . On July 18 , 2013 , he announced he was leaving out the hyphen , and prefers to be known as `` Jay Z . ''   Jay Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O 's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s , including `` The Originators '' and `` Hawaiian Sophie '' . Jay Z was also involved in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early '90s . He first became known to a wide audience by being featured on the posse cut `` Show and Prove '' on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy 's Home .

It is the world 's second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue , after Comcast . Disney was founded on October 16 , 1923 , by Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio , and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production , television , and theme parks . The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio , then Walt Disney Productions . Taking on its current name in 1986 , it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater , radio , music , publishing , and online media .   In addition , Disney has since created corporate divisions in order to market more mature content than is typically associated with its flagship family-oriented brands . The company is best known for the products of its film studio , Walt Disney Studios , which is today one of the largest and best-known studios in American cinema . Disney 's other three main divisions are Walt Disney Parks and Resorts , Disney Media Networks , and Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media . Disney also owns and operates the ABC broadcast television network ; cable television networks such as Disney Channel , ESPN , A+E Networks , and Freeform ; publishing , merchandising , music , and theatre divisions ; and owns and licenses 14 theme parks around the world . The company has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since May 6 , 1991 . Mickey Mouse , an early and well-known cartoon creation of the company , is a primary symbol and mascot for Disney .   Corporate history   1923–28 : The silent era   In early 1923 , Kansas City , Missouri , animator Walt Disney created a short film entitled Alice 's Wonderland , which featured child actress Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters . After the bankruptcy in 1923 of his previous firm , Laugh-O-Gram Studios , Disney moved to Hollywood to join his brother , Roy O. Disney . Film distributor Margaret J. Winkler of M.J. Winkler Productions contacted Disney with plans to distribute a whole series of Alice Comedies purchased for $ 1,500 per reel with Disney as a production partner . Walt and Roy Disney formed Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio that same year . More animated films followed after Alice . In January 1926 , with the completion of the Disney studio on Hyperion Street , the Disney Brothers Studio 's name was changed to the Walt Disney Studio .   After the demise of the Alice comedies , Disney developed an all-cartoon series starring his first original character , Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , which was distributed by Winkler Pictures through Universal Pictures . The distributor owned Oswald , so Disney only made a few hundred dollars . Disney completed 26 Oswald shorts before losing the contract in February 1928 , due to a legal loophole , when Winkler 's husband Charles Mintz took over their distribution company . After failing to take over the Disney Studio , Mintz hired away four of Disney 's primary animators ( the exception being Ub Iwerks ) to start his own animation studio , Snappy Comedies .   1928–34 : Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies   In 1928 , to recover from the loss of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , Disney came up with the idea of a mouse character named Mortimer while on a train headed to California , drawing up a few simple drawings . The mouse was later renamed Mickey Mouse ( Disney 's wife , Lillian , disliked the sound of 'Mortimer Mouse ' ) and starred in several Disney produced films . Ub Iwerks refined Disney 's initial design of Mickey Mouse . Disney 's first sound film Steamboat Willie , a cartoon starring Mickey , was released on November 18 , 1928 through Pat Powers ' distribution company . It was the first Mickey Mouse sound cartoon released , but the third to be created , behind Plane Crazy and The Gallopin ' Gaucho . Steamboat Willie was an immediate smash hit , and its initial success was attributed not just to Mickey 's appeal as a character , but to the fact that it was the first cartoon to feature synchronized sound . Disney used Pat Powers ' Cinephone system , created by Powers using Lee De Forest 's Phonofilm system . Steamboat Willie premiered at B. S. Moss 's Colony Theater in"], [112, "A television licence or broadcast receiving licence is an official record of payment required in many countries for the reception of television broadcasts , or the possession of a television set where some broadcasts are funded in full or in part by the licence fee paid . The licence is sometimes also required to own a radio or receive radio broadcasts . A TV licence is therefore effectively a hypothecated tax for the purpose of funding public broadcasting , thus allowing public broadcasters to transmit television programmes without , or with only supplemental , funding from radio and television advertisements . However , in some cases the balance between public funding and advertisements is the opposite - the Polish TVP broadcaster receives more funds from advertisements than from its TV tax .   Whilst TV licensing is rare in the Americas , half of the countries in Asia , a few countries in Africa , and two-thirds of the countries in Europe use television licences to fund public television .   History   The early days of broadcasting presented broadcasters with the problem of how to raise funding for their services . Some countries adopted the advertising model , but many others adopted a compulsory public subscription model , with the subscription coming in the form of a broadcast licence paid by households owning a radio set ( and later , a TV set ) .   The UK was the first country to adopt the compulsory public subscription model with the licence fee money going to the BBC , which was formed on 1 January 1927 by Royal Charter to produce publicly funded programming yet remain independent from government , both managerially and financially . The licence was originally known as a wireless licence .   With the arrival of television some countries created a separate additional television licence , while others simply increased the radio licence fee to cover the additional cost of TV broadcasting , changing the licence 's name from `` radio licence '' to `` TV licence '' or `` receiver licence '' . Today most countries fund public radio broadcasting from the same licence fee that is used for television , although a few still have separate radio licences , or apply a lower or no fee at all for consumers who only have a radio . Some countries also have different fees for users with colour or monochrome TV . Many give discounts , or charge no fee , for elderly and/or disabled consumers .   Faced with the problem of licence fee evasion , some countries choose to fund public broadcasters directly from taxation or via other less avoidable methods such as a co-payment with electricity billing . National public broadcasters in some countries also carry supplemental advertising .   The Council of Europe created the European Convention on Transfrontier Television in 1989 that regulates among other things  advertising standards , time and the format of breaks , which also has an indirect effect on the usage of licensing . In 1993 , this treaty entered into force when it achieved 7 ratifications including 5 member states . It has since been acceded to by 34 countries , .   Television licences around the world   The Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago notes that two-thirds of the countries in Europe and half of the countries in Asia and Africa use television licences to fund public television . TV licensing is rare in the Americas , largely being confined to French overseas departments and British Overseas Territories .   In some countries , radio channels and broadcasters ' web sites are also funded by a radio receiver licence , giving access to radio and web services free of commercial advertising .   The actual cost and implementation of the television licence varies greatly from country to country . The rest of this section looks at the licence fee in a number of countries around the world .   Europe   Albania   The Albanian licence fee is 800 lekë ( €5.81 ) per year . However , the licence fee makes up only a small part of public broadcaster RTSh 's funding . RTSh is mainly funded directly from the government through taxes ( 58 % ) , the remaining 42 % comes from commercials and the licence fee .   Austria   In accordance with the Austria RGG ( TV and Radio Licence Law ) all broadcasting reception equipment in use or operational at a given location must be registered . The location of the equipment is taken to be places of residence or any other premises with a uniform purpose of use ."], [113, "Nuristan , also spelled Nurestan or Nooristan , ( Nuristani/Pashto : نورستان ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan , located in the eastern part of the country . It is divided into seven districts and has a population of about 140,900 . Parun serves as the provincial capital .   It was formerly known as Kafiristan ( , `` land of the infidels '' ) until the inhabitants were converted to Islam in 1895 , and thence the region has become known as Nuristan ( `` land of light '' ) .   The primary occupations are agriculture , animal husbandry , and day labor . Located on the southern slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains in the northeastern part of the country , Nuristan spans the basins of the Alingar , Pech , Landai Sin , and Kunar rivers . Nuristan is bordered on the south by Laghman and Kunar provinces , on the north by Badakhshan province , on the west by Panjshir province , and on the east by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Pakistan .   History   Early history   The surrounding area fell to Alexander the Great in 330 B.C . It later fell to Chandragupta Maurya . The Mauryas introduced Hinduism and Buddhism to the region , and were attempting to expand their empire to Central Asia until they faced local Greco-Bactrian forces . Seleucus is said to have reached a peace treaty with Chandragupta by giving control of the territory south of the Hindu Kush to the Mauryas upon intermarriage and 500 elephants .   Having consolidated power in the northwest , Chandragupta pushed east towards the Nanda Empire . Afghanistan 's significant ancient tangible and intangible Buddhist heritage is recorded through wide-ranging archeological finds , including religious and artistic remnants . Buddhist doctrines are reported to have reached as far as Balkh even during the life of the Buddha ( 563 BCE to 483 BCE ) , as recorded by Xuanzang .   The region was historically known as Kafiristan ( meaning `` Land of the kafirs '' ) because of its inhabitants : the Nuristani , an ethnically distinctive people who practiced a form of ancient Hinduism . It was conquered by Emir Abdur Rahman Khan in the late 19th century and the Nuristani people began converting to Islam .   British missionaries wrote :   The region was renamed Nuristan , meaning Land of the enlightened , a reflection of the `` enlightening '' of the pagan Nuristani by the `` light-giving '' of Islam .   Nuristan was once thought to have been a region through which Alexander the Great passed with a detachment of his army ; thus the folk legend that the Nuristani people are descendants of Alexander ( or `` his generals '' ) .   Abdul Wakil Khan Nuristani is one of the most prominent figures in Nuristan 's history . He fought against the British-led Punjabi army and drove them out of the eastern provinces of Afghanistan . He is buried on the same plateau where King Amanullah Khan is buried .   Recent history   Since the creation of Pakistan in 1947 , Afghan politicians ( particularly Mohammed Daoud Khan ) have been focusing on re-annexing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of what is now Pakistan . This has led to militancy on both sides of the Durand Line . In the meantime , Pakistani politicians have been focusing on connecting what is now Tajikistan with Pakistan . This requires weakening Afghan rule in Nuristan and Badakhshan provinces by secretly funding anti-Afghan rebel forces .   Nuristan was the scene of some of the heaviest guerrilla fightings during the 1980s Soviet war in Afghanistan . The province was influenced by Mawlawi Afzal 's Islamic Revolutionary State of Afghanistan , which was supported by Pakistan nationalists and Saudi Arabia . It dissolved under the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan ( Taliban rule ) in the late 1990s .   Nuristan is one of the poorest and most remote provinces of Afghanistan . Few NGO 's operate in Nuristan because of Taliban insurgency and lack of safe roads . The United States and the Afghan government are jointly working to solve these issues . Some road construction projects were launched linking Nangarej to Mandol and Chapa Dara to Titan Dara . The Afghan government also worked on a direct road route to Laghman province , in order to reduce dependence on the road through restive Kunar province to the rest of Afghanistan . Other road projects were started aimed at improving the primitive road from Kamdesh to Barg-i Matal , and from Nangalam in Kunar province"], [114, "Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire . It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture . The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror . Since the time of Henry I , it has been used by all monarchs , and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe . The castle 's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as `` a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste '' . Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St George 's Chapel , considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be `` one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic '' design .   Originally designed to protect Norman dominance around the outskirts of London and oversee a strategically important part of the River Thames , Windsor Castle was built as a motte-and-bailey , with three wards surrounding a central mound . Gradually replaced with stone fortifications , the castle withstood a prolonged siege during the First Barons ' War at the start of the 13th century . Henry III built a luxurious royal palace within the castle during the middle of the century , and Edward III went further , rebuilding the palace to make an even grander set of buildings in what would become `` the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England '' . Edward 's core design lasted through the Tudor period , during which Henry VIII and Elizabeth I made increasing use of the castle as a royal court and centre for diplomatic entertainment .   Windsor Castle survived the tumultuous period of the English Civil War , when it was used as a military headquarters for Parliamentary forces and a prison for Charles I . At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the help of the architect Hugh May , creating a set of extravagant Baroque interiors that are still admired . After a period of neglect during the 18th century , George III and George IV renovated and rebuilt Charles II 's palace at colossal expense , producing the current design of the State Apartments , full of Rococo , Gothic and Baroque furnishings . Queen Victoria made a few minor changes to the castle , which became the centre for royal entertainment for much of her reign . Windsor Castle was used as a refuge for the royal family during the Luftwaffe bombing campaigns of the Second World War and survived a fire in 1992 . It is a popular tourist attraction , a venue for hosting state visits , and the preferred weekend home of Elizabeth II . Today , more than 500 people live and work in Windsor Castle – the largest inhabited castle in the world .   Architecture   Windsor Castle occupies , and combines the features of a fortification , a palace , and a small town . The present-day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects , culminating in the reconstruction work after a fire in 1992 . It is in essence a Georgian and Victorian design based on a medieval structure , with Gothic features reinvented in a modern style . Since the 14th century , architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions , repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles . As a result , architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle 's architecture as having `` a certain fictive quality '' , the Picturesque and Gothic design generating `` a sense that a theatrical performance is being put on here '' , despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity . Although there has been some criticism , the castle 's architecture and history lends it a `` place amongst the greatest European palaces '' .   Middle Ward   At the heart of Windsor Castle is the Middle Ward , a bailey formed around the motte or artificial hill in the centre of the ward . The motte is 50 ft high and is made from chalk originally excavated from the surrounding ditch . The keep , called the Round Tower , on the top of the motte is based on an original 12th-century building , extended upwards in the early 19th century under architect Jeffry Wyatville by 30 ft ( 9 m ) to produce a more"], [115, "In the United States of America , Mexican Coke ( ) or , informally , `` MexiCoke '' , refers to Coca-Cola produced in and imported from Mexico .   Although intended for consumption in Mexico , Mexican Coca-Cola has become very popular in the United States because of a flavor that Coca-Cola fans call `` a lot more natural tasting '' . While many believe the primary difference in flavor between Mexican Coca-Cola and the American Coca-Cola formula is that Mexican Coke is sweetened using cane sugar as opposed to high-fructose corn syrup , a scientific analysis of Mexican Coke found no sucrose ( standard sugar ) in its sample of Mexican Coke , but instead found fructose and glucose levels similar to other soft drinks sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup . Coca-Cola claims that Mexican Coke exported to the United States is made with cane sugar , while some Mexican bottlers may use high-fructose corn syrup for drinks intended for sale in Mexico . Therefore , while Coca-Cola labeled `` Mexican '' in the U.S. is made with cane sugar , not all Coca-Cola sold in Mexico is .   History   Coca-Cola opened its first bottling franchise in Mexico in the 1920s with Grupo Tampico , and then Grupo ARMA . Monterrey-based FEMSA is currently the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico , along with most of Latin America .   In 2013 , a Mexican Coca-Cola bottler announced it would stop using cane sugar in favor of glucose-fructose syrup . It later clarified this change would not affect those bottles especially exported to the United States as `` Coca-Cola Nostalgia '' products .   Taste tests   Results from taste tests have been mixed . In a taste test conducted by a local Westchester , New York magazine , tasters noted that the Mexican Coke had `` a more complex flavor with an ineffable spicy and herbal note '' , and that it contained something `` that darkly hinted at root beer or old-fashioned sarsaparilla candies '' .   However , participants in a different double-blind taste test overwhelmingly preferred American Coca-Cola . Participants in taste tests conducted by Coca-Cola reported no perceptible differences in flavor between American Coke and the Mexican formulation .   Bottle   Mexican Coke is bottled in a thick 355 ml or 500 ml glass bottle , which some have described in contrast to the American Coke plastic bottles as being `` more elegant , with a pleasingly nostalgic shape '' . Instead of having a vinyl label wrapped around plastic , an enamel label is painted directly on the glass bottle . Most exporters of Mexican Coke affix a paper sticker containing the nutrition facts label , ingredients , and bottler and/or exporter 's contact information , to meet U.S. food labelling requirements .   U.S. availability   The World of Coca-Cola sells Mexican Coke in its gift store , and it is now widely available throughout the United States in stores and online .   New Zealand   A similar phenomenon exists in New Zealand , where Coca-Cola is available both bottled locally ( sweetened with sugar ) and imported from the United States ( with high-fructose corn syrup ) ."], [116, "World War I ( WWI or WW1 ) , also known as the First World War , or the Great War , was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918 . More than 70 million military personnel , including 60 million Europeans , were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history . Over 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians died as a result of the war ( including the victims of a number of genocides ) , a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents ' technological and industrial sophistication , and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare . It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history , and paved the way for major political changes , including revolutions in many of the nations involved .   The war drew in all the world 's economic great powers , assembled in two opposing alliances : the Allies ( based on the Triple Entente of the British Empire , France and the Russian Empire ) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary . Although Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary , it did not join the Central Powers , as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive , against the terms of the alliance . These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war : Italy , Japan and the United States joined the Allies , while the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers .   The trigger for the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary , by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 . This set off a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia , and entangled international alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked . Within weeks , the major powers were at war and the conflict soon spread around the world .   On 28 July , the Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia . As Russia mobilised in support of Serbia , Germany invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg before moving towards France , leading the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany . After the German march on Paris was halted , what became known as the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition , with a trench line that changed little until 1917 . On the Eastern Front , the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians , but the Germans stopped its invasion of East Prussia . In November 1914 , the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers , opening fronts in the Caucasus , Mesopotamia and the Sinai . In 1915 , Italy joined the Allies and Bulgaria joined the Central Power ; Romania joined the Allies in 1916 , as did the United States in 1917 .   The Russian government collapsed in March 1917 , and a revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers via the Treaty of Brest Litovsk , which was a massive German victory . After a stunning German offensive along the Western Front in the spring of 1918 , the Allies rallied and drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives . On 4 November 1918 , the Austro-Hungarian empire agreed to an armistice , and Germany , which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918 , ending the war in victory for the Allies .   By the end of the war , the German Empire , Russian Empire , Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist . National borders were redrawn , with several independent nations restored or created , and Germany 's colonies were parceled out among the winners . During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 , the Big Four ( Britain , France , the United States and Italy ) imposed their terms in a series of treaties . The League of Nations was formed with the aim of preventing any repetition of such a conflict . This effort failed , and economic depression , renewed European nationalism , weakened member states , and the German feeling of humiliation contributed to the rise of Nazism . These conditions eventually contributed to World War II .   Names   From the time of its start until the approach of World War II , the First World War was called simply the World War or the Great War and thereafter the First World War or World War I . At the time , it was also sometimes called `` the war to end war ''"], [117, "Mumbai ( ; also known as Bombay , the official name until 1995 ) is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra . It is the most populous city in India and the ninth most populous agglomeration in the world , with an estimated city population of 18.4 million . Along with the neighbouring regions of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region , it is one of the most populous urban regions in the world and the seсond most populous metropolitan area in India , with a population of 20.7 million . Mumbai lies on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour . In 2009 , Mumbai was named an alpha world city . It is also the wealthiest city in India , and has the highest GDP of any city in South , West , or Central Asia . Mumbai has the highest number of billionaires and millionaires among all cities in India .   The seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies . For centuries , the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese and subsequently to the British East India Company when in 1661 King Charles II married the Portuguese Catherine of Braganza , and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and seven islands of Bombay . During the mid-18th century , Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project , which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea . Along with construction of major roads and railways , the reclamation project , completed in 1845 , transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea . Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development . During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement . Upon India 's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State . In 1960 , following the Samyukta Maharashtra movement , a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital .   Mumbai is the financial , commercial and entertainment capital of India . It is also one of the world 's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow , generating 6.16 % of India 's GDP and accounting for 25 % of industrial output , 70 % of maritime trade in India ( Mumbai Port Trust and JNPT ) , and 70 % of capital transactions to India 's economy . The city houses important financial institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India , the Bombay Stock Exchange , the National Stock Exchange of India , the SEBI and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations . It is also home to some of India 's premier scientific and nuclear institutes like BARC , NPCL , IREL , TIFR , AERB , AECI , and the Department of Atomic Energy . The city also houses India 's Hindi ( Bollywood ) and Marathi film and television industry . Mumbai 's business opportunities , as well as its potential to offer a higher standard of living , attract migrants from all over India , making the city a melting pot of many communities and cultures .   Etymology   The name Mumbai is derived from Mumbā or Mahā-Ambā—the name of the patron goddess ( Kuladevi ) Mumbadevi of the native Agri , Koli and Somvanshi Kshatriya communities— and ā ' ī meaning `` mother '' in the Marathi language , which is the mother tongue of the kolis and the official language of Maharashtra .   The oldest known names for the city are Kakamuchee and Galajunkja ; these are sometimes still used . Ali Muhammad Khan , in the Mirat-i-Ahmedi ( 1507 ) referred to the city as Manbai . In 1508 , Portuguese writer Gaspar Correia used the name Bombaim , in his Lendas da Índia ( `` Legends of India '' ) . This name possibly originated as the Old Portuguese phrase bom baim , meaning `` good little bay '' , and Bombaim is still commonly used in Portuguese . In 1516 , Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa used the name Tana-Maiambu : Tana appears to refer to the adjoining town of Thane and Maiambu to Mumbadevi .   Other variations recorded in the 16th and the 17th centuries include : Mombayn ( 1525 ) , Bombay ( 1538 ) , Bombain ( 1552 ) , Bombaym ( 1552 ) , Monbaym ( 1554 ) , Mombaim ( 1563 ) , Mombaym ( 1644 ) , Bambaye ( 1666 ) , Bombaiim ( 1666 ) , Bombeye ( 1676"], [118, "Arches National Park is a US National Park in eastern Utah . The park is located on the Colorado River 4 mi north of Moab , Utah . It is known for containing over 2,000 natural sandstone arches , including the world-famous Delicate Arch , in addition to a variety of unique geological resources and formations .   The park is located just outside Moab , Utah , and is in area . Its highest elevation is 5653 ft at Elephant Butte , and its lowest elevation is 4085 ft at the visitor center . Forty-three arches are known to have collapsed since 1977 . The park receives 10 in of rain a year on average .   Administered by the National Park Service , the area was originally named a National Monument on April 12 , 1929 . It was redesignated as a National Park on November 12 , 1971 .   Geology   The national park lies atop an underground evaporite layer or salt bed , which is the main cause of the formation of the arches , spires , balanced rocks , sandstone fins , and eroded monoliths in the area . This salt bed is thousands of feet thick in places , and was deposited in the Paradox Basin of the Colorado Plateau some 300 million years ago when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated . Over millions of years , the salt bed was covered with debris eroded from the Uncompahgre Uplift to the northeast . During the Early Jurassic ( about 210 Ma ) desert conditions prevailed in the region and the vast Navajo Sandstone was deposited . An additional sequence of stream laid and windblown sediments , the Entrada Sandstone ( about 140 Ma ) , was deposited on top of the Navajo . Over 5000 feet ( 1500 m ) of younger sediments were deposited and have been mostly eroded away . Remnants of the cover exist in the area including exposures of the Cretaceous Mancos Shale . The arches of the area are developed mostly within the Entrada formation.Kiver , Eugene P. and David V. Harris , Geology of U. S. Parklands , Wiley , 5th ed. , 1999 p.503-515 ISBN 0-471-33218-6   The weight of this cover caused the salt bed below it to liquefy and thrust up layers of rock into salt domes . The evaporites of the area formed more unusual salt anticlines or linear regions of uplift . Faulting occurred and whole sections of rock subsided into the areas between the domes . In some places , they turned almost on edge . The result of one such 2500 ft displacement , the Moab Fault , is seen from the visitor center .   As this subsurface movement of salt shaped the landscape , erosion removed the younger rock layers from the surface . Except for isolated remnants , the major formations visible in the park today are the salmon-colored Entrada Sandstone , in which most of the arches form , and the buff-colored Navajo Sandstone . These are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park . Over time , water seeped into the surface cracks , joints , and folds of these layers . Ice formed in the fissures , expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock , breaking off bits and pieces . Winds later cleaned out the loose particles . A series of free-standing fins remained . Wind and water attacked these fins until , in some , the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out . Many damaged fins collapsed . Others , with the right degree of hardness and balance , survived despite their missing sections . These became the famous arches .   Although the park 's terrain appears rugged and durable , it is the exact opposite . More than 700,000 visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem . The problem lies within the soil 's crust which is composed of cyanobacteria , algae , fungi , and lichens that grow in the dusty parts of the park . Factors that make Arches National Park sensitive to visitor damage include : semiarid region , and the scarce , unpredictable rainfall , lack of deep freezing , and lack of plant litter which results in soils that have both a low resistance to , and slow recovery from , compressional forces such as foot traffic . Methods of indicating effects on the soil are cytophobic soil crust index , measuring of water infiltration , and t-tests that are used to compare the values from the undisturbed and disturbed areas .

Martin came to public notice in the 1960s as a writer for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour , and later as a frequent guest on The Tonight Show . In the 1970s , Martin performed his offbeat , absurdist comedy routines before packed houses on national tours . Since the 1980s , having branched away from stand-up comedy , Martin has become a successful actor , as well as an author , playwright , pianist and banjo player , eventually earning him an Emmy , Grammy and American Comedy awards , among other honors .   In 2004 , Comedy Central ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics . He was awarded an Honorary Academy Award at the Academy 's 5th Annual Governors Awards in 2013 .   While he has played banjo since an early age , and included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career , he has increasingly dedicated his career to music since the 2000s , acting less and spending much of his professional life playing banjo , recording , and touring with various bluegrass acts , including Earl Scruggs , with whom he won a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental Performance in 2002 . He released his first solo music album , The Crow : New Songs for the 5-String Banjo , in 2009 , for which he won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album .   Early life   Martin was born on August 14 , 1945 , in Waco , Texas , the son of Mary Lee ( née Stewart ; 1913–2002 ) and Glenn Vernon Martin ( 1914–1997 ) , a real estate salesman and aspiring actor . Martin was raised in Inglewood , California , and then later in Garden Grove , California , in a Baptist family . Martin was a cheerleader of Garden Grove High School . One of his earliest memories is of seeing his father , as an extra , serving drinks onstage at the Call Board Theatre on Melrose Place . During World War II , in England , Martin 's father had appeared in a production of Our Town with Raymond Massey . Expressing his affection through gifts of cars , bikes , etc. , Martin 's father was stern , and not emotionally open to his son . He was proud but critical , with Martin later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly ones of hatred . Martin 's first job was at Disneyland , selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during the school 's summer break . That lasted for three years ( 1955–58 ) . During his free time he frequented the Main Street Magic shop , where tricks were demonstrated to potential customers . By 1960 , he had mastered several of the tricks and illusions , and took a paying job at the Magic shop in Fantasyland in August . There he perfected his talents for magic , juggling , and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor Wally Boag , Martin ( 2007 ) p18–19 frequently performing for tips . In his authorized biography , close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could `` be described most accurately as an agnostic [ ... ] he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition '' .   Comedy   After high school graduation , Martin attended Santa Ana College , taking classes in drama and English poetry . In his free time , he teamed up with friend and Garden Grove High School classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre . He joined a comedy troupe at Knott 's Berry Farm . Later , he met budding actress Stormie Sherk , and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved . Sherk 's influence caused Martin to apply to the California State University , Long Beach , for enrollment with a major in Philosophy . Stormie enrolled at UCLA , about an hour 's drive north , and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives .   Inspired by his philosophy classes , Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor-comedian . His time at college changed his life . `` It changed what I believe and what I think about everything . I majored in philosophy . Something about non-sequiturs appealed to me . In philosophy , I started studying logic , and they were talking about cause"], [120, "Vatican City ( ; ; ) , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City ( ; ) , is a walled enclave within the city of Rome . With an area of approximately 44 hectares ( 110 acres ) , and a population of 842 , it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population .   It is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ( a type of theocracy ) ruled by the Bishop of Rome – the Pope . The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins . Since the return of the Popes from Avignon in 1377 , they have generally resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City , although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere .   Vatican City is distinct from the Holy See ( ) , which dates back to early Christianity and is the main episcopal see of 1.2 billion Latin and Eastern Catholic adherents around the globe . The independent city-state , on the other hand , came into existence in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy , which spoke of it as a new creation , not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States ( 756–1870 ) , which had previously encompassed much of central Italy . According to the terms of the treaty , the Holy See has `` full ownership , exclusive dominion , and sovereign authority and jurisdiction '' over the city-state .   Within Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter 's Basilica , the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican Museums . They feature some of the world 's most famous paintings and sculptures . The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by the sale of postage stamps and tourist mementos , fees for admission to museums , and the sale of publications .   Name   The name was first used in the Lateran Treaty , signed on 11 February 1929 , which established the modern city-state . The name is taken from Vatican Hill , the geographic location of the state . `` Vatican '' is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement , Vatica or Vaticum meaning garden , located in the general area the Romans called vaticanus ager , `` Vatican territory '' .   The official Italian name of the city is ' or , more formally , ' , meaning `` Vatican City State '' . Although the Holy See ( which is distinct from the Vatican City ) and the Catholic Church use Ecclesiastical Latin in official documents , the Vatican City officially uses Italian . The Latin name is ' ; this is used in official documents by not just the Holy See , but in most official Church and Papal documents .   History   Early history   The name `` Vatican '' was already in use in the time of the Roman Republic for a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome . Under the Roman Empire , many villas were constructed there , after Agrippina the Elder ( 14 BC – 18 October AD 33 ) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD . In AD 40 , her son , Emperor Caligula ( 31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41 ; r. 37–41 ) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers ( AD 40 ) that was later completed by Nero , the Circus Gaii et Neronis , usually called , simply , the Circus of Nero .   Even before the arrival of Christianity , it is supposed that this originally uninhabited part of Rome ( the ager vaticanus ) had long been considered sacred , or at least not available for habitation . A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby .   The particularly low quality of Vatican wine , even after the reclamation of the area , was commented on by the poet Martial ( 40 – between 102 and 104 AD ) . In AD 69 , the Year of the Four Emperors , when the northern army that brought Vitellius to power arrived in Rome , `` a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican , which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery ; and the Tiber being close by , the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed"], [121, "Easy Rider is a 1969 American road movie written by Peter Fonda , Dennis Hopper , and Terry Southern , produced by Fonda and directed by Hopper . It tells the story of two bikers ( played by Fonda and Hopper ) who travel through the American Southwest and South after selling a large score of cocaine . The success of Easy Rider helped spark the New Hollywood phase of filmmaking during the early 1970s . The film was added to the Library of Congress National Registry in 1998 .   A landmark counterculture film , and a `` touchstone for a generation '' that `` captured the national imagination '' , Easy Rider explores the societal landscape , issues , and tensions in the United States during the 1960s , such as the rise and fall of the hippie movement , drug use , and communal lifestyle .  In Easy Rider , real drugs were used in scenes showing the use of marijuana and other substances .   Plot   The protagonists are two freewheeling guys : Wyatt ( Fonda ) , nicknamed `` Captain America '' , and Billy ( Hopper ) . Fonda and Hopper have said that these characters ' names refer to Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kid . Wyatt dresses in American flag-adorned leather ( with an Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge affixed to it ) , while Billy dresses in Native American-style buckskin pants and shirts and a bushman hat . The former is quite open to people they meet on their journey and accepting of help while the latter is more hostile and suspicious .   After smuggling cocaine from Mexico to Los Angeles , Wyatt and Billy sell their haul to `` Connection '' , a man ( played by Phil Spector ) in a Rolls-Royce , and receive a large sum in return . With the money stuffed into a plastic tube hidden inside the Stars & Stripes-painted fuel tank of Wyatt 's California-style chopper , they ride eastward aiming to reach New Orleans , Louisiana , in time for the Mardi Gras festival .   During their trip Wyatt and Billy stop to repair one of the bikes at a farmstead , and have a meal with the farmer ( Warren Finnerty ) and his family . Wyatt seems to appreciate the simple , traditional lifestyle presented here . Later Wyatt stops to pick up a hippyish hitch-hiker ( Luke Askew ) and he invites them to visit his commune , where they stay for the rest of the day . Life in the commune appears to be hard , with young hippies from the city struggling to grow their own crops in a dry climate with poor soil and little rainfall . ( One of the children seen in the commune is played by Fonda 's four-year-old daughter Bridget . ) At one point , the bikers witness a prayer for blessing of the new crop , as put by a commune-member ( Robert Walker Jr. ) : A chance `` to make a stand '' , and to plant `` simple food , for our simple taste '' . The commune is also hosting a traveling theater group that `` sings for its supper '' ( performs for food ) . The notion of `` free love '' appears to be practiced , with two of the women , Lisa ( Luana Anders ) and Sarah ( Sabrina Scharf ) , seemingly sharing the affections of the hitch-hiking commune-member before turning their attention to Wyatt and Billy . The hitch-hiker asks the two bikers to stay at the commune , saying , `` the time is now '' , to which Wyatt replies `` I 'm hip about time ... but I just got ta go . '' As the bikers leave , the hitch-hiker ( known only as `` Stranger on highway '' in the credits ) gives Wyatt some LSD for him to share with `` the right people '' .   Later , while naughtily riding along with a parade in a small town , the pair are arrested by the local authorities for `` parading without a permit '' and thrown in jail . There , they befriend American Civil Liberties Union lawyer and local drunk George Hanson ( Jack Nicholson ) , who has spent the night in jail after overindulging in alcohol . George helps them get out of jail and decides to travel with Wyatt and Billy to New Orleans . As they camp that night , Wyatt and Billy introduce George to marijuana .

He is the only British prime minister to have been assassinated . He is also the only solicitor general or attorney general to have been prime minister , and the only prime minister whose entire lifetime was spent in the reign of the sovereign under which he held office , George III ( who had become king in 1760 and survived Perceval to 1820 ) .   The younger son of an Irish earl , Perceval was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College , Cambridge . He studied law at Lincoln ’ s Inn , practised as a barrister on the Midland circuit and in 1796 became a King ’ s Counsel before entering politics at the age of 33 as a Member of Parliament for Northampton . A follower of William Pitt , Perceval always described himself as a `` friend of Mr Pitt '' rather than a Tory . Perceval was opposed to Catholic emancipation and reform of Parliament ; he supported the war against Napoleon and the abolition of the slave trade . He was opposed to hunting , gambling and adultery , did not drink as much as most Members of Parliament , gave generously to charity , and enjoyed spending time with his twelve children .   After a late entry into politics , his rise to power was rapid ; he was solicitor and then attorney general in the Addington Ministry , Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons in the Portland Ministry , and became prime minister in October 1809 . At the head of a weak ministry , Perceval faced a number of crises during his term in office including an inquiry into the Walcheren expedition , the madness of King George III , economic depression and Luddite riots . He overcame these crises , successfully pursued the Peninsular War in the face of opposition defeatism , and won the support of the Prince Regent . His position was looking stronger by the spring of 1812 , when he was assassinated by John Bellingham , a merchant with a grievance against the government , who shot him dead in the lobby of the House of Commons .   Although Perceval was a seventh son and had four older brothers who survived to adulthood , the Earldom of Egmont reverted to one of his great-grandsons in the early 20th century and remained in the hands of his descendants until its extinction in 2011 .   Childhood and education   Perceval was born in Audley Square , Mayfair , the seventh son of John Perceval , 2nd Earl of Egmont ; he was the second son of the Earl ’ s second marriage . His mother , Catherine Compton , Baroness Arden , was a granddaughter of the 4th Earl of Northampton . Spencer was a Compton family name ; Catherine Compton 's great uncle Spencer Compton , 1st Earl of Wilmington , had been prime minister .   His father , a political advisor to Frederick , Prince of Wales and King George III , served briefly in the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty . Perceval ’ s early childhood was spent at Charlton House , which his father had taken to be near Woolwich docks .   Perceval ’ s father died when he was eight . Perceval went to Harrow School , where he was a disciplined and hard-working pupil . It was at Harrow that he developed an interest in evangelical Anglicanism and formed what was to be a lifelong friendship with Dudley Ryder . After five years at Harrow he followed his older brother Charles to Trinity College , Cambridge , where he won the declamation prize in English and graduated in 1782 .   Legal career and marriage   As the second son of a second marriage , and with an allowance of only £200 a year ( equivalent to about £28,000 in 2014 ) , Perceval faced the prospect of having to make his own way in life . He chose the law as a profession , studied at Lincoln ’ s Inn , and was called to the bar in 1786 . Perceval ’ s mother had died in 1783 , and Perceval and his brother Charles , now Lord Arden , rented a house in Charlton , where they fell in love with two sisters who were living in the Percevals ' old childhood home . The sisters ’ father , Sir Thomas Spencer Wilson , approved"], [123, "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a novella by the Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson first published in 1886 . The work is commonly known today as The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , or simply Jekyll & Hyde . It is about a London lawyer named Gabriel John Utterson who investigates strange occurrences between his old friend , Dr. Henry Jekyll , and the evil Edward Hyde . The novella 's impact is such that it has become a part of the language , with the very phrase `` Jekyll and Hyde '' coming to mean a person who is vastly different in moral character from one situation to the next .   There have been many audio recordings of the novella , with some of the more famous readers including Tom Baker , Roger Rees , Christopher Lee , Anthony Quayle , Martin Jarvis , Tim Pigott-Smith , John Hurt , Ian Holm and Gene Lockhart .   Inspiration and writing   Stevenson had long been intrigued by the idea of how personalities can affect a human and how to incorporate the interplay of good and evil into a story . While still a teenager , he developed a script for a play about Deacon Brodie , which he later reworked with the help of W. E. Henley and was produced for the first time in 1882 . In early 1884 he wrote the short story `` Markheim '' , which he revised in 1884 for publication in a Christmas annual . One night in late September or early October 1885 , possibly while he was still revising `` Markheim , '' Stevenson had a dream , and upon wakening had the intuition for two or three scenes that would appear in the story . Biographer Graham Balfour quoted Stevenson 's wife Fanny Stevenson : In the small hours of one morning , [ ... ] I was awakened by cries of horror from Louis . Thinking he had a nightmare , I awakened him . He said angrily : `` Why did you wake me ? I was dreaming a fine bogey tale . '' I had awakened him at the first transformation scene .   Lloyd Osbourne , Stevenson 's stepson , wrote : `` I do n't believe that there was ever such a literary feat before as the writing of Dr Jekyll . I remember the first disease of the world though it were yesterday . Louis came downstairs in a fever ; read nearly half the book aloud ; and then , while we were still gasping , he was away again , and busy writing . I doubt if the first draft took so long as three days . ''   Louis Vivet , a mental patient who was suffering from split-personality disorder , caught Stevenson 's inspiration while developing the story . As was customary , Mrs Stevenson would read the draft and offer her criticisms in the margins . Louis was confined to bed at the time from a haemorrhage . Therefore , she left her comments with the manuscript and Louis in the toilet . She said that in effect the story was really an allegory , but Louis was writing it as a story . After a while Louis called her back into the bedroom and pointed to a pile of ashes : he had burnt the manuscript in fear that he would try to salvage it , and in the process forced himself to start again from nothing , writing an allegorical story as she had suggested . Scholars debate whether he really burnt his manuscript ; there is no direct factual evidence for the burning , but it remains an integral part of the history of the novella .   Stevenson re-wrote the story in three to six days . A number of later biographers have alleged that Stevenson was on drugs during the frantic re-write ; for example , William Gray 's revisionist history A Literary Life ( 2004 ) said he used cocaine , while other biographers said he used ergot . However , the standard history , according to the accounts of his wife and son ( and himself ) , says he was bed-ridden and sick while writing it . According to Osbourne , `` The mere physical feat was tremendous and , instead of harming him , it roused and cheered him inexpressibly '' . He continued to refine the work for four to six weeks after the initial re-write . The novella was written in the southern English sea side town of Bournemouth , where Stevenson had moved due to ill health"], [124, "Australia ( officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia ) is a federation of six states , together with ten federal territories . The Australian mainland consists of five of the six federated statesthe state of Tasmania is an island in close proximity to the mainlandand three of the federal territories . Aside from the Australian Antarctic Territory , which is Australia 's claim to part of Antarctica , Australia is the world 's sixth-largest country by total area .   The three mainland territories are classified for some purposes as `` internal '' territories , the others as `` external '' territories . All states and the two largest internal territories are partially self-governing , as well as being represented in the federal parliament ; the other territories are administered by the federal government . Since 2015 , federal control has also been extended to the formerly self-governing territory of Norfolk Island . Three of the external territories are inhabited ; the others are uninhabited , apart from non-permanent scientists .   Geographic Australia   The term geographic Australia is used by the Australian government to describe the area covered by demographic statistics such as national population figures . This area comprises Christmas Island and the Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands in addition to the six states and three mainland territories . Norfolk Island is the only territory with a native population that is not part of geographic Australia .   External territories , states and territories   See also : List of State codes   Australia has had three now-defunct territories in its history :   * From 1926 to 1931 , the Northern Territory was divided into Central Australia and North Australia , with the border at the 20th parallel south . Both territories were reincorporated as the Northern Territory at the end of this period .  * From 1949 to 1975 , the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was a territory of Australia , remaining so until the independence of the country of Papua New Guinea .   Background and overview   The states originated as separate British colonies prior to Federation in 1901 . The Colony of New South Wales was founded in 1788 and originally comprised much of the Australian mainland , as well as Lord Howe Island , New Zealand , Norfolk Island , and Van Diemen 's Land , in addition to the area currently referred to as the state of New South Wales . During the 19th century , large areas were successively separated to form the Colony of Tasmania ( initially established as a separate colony named Van Diemen 's Land in 1825 ) , the Colony of Western Australia ( initially established as the smaller Swan River Colony in 1829 ) , the Province of South Australia ( 1836 ) , the Colony of New Zealand ( 1840 ) , the Victoria Colony ( 1851 ) and the Colony of Queensland ( 1859 ) . Upon Federation , the six colonies of New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland , South Australia , Western Australia , and Tasmania became the founding states of the new Commonwealth of Australia .   Legislative powers of the states are protected by the Australian constitution , section 107 , and under the principle of federalism Commonwealth legislation only applies to the states where permitted by the constitution . The territories , by contrast , are from a constitutional perspective directly subject to the Commonwealth Government . The Australian Parliament has power to legislate in the territories that it does not possess in the states : Constitution section 122 .   Most of the territories are directly administered by the Commonwealth Government , while two ( the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory ) have some degree of self-government although less than that of the states . In the self-governing territories , the Australian Parliament retains the full power to legislate , and can override laws made by the territorial institutions , which it has done on rare occasions . For the purposes of Australian ( and joint Australia-New Zealand ) intergovernmental bodies , the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are treated as if they were states .   Each state has a Governor , appointed by the Queen , which by convention she does on the advice of the state Premier . The Administrator of the Northern Territory , by contrast , is appointed by the Governor-General . The Australian Capital Territory has neither a Governor nor an Administrator , but the Governor-General exercises some powers that in other jurisdictions are exercised by the Governor of a state or Administrator of a territory , such as"], [125, "Cornwall ( or ; , ) is a ceremonial county and unitary authority area of England within the United Kingdom . It is bordered to the north and west by the Celtic Sea , to the south by the English Channel , and to the east by the county of Devon , over the River Tamar . Cornwall has a population of and covers an area of 3563 km2 . The administrative centre , and only city in Cornwall , is Truro , although the town of Falmouth has the largest population for a civil parish and the conurbation of Camborne , Pool and Redruth has the highest total population .   Cornwall forms the westernmost part of the south-west peninsula of the island of Great Britain , and a large part of the Cornubian batholith is within Cornwall . This area was first inhabited in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods . It continued to be occupied by Neolithic and then Bronze Age peoples , and later ( in the Iron Age ) by Brythons with distinctive cultural relations to neighbouring Wales and Brittany . There is little evidence that Roman rule was effective west of Exeter and few Roman remains have been found . Cornwall was the home of a division of the Dumnonii tribe – whose tribal centre was in the modern county of Devon – known as the Cornovii , separated from the Brythons of Wales after the Battle of Deorham , often coming into conflict with the expanding kingdom of Wessex before King Athelstan in AD 936 set the boundary between English and Cornish at the high water mark of the eastern bank of the River Tamar . From the early Middle Ages , British language and culture was apparently shared by Brythons trading across both sides of the Channel , evidenced by the corresponding high medieval Breton kingdoms of Domnonée and Cornouaille and the Celtic Christianity common to both territories .   Historically tin mining was important in the Cornish economy , becoming increasingly significant during the High Middle Ages and expanding greatly during the 19th century when rich copper mines were also in production . In the mid-19th century , however , the tin and copper mines entered a period of decline . Subsequently china clay extraction became more important and metal mining had virtually ended by the 1990s . Traditionally , fishing ( particularly of pilchards ) and agriculture ( notably dairy products and vegetables ) were the other important sectors of the economy . Railways led to a growth of tourism in the 20th century ; however , Cornwall 's economy struggled after the decline of the mining and fishing industries . The area is noted for its wild moorland landscapes , its long and varied coastline , its attractive villages , its many place-names derived from the Cornish language , and its very mild climate . Extensive stretches of Cornwall 's coastline , and Bodmin Moor , are protected as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty .   Cornwall is the homeland of the Cornish people and is recognised as one of the Celtic nations , retaining a distinct cultural identity that reflects its history . Some people question the present constitutional status of Cornwall , and a nationalist movement seeks greater autonomy within the United Kingdom in the form of a devolved legislative Cornish Assembly . On 24 April 2014 it was announced that Cornish people will be granted minority status under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities .   Toponymy   The name Cornwall derives from the combination of two separate terms from different languages . The Corn- part comes from the hypothesised original tribal name of the Celtic people who had lived here since the Iron Age , the Cornovii . The second element -wall derives from the Old English w ( e ) alh , meaning a `` foreigner '' or `` Welshman '' . The name first appears in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 891 as On Corn walum . In the Domesday Book it was referred to as Cornualia and in c. 1198 as Cornwal .   A latinisation of the name as Cornubia first appears in a mid-9th-century deed purporting to be a copy of one dating from c. 705 . Another variation , with Wales reinterpreted as Gallia , thus : Cornugallia , is first attested in 1086 . Finally , the Cornish language form of the name , Kernow , which first appears around 1400 , derives directly from the original Cornowii . which is postulated from a single mention in the Ravenna Cosmography of around 700 ( but based on earlier sources ) of Purocoronavis . This is considered to be a"], [126, "The 18th century lasted from January 1 , 1701 to December 31 , 1800 in the Gregorian calendar . During the 18th century , the Enlightenment culminated in the French and American revolutions . Philosophy and science increased in prominence . Philosophers dreamed of a brighter age . This dream turned into a reality with the French Revolution , although it was later compromised by the excesses of the Reign of Terror of Maximilien Robespierre . At first , the monarchies of Europe embraced Enlightenment ideals , but with the French Revolution they feared losing their power and formed broad coalitions for the counter-revolution . The Ottoman Empire underwent a protracted decline , as it failed to keep up with the technological advances in Europe . The Tulip period symbolized a period of peace and reorientation towards European society , after victory against a burgeoning Russian Empire in the Pruth River Campaign . Throughout the century various reforms were introduced with limited success .   The 18th century also marked the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as an independent state . The once-powerful and vast kingdom , which was able to conquer Moscow and defeat the great Ottoman armies , collapsed under numerous invasions . Its semi-democratic government system was not robust enough to rival the neighboring monarchies of the Kingdom of Prussia , the Russian Empire and the Archduchy of Austria which divided the Commonwealth territories among them , changing the landscape of Central European politics for the next hundred years .   European colonization of the Americas and other parts of the world intensified and the associated mass migrations of people grew in size as the Age of Sail continued . Great Britain became a major power worldwide with the defeat of France in North America in the 1760s and the conquest of large parts of India . However , Britain lost many of its North American colonies after the American Revolution , which resulted in the creation of the newly independent United States of America . The Industrial Revolution started in Britain in the 1770s with the production of the improved steam engine . Despite its modest beginnings in the 18th century , steam-powered machinery would radically change human society and the environment .   Western historians have occasionally defined the 18th century otherwise for the purposes of their work . For example , the `` short '' 18th century may be defined as 1715–1789 , denoting the period of time between the death of Louis XIV of France and the start of the French Revolution with an emphasis on directly interconnected events . To historians who expand the century to include larger historical movements , the `` long '' 18th century may run from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 or even later .

It is surrounded by six countries : Mali to the north ; Niger to the east ; Benin to the southeast ; Togo and Ghana to the south ; and Ivory Coast to the southwest . Its capital is Ouagadougou . In 2014 , its population was estimated at just over 17.3 million . Burkina Faso is a francophone country . It has a population of 18.7 million as of 2016 .   Formerly called the Republic of Upper Volta , the country was renamed `` Burkina Faso '' on 4 August 1984 by then-President Thomas Sankara . Residents of Burkina Faso are known as Burkinabé ( ) . French is an official language of government and business .   Before the conquest of what is now Burkina Faso by the French and other colonial powers during the late 19th century the country was ruled by various ethnic groups including the Mossi kingdoms . After gaining independence from France in 1960 , the country underwent many governmental changes . Blaise Compaoré was the most recent president and ruled the country from 1987 until he was ousted from power by the popular youth upheaval of 31 October 2014 . This resulted in a semi-presidential republic which lasted from October 2014 to September 2015 . On 17 September 2015 the provisional government was in turn toppled by an apparent military coup d'état carried out by the Regiment of Presidential Security . On 24 September 2015 , after pressure from the African Union , ECOWAS , and the armed forces , the military junta agreed to step down , and Michel Kafando was reinstated as Acting President .   History   Prehistory   The northwestern part of today 's Burkina Faso was populated by hunter-gatherers between 14,000 and 5000 BC . Their tools , including scrapers , chisels and arrowheads , were discovered in 1973 through archeological excavations . Agricultural settlements were established between 3600 and 2600 BC . The Bura culture was an Iron-Age civilization centered in the southwest portion of modern-day Niger and in the southeast part of contemporary Burkina Faso . Iron industry , in smelting and forging for tools and weapons , had developed in Sub-Saharan Africa by 1200 BC .   Early history   Historians debate the exact dates when Burkina Faso 's many ethnic groups arrived . The Proto-Mossi arrived in the far eastern part of what is today Burkina Faso sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries , the Samo arrived around the 15th century , the Dogon lived in Burkina Faso 's north and northwest regions until sometime in the 15th or 16th centuries , and many of the other ethnic groups that make up the country 's population arrived in the region during this time .   During the Middle Ages the Mossi established several separate kingdoms including those of Tenkodogo , Yatenga , Gourma , Zandoma , and Ouagadougou . Sometime between 1328 and 1338 Mossi warriors raided Timbuktu but the Mossi were defeated by Sonni Ali of Songhai at the Battle of Kobi in Mali in 1483 .   During the early 16th century the Songhai conducted many slave raids into what is today Burkina Faso . During the 18th century the Gwiriko Empire was established at Bobo Dioulasso and ethnic groups such as the Dyan , Lobi , and Birifor settled along the Black Volta .   From colony to independence ( 1890s–1958 )   Starting in the early 1890s a series of British , French and German military officers made attempts to claim parts of what is today Burkina Faso . At times these colonialists and their armies fought the local peoples ; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties . The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties amongst themselves . Through a complex series of events what is Burkina Faso eventually became a French protectorate in 1896 .   The eastern and western regions , where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler Samori Ture complicated the situation , came under French occupation in 1897 . By 1898 , the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso was nominally conquered ; however , French control of many parts remained uncertain .   The Franco-British Convention of 14 June 1898 created the country 's modern borders . In the French territory , a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years . In 1904 , the largely pacified territories of the Volta basin were integrated into the Upper Senegal and Niger colony of French"], [129, "Chesil Beach , sometimes called Chesil Bank , in Dorset , southern England is one of three major shingle structures in Britain . Its toponym is derived from the Old English ceosel or cisel , meaning `` gravel '' or `` shingle '' .   The beach is often identified as a tombolo , although research into the geomorphology of the area has revealed that it is in fact a barrier beach which has `` rolled '' landwards , joining the mainland with the Isle of Portland , giving the appearance of a tombolo . The shingle beach is 29 km long , 200 m wide and 15 m high . The beach and the Fleet are part of the Jurassic Coast , a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and the location for a 2007 novel , On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan .   At the eastern end of the beach at the village of Chiswell , against the cliffs of the Isle of Portland , the beach curves round sharply to form Chesil Cove . This part of the beach protects the low-lying village from flooding . The beach has been the scene of many shipwrecks , and as such was named by Thomas Hardy as `` Dead Man 's Bay '' . Westwards the shingle forms a straight line along the coast , enclosing the Fleet , a shallow tidal lagoon .   The beach provides shelter from the prevailing winds and waves for the town of Weymouth and the village of Chiswell on Portland .   Varying with the Bank 's unbroken increase in height , to , above mean high water , the size of the flint and chert shingle varies from pea-sized at the north-west end ( by West Bay ) to orange-sized at the south-east end ( by Portland ) . It is said that smugglers who landed on the beach in the middle of the night could judge `` exactly where they were '' by the size of the shingle .   There are three owners of the beach ; the Crown Estates own the beach from Portland to its boundary stone at Littlesea . The bed of the lagoon and Chesil Beach adjacent to the Fleet , as well as the majority of the land of Upper Fleet to West Bexington , is owned by the Ilchester Estates , who are based north of Dorchester , but also have a local office in Abbotsbury . Finally from West Bexington to West Bay it is owned by the National Trust . The whole of Chesil Beach south from the Portland Bound Stone is registered common land over which there is a right of public access on foot .   Origin   The origin of Chesil Beach has been argued over for some time . Originally it was believed that beach material was from the Budleigh Salterton pebble beds to the west and later from Portland to the south east . The differences between the pebbles on the beach and nearby sources is now put down to the Flandrian isostatic sea level rise , so the feature could also be considered a barrier beach or bar , that happens to connect the mainland to an island rather than a 'true ' tombolo . Normally , tombolos are created due to the effects of the island on waves ( through refraction ) and to sediment transport , which usually produces a beach perpendicular to the mainland rather than parallel to it .   Fossils occur all along the landward shore of the Fleet and along the landward side of Chesil Beach from Abbotsbury to West Bay . The main site is at Burton Bradstock .   History   There have been many shipwrecks on Chesil Beach , particularly during the age of sail . The beach was particularly dangerous within the English Channel , as it forms an extended lee shore during south-westerly gales . A ship coming up the Channel had to clear Portland Bill to be safe , but the wind and tide would be pushing it northwards into Lyme Bay . When sailing ships were common , a strong string of coastguards were based along the beach , with lookouts and cottages at Chiswell , Wyke Regis , Chickerell , Langton Herring , Abbotsbury , East Bexington , Burton Bradstock and West Bay . At present there are no manned stations along the beach , as coverage is provided when required from Portland Coastguard .   The local fishermen , particularly at Portland , developed a purpose-built vessel to withstand the sea actions of Chesil Beach . The boat , known as a Lerret , is a double-ended open fishing"], [130, "John Smith ( 13 September 1938 – 12 May 1994 ) was a Scottish Labour Party politician who served as Leader of the Labour Party from July 1992 until his death from a heart attack in May 1994 .   Smith first entered Parliament in 1970 and , after junior ministerial roles as Minister of State for Energy ( 1975–1976 ) and Minister of State for the Privy Council Office ( 1976–1977 ) , he entered the Cabinet at the end of James Callaghan 's tenure as Prime Minister , serving as Secretary of State for Trade and President of the Board of Trade ( 1978–1979 ) . During Labour 's time in Opposition to Margaret Thatcher 's Conservative government , he rose through the Shadow Cabinet , serving as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade ( 1979–1982 ) , Shadow Secretary of State for Energy ( 1982–1983 ) , Shadow Secretary of State for Employment ( 1983–1984 ) , Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry ( 1984–1987 ) and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer ( 1987–1992 ) .   After Labour leader Neil Kinnock resigned following the Party 's surprise loss in the 1992 general election to new Conservative leader John Major , Smith was elected his successor in July 1992 . He continued Kinnock 's moves to reform Labour , abolishing the trade union block vote at Labour party conferences and replacing it with `` one member , one vote '' at the 1993 party conference . However , his overall cautious approach to reform , which was dubbed `` one more heave '' , sought to avoid controversy and win the next election by capitalising on the unpopularity of the Conservative government . This frustrated many modernisers like Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and after Smith 's sudden death in May 1994 , he was succeeded as Leader by Blair , who undertook the subsequent re-branding of Labour as New Labour , winning the 1997 general election in a landslide .   Early life   The son of a headmaster , Smith was born in Dalmally , Argyll , and grew up in Ardrishaig . He attended Dunoon Grammar School , lodging in the town with a landlady and going home during the holidays , before enrolling at the University of Glasgow , where he studied History from 1956 to 1959 , and then Law , from 1959 to 1962 . He joined the Labour Party in 1956 .   He became involved in debating with the Glasgow University Dialectic Society and the Glasgow University Union . In 1962 , he won The Observer Mace debating competition , speaking with Gordon Hunter . In 1995 , after his death , the competition was renamed the John Smith Memorial Mace in his honour .   After graduating , Smith practised as a solicitor for a year . He was then elected to the Faculty of Advocates ( the Scottish equivalent of being called to the bar ) .   Member of Parliament   Smith first stood as a Labour parliamentary candidate at a by-election in 1961 in the East Fife constituency ; he contested that seat again in the 1964 general election . At the 1970 general election , he was elected as Member of Parliament ( MP ) for North Lanarkshire succeeding Margaret Herbison . Smith defied the Labour whips in 1971 , joining Labour MPs led by Roy Jenkins who voted in favour of entry to the European Economic Community . These included Roy Hattersley , Shirley Williams , Bill Rodgers and David Owen all of whom he was later to sit with in the Callaghan cabinet .   In government   In October 1974 , Harold Wilson offered Smith the post of Solicitor General for Scotland . Smith turned it down , not wishing his political career to become sidelined as a law officer . He was instead made an Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Energy . In December 1975 , he was made a Minister of State . When James Callaghan became Prime Minister , Smith became a Minister of State at the Privy Council Office , serving with Labour 's Deputy leader , Michael Foot , the Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons . In this position Smith piloted the highly controversial devolution proposals for Scotland and Wales through the House of Commons . Smith 's adroit handling of these proposals impressed Callaghan , and in November 1978 , when Edmund Dell retired , Callaghan appointed Smith Secretary of State for Trade . In this post , Smith was the youngest member of the cabinet , and served there until the 1979 general"], [131, "The Last Supper is the final meal that , in the Gospel accounts , Jesus shared with his Apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion . The Last Supper is commemorated by Christians especially on Maundy Thursday . The Last Supper provides the scriptural basis for the Eucharist , also known as `` Holy Communion '' or `` The Lord 's Supper '' .   The First Epistle to the Corinthians contains the earliest known mention of the Last Supper . The four canonical Gospels all state that the Last Supper took place towards the end of the week , after Jesus ' triumphal entry into Jerusalem and that Jesus and his Apostles shared a meal shortly before Jesus was crucified at the end of that week . During the meal Jesus predicts his betrayal by one of the Apostles present , and foretells that before the next morning , Peter will deny knowing him .   The three Synoptic Gospels and the First Epistle to the Corinthians include the account of the institution of the Eucharist in which Jesus takes bread , breaks it and gives it to the Apostles , saying : `` This is my body which is given for you '' . The Gospel of John does not include this episode , but tells of Jesus washing the feet of the Apostles , giving the new commandment `` to love one another as I have loved you '' , and has a detailed farewell discourse by Jesus , calling the Apostles who follow his teachings `` friends and not servants '' , as he prepares them for his departure .   Scholars have looked to the Last Supper as the source of early Christian Eucharist traditions . Others see the account of the Last Supper as derived from 1st-century eucharistic practiceFunk , Robert W. and the Jesus Seminar . The acts of Jesus : the search for the authentic deeds of Jesus . HarperSanFrancisco . 1998 . Introduction , p. 1-40 as described by Paul in the mid-50s .   The Last Supper served the dual purpose of venerating Passover , the escape of the Jews from slavery in Egypt , and the establishment of a new tradition , Christianity .   Terminology   The term `` Last Supper '' does not appear in the New Testament , The Gospel according to Luke : introduction , translation , and notes , Volume 28 , Part 1 by Joseph A. Fitzmyer 1995 ISBN 0-385-00515-6 page 1378 but traditionally many Christians refer to the New Testament accounts of the last meal Jesus shared with his Apostles as the `` Last Supper '' .   Most Protestants use the term `` Lord 's Supper '' , stating that the term `` last '' suggests this was one of several meals and not the meal . The term `` Lord 's Supper '' refers both to the biblical event and the act of `` Holy Communion '' and Eucharistic ( `` thanksgiving '' ) celebration within their liturgy . Evangelical Protestants also use the term `` Lord 's Supper '' , but most do not use the terms `` Eucharist '' or the word `` Holy '' with the name `` Communion '' .Humanists and Reformers : A History of the Renaissance and Reformation by Bard Thompson 1996 ISBN 978-0-8028-6348-5 pages 493-494   The Eastern Orthodox use the term `` Mystical Supper '' which refers both to the biblical event and the act of Eucharistic celebration within liturgy .   Scriptural basis   The last meal that Jesus shared with his disciples is described in all four canonical Gospels ( , , and ) . This meal later became known as the Last Supper.The Encyclopedia of Christianity , Volume 4 by Erwin Fahlbusch , 2005 ISBN 978-0-8028-2416-5 pages 52-56 The Last Supper was likely a retelling of the events of the last meal of Jesus among the early Christian community , and became a ritual which recounted that meal .   Paul 's First Epistle to the Corinthians , which was likely written before the Gospels , includes a reference to the Last Supper but emphasizes the theological basis rather than giving a detailed description of the event or its background.The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary by Craig A. Evans 2003 ISBN 0-7814-3868-3 pages 465-477   Background and setting   The overall narrative that is shared in all Gospel accounts that leads to the Last Supper is that after the Triumphal entry into Jerusalem early in the week , and encounters with various people and the Jewish elders , Jesus and his disciples share a meal towards the end of the week . After the meal , Jesus is"], [132, "The Queen Is Dead is the third studio album by the English rock band the Smiths . It was released on 16 June 1986 in the United Kingdom by Rough Trade Records and released in the United States on 23 June 1986 through Sire Records .   The album spent twenty two weeks on the UK Albums Chart , peaking at number two . Across the Atlantic , it reached number 28 in Canada on the RPM 100 album chart and number 70 on the Billboard 200 chart , and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1990 . It has sold consistently well ever since and has received unanimous critical acclaim , with NME listing it as the greatest album of all time in 2013 .   Songwriting   Guitarist Johnny Marr wrote several songs that would later appear on The Queen Is Dead while the Smiths toured Britain in early 1985 , working out song arrangements with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce during soundchecks . The title of the album is from the novel , `` Last Exit to Brooklyn '' by author Hubert Selby , Jr .. The title of the album could be a reference to the scene in Macbeth where Seyton informs the title character of his wife 's murder ( `` The queen , my Lord , is dead '' ) . The title could also refer to a scene in Cymbeline where Cornelius , the doctor , informs Cymbeline , the king , `` The queen is dead . ''   `` The Boy with the Thorn in His Side '' was , according to Marr , `` an effortless piece of music '' , and was written on tour in the spring of 1985 . The song 's lyrics refer allegorically to the band 's experience of the music industry that failed to appreciate it . In 2003 , Morrissey named this as his favourite Smiths song .   A demo of the music for `` Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others '' was posted by Marr through Morrissey 's letterbox in the summer of 1985 . Morrissey then completed the song by adding lyrics . Marr has stated that he `` preferred the music to the lyrics '' .   `` Frankly , Mr. Shankly '' , `` I Know It 's Over '' and `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out '' were written by Morrissey and Marr in a `` marathon '' writing session in the late summer of 1985 at Marr 's home in Bowdon , Greater Manchester . The first of these is reputed to have been addressed to Geoff Travis , head of the Smiths ' record label Rough Trade . Travis has since described it as `` a funny lyric '' about `` Morrissey 's desire to be somewhere else '' , acknowledging that a line in the song about `` bloody awful poetry '' was a reference to a poem he had written for Morrissey .   `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out '' features lyrics drawn from `` Lonely Planet Boy '' by the New York Dolls . According to Marr : `` When we first played it , I thought it was the best song I 'd ever heard '' . The guitar part of `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out ' draws on the Rolling Stones cover of Marvin Gaye 's `` Hitch Hike '' , a song that , itself , was an inspiration for the Velvet Underground 's `` There She Goes Again '' .   The music for `` Never Had No One Ever '' , completed in August 1985 , was based on a demo which Marr had recorded in December 1984 , itself based on `` I Need Somebody '' by the Stooges . According to Marr : `` The atmosphere of that track pretty much sums up the whole album and what it was like recording it . '' The lyric to the song reflects Morrissey 's feeling unsafe and , being from an immigrant family , not at home on the streets of Manchester .   `` The Boy with the Thorn in His Side '' , `` Bigmouth Strikes Again '' and `` Frankly , Mr. Shankly '' were debuted live during a tour of Scotland in September and October , during which `` The Queen Is Dead '' and `` There Is a Light That Never Goes Out '' were soundchecked . `` The Queen is Dead '' was based on a song Marr began writing as a teenager . `` Cemetry Gates '' ( sic ) was a late addition to"], [133, "Quantrill 's Raiders were the best-known of the pro-Confederate partisan rangers ( `` bushwhackers '' ) , who fought in the American Civil War . Their leader was William Quantrill and they included Jesse James and his brother Frank .   Early in the war , Missouri and Kansas , nominally under Union government , had become bandit country , with groups of Confederate bushwhackers and anti-slavery Jayhawkers competing for control . The town of Lawrence , Kansas , a centre of anti-slavery sentiment , had outlawed Quantrill ’ s men and jailed some of their young womenfolk . In August 1863 , Quantrill led a furious attack on the town , killing over 180 civilians , supposedly in retaliation for the casualties caused when the women ’ s jail had collapsed , possibly by design .   The Confederate government , which had granted Quantrill a field commission under the Partisan Ranger Act , was outraged and withdrew support for such irregular forces . By 1864 , Quantrill had lost control of the group , which split-up into small bands . Some , including Quantrill , were killed in various engagements . Others lived on , to hold reunions many years later , when the name Quantrill 's Raiders began to be used .   Origins   The Missouri-Kansas border area was fertile ground for the outbreak of guerrilla warfare when the Civil War erupted in 1861 . Historian Albert Castel wrote :   In February 1861 Missouri voters elected delegates to a statewide convention , which rejected secession by a vote of 89-1 . Unionists , led by regular U.S. Army commander Nathaniel Lyon and Frank Blair of the politically powerful Blair family , and increasingly pro-secessionist forces , led by governor Claiborne Jackson and future Confederate general Sterling Price , contested for the political and military control of the state . By June , there was open warfare between Union forces and troops supporting the Confederacy . Guerrilla warfare immediately erupted throughout the state and intensified in August after the Union defeat at the Battle of Wilson 's Creek .   By August 1862 , with the Union victory at the Battle of Pea Ridge , the state was free of significant regular Confederate troops but the violence in Missouri continued . One historical work describes the situation in the state after Wilson 's Creek :   The most notorious of these guerrilla forces was led by William Clarke Quantrill .   Methods and legal status   Quantrill was not the only Confederate guerrilla operating in Missouri , but he rapidly gained the greatest notoriety . He and his men ambushed Union patrols and supply convoys , seized the mail , and occasionally struck towns on either side of the Kansas-Missouri border . Reflecting the internecine nature of the guerrilla conflict in Missouri , Quantrill directed much of his effort against pro-Union civilians , attempting to drive them from the territory where he operated . Quantrill 's guerrillas attacked Jayhawkers , Union militia , and U.S. forces relying primarily on ambush and raids .   Under his direction , Confederate guerrillas perfected military tactics such as disguises , coordinated and synchronized attacks , planned dispersal after an attack using pre-planned routes and relays of horses , and technical methods , including the use of multiple .36 caliber Colt revolvers , for increased firepower and their improved accuracy over the .44 caliber .   Confederate induction   On 15 August 1862 , Quantrill was granted a field commission as a captain in the Confederate army under the Confederate Partisan Ranger Act . Other officers were elected by the men . Quantrill often referred to himself as a colonel . Despite the legal responsibility assumed by the Confederate government , Quantrill often acted on his own with little concern for his government 's policy or orders . His most notable operation was the Lawrence Massacre , a revenge raid on Lawrence , Kansas in August 1863 .   Lawrence Massacre   Lawrence had historically been the base of operations for abolitionist and jayhawker organizations . During the period of border warfare ( 1855-1861 ) , known as `` Bleeding Kansas '' in the press , and during the Civil War , irregular raids into Missouri by abolitionists , redlegs , and jayhawkers and Union soldiers , resulted in robberies , theft , arson , and the murder of citizens .   In August 1863 , Union authorities assigned to the border were frustrated by the hit-and-run tactics of Quantrill 's guerrillas and particularly the aid provided by Confederate sympathizers in Western Missouri . Authorities began imprisoning the female family members of the known guerrillas"], [134, "A nation state is a type of state that conjoins the political entity of a state to the cultural entity of a nation , from which it aims to derive its political legitimacy to rule and potentially its status as a sovereign state if one accepts the declarative theory of statehood as opposed to the constitutive theory.Such a definition is a working one : `` All attempts to develop terminological consensus around `` nation '' resulted in failure '' , concludes . Walker Connor , in [ ] discusses the impressions surrounding the characters of `` nation '' , `` ( sovereign ) state '' , `` nation state '' , and `` nationalism '' . Connor , who gave the term `` ethnonationalism '' wide currency , also discusses the tendency to confuse nation and state and the treatment of all states as if nation states . In Globalization and Belonging , Sheila L. Crouche discusses `` The Definitional Dilemma '' ( pp . 85ff ) .  A state is specifically a political and geopolitical entity , whilst a nation is a cultural and ethnic one . The term `` nation state '' implies that the two coincide , in that a state has chosen to adopt and endorse a specific cultural group as associated with it . `` Nation state '' formation can take place at different times in different parts of the world .   The concept of a nation state can be compared and contrasted with that of the multinational state , city state , empire , confederation , and other state formations with which it may overlap . The key distinction is the identification of a people with a polity in the `` nation state . ''   History and origins   The origins and early history of nation states are disputed . A major theoretical question is : `` Which came first , the nation or the nation state ? '' Scholars such as Steven Weber , David Woodward , and Jeremy Black have advanced the hypothesis that the nation state did n't arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source , nor was it an accident of history or political invention ; but is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in political economy , capitalism , mercantilism , political geography , and geography combined together with cartography and advances in map-making technologies . It was with these intellectual discoveries and technological advances that the nation state arose . For others , the nation existed first , then nationalist movements arose for sovereignty , and the nation state was created to meet that demand . Some `` modernization theories '' of nationalism see it as a product of government policies to unify and modernize an already existing state . Most theories see the nation state as a 19th-century European phenomenon , facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education , mass literacy and mass media . However , historians also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in Portugal and the Dutch Republic .   In France , Eric Hobsbawm argues , the French state preceded the formation of the French people . Hobsbawm considers that the state made the French nation , not French nationalism , which emerged at the end of the 19th century , the time of the Dreyfus Affair . At the time of the 1789 French Revolution , only half of the French people spoke some French , and 12-13 % spoke it `` fairly '' , according to Hobsbawm .   During the Italian unification , the number of people speaking the Italian language was even lower . The French state promoted the unification of various dialects and languages into the French language . The introduction of conscription and the Third Republic 's 1880s laws on public instruction , facilitated the creation of a national identity , under this theory .   Some nation states , such as Germany or Italy , came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by nationalists , during the 19th century . In both cases , the territory was previously divided among other states , some of them very small . The sense of common identity was at first a cultural movement , such as in the Völkisch movement in German-speaking states , which rapidly acquired a political significance . In these cases , the nationalist sentiment and the nationalist movement clearly precede the unification of the German and Italian nation states .   Historians Hans Kohn , Liah Greenfeld , Philip White and others have classified nations such as Germany or Italy , where cultural unification preceded state unification , as ethnic nations"], [135, "James David Rodríguez Rubio ( born 12 July 1991 ) , known as James Rodríguez , is a Colombian professional footballer who plays for Spanish club Real Madrid and captains the Colombia national team as an attacking midfielder or winger . James is commonly ranked as one of the best young players in the world .  He is praised for his technique , vision and playmaking skills , and often referred as the successor to his compatriot Carlos Valderrama .   James became well known in Europe during his time at Porto , winning several trophies and individual awards during his three years at the club . In 2014 , James moved from AS Monaco to Real Madrid for a transfer fee of €80 million , which beats the one set by Radamel Falcao and makes him the most expensive Colombian football player and one of the most expensive players in football . He started his international career with the Colombian under-20 team , with which he won the 2011 Toulon Tournament . He then captained the U-20 team during the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup . Due to his performance in the tournament , he was regularly called into the senior squad by the age of 20 . He played in the 2014 FIFA World Cup where he won the Golden Boot as the top goalscorer and was part of the Cup 's All Star Team .   Club career   Envigado   Born in Cúcuta , James spent his childhood in the city of Ibagué . He was born to Wilson James Rodríguez Bedoya and Maria Del Pilar Rubio . James started his professional football career in 2006 with the Colombian second division club Envigado , with which he reached the Colombian first division through the 2007 promotion .   Banfield   2008   In 2008 , he was signed by Argentine team Banfield . He made his first team debut on 7 February 2009 and scored his first goal for the club on 27 February with a long range strike in a 3–1 victory over Rosario Central .   2009   In 2009 , he became a regular first team player featuring in every game of the Apertura 2009 . At only 17 , he became the youngest foreigner to score a goal in Argentina . His second goal for Banfield came on 26 September when he scored with a strike into the top corner from outside of the area in an important 2–1 win against Newell 's Old Boys , a victory that helped Banfield win the Argentine championship for the first time in the club history .   In December 2009 , Italian club Udinese planned to make a bid for James for a reported €5 million after the 2010 Copa Libertadores . However , Banfield rejected the bid , labelling it as `` insufficient . ''   For the Clausura 2010 , on 13 February 2010 , James scored a golazo in the match against arch rivals Lanús with a left-footed lob to make the game 2–0 in the final minutes . After the game , daily sports website Diario Olé likened his playing and personal style to Cristiano Ronaldo and nicknamed him the `` James Bond of Banfield '' .   2010   On 10 February 2010 , James scored his first Copa Libertadores goal in a 2–1 home victory over Mexican club Monarcas Morelia . James added to his glowing reputation a week later with a goal in a daunting victory over Copa Libertadores group rivals Deportivo Cuenca away from home , scoring the fourth goal of the game with a nice finish in the area on his left foot . Banfield thrashed the home team 4–1 . His wonderful scoring season continued with a brace in the Copa Libertadores group game on 10 March 2010 . In an away match against Uruguayan club Nacional , James scored first with a diving header and then from the penalty spot on his right foot . The game ended 2–2 .  The 18-year-old netted another goal against Brazilian club Internacional on 29 April 2010 in the first leg match of Copa Libertadores 2010 Round 16 which Banfield won 3–1 . This goal brought his tally to five goals in seven games .

It ended several months later in March 1839 with a British-brokered peace . The intervention followed many claims by French nationals of losses due to unrest in Mexico City , as well as the failure of Mexico to pay a large debt to France .   This incident was the first and lesser of Mexico 's two 19th-century wars with France , being followed by the French invasion of 1861–67 , resulting in the installation of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico .   Background   During the early years of the new Mexican republic , there was widespread civil disorder as factions competed for control . In 1828 , President Guadalupe Victoria ejected Lorenzo de Zavala from the office of governor of the State of Mexico . Zavala , supported by Antonio López de Santa Anna , rallied most of the garrison in Mexico City ( then a part of Mexico State ) to his aid . Four days of fighting in Mexico City resulted in Zavala 's winning and installing a new president , Vicente Guerrero .   The fighting in the streets destroyed a great deal of personal property of residents . Average citizens had little recourse for damages suffered . They had no consuls , or representatives to speak on their behalf . Foreigners whose property was damaged or destroyed by rioters or bandits were usually unable to obtain compensation from the government . They began to appeal to their own governments for help and compensation , as they were often international traders . Despite repeated claims from French nationals in the city , the French government let the matter subside .   Course of war   In 1838 a French pastry cook , Remontel , claimed that his shop in the Tacubaya district of Mexico City had been ruined by looting Mexican officers in 1828 . He appealed to France 's King Louis-Philippe . Coming to a national 's aid , France demanded 600,000 pesos in damages , an enormous sum for the time , when the typical daily wage in Mexico City was about one peso ( 8 Mexican reals ) . More importantly , the government of Mexico had defaulted on millions of dollars ' worth of loans from France . Diplomat Baron Antoine Louis Deffaudis gave Mexico an ultimatum to pay , or the French would demand satisfaction .   When president Anastasio Bustamante made no payment , the king of France ordered a fleet under Rear Admiral Charles Baudin to declare and carry out a blockade of all Mexican ports from Yucatán to the Rio Grande , to bombard the Mexican fortress of San Juan de Ulúa , and to seize the city of Veracruz , which was the most important port on the Gulf coast . French forces captured virtually the entire Mexican Navy at Veracruz by December 1838 . Mexico declared war on France .   With trade cut off , the Mexicans began smuggling imports via Corpus Christi , Republic of Texas , and into Mexico . Fearing that France would blockade the Republic 's ports as well , a battalion of Texan forces began patrolling Corpus Christi Bay to stop Mexican smugglers . One smuggling party abandoned their cargo of about a hundred barrels of flour on the beach at the mouth of the bay , thus giving Flour Bluff its name . The United States , ever watchful of its relations with Mexico , sent the schooner Woodbury to help the French in their blockade .   Meanwhile , acting without explicit government authority , Antonio López de Santa Anna , known for his military leadership , came out of retirement from his hacienda near Xalapa and surveyed the defenses of Veracruz . He offered his services to the government , which ordered him to fight the French by any means necessary . He led Mexican forces against the French . In a skirmish with the rear guard of the French , Santa Anna was wounded in the leg by French grapeshot . His leg was amputated , and buried with full military honors . Exploiting his wounds with eloquent propaganda , Santa Anna catapulted back to power .   Peace restored   With the diplomatic intervention of the United Kingdom , eventually President Bustamante agreed to pay the 600,000 pesos for the baker 's damages , and"], [137, "Boxing is a martial art and combat sport in which two people wearing protective gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring .   Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth sport and is a common fixture in most international games—it also has its own World Championships . Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds . The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee , is disqualified for breaking a rule , resigns by throwing in a towel , or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges ' scorecards at the end of the contest . In the event that both fighters gain equal scores from the judges , the fight is considered a draw ( professional boxing ) . In Olympic boxing , due to the fact that a winner must be declared , in the case of a draw - the judges use technical criteria to choose the most deserving winner of the bout .   While people have fought in hand-to-hand combat since before the dawn of history , the origin of boxing as an organized sport may be its acceptance by the ancient Greeks as an Olympic game in BC 688 . Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights , largely in Great Britain , to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century , again initially in Great Britain and later in the United States .   History   Ancient history   See also Ancient Greek boxing   The earliest known depiction of boxing comes from a Sumerian relief in Iraq from the 3rd millennium BCE Later depictions from the 2nd millennium BC are found in reliefs from the Mesopotamian nations of Assyria and Babylonia , and in Hittite art from Asia Minor . The earliest evidence for fist fighting with any kind of gloves can be found on Minoan Crete ( c.1650–1400 BCE ) , and on Sardinia , if we consider the boxing statues of Prama mountains ( c. 2000–1000 BC ) .   Boxing was a popular spectator sport in Ancient Rome . In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped leather thongs around their fists . Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a weapon . The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the cestus which then led to a more sinister weapon called the myrmex ( 'limb piercer ' ) . Fighting events were held at Roman Amphitheatres . The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events . However , especially in later times , purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities , and their lives were not given up without due consideration . Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor . This is where the term ring came from . In AD 393 , during the Roman gladiator period , boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality . It was not until the late 17th century that boxing re-surfaced in London .   Early London prize ring rules   Records of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western Roman Empire when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned . However , there are detailed records of various fist-fighting sports that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries . There was also a sport in ancient Rus called Kulachniy Boy or `` Fist Fighting '' .   As the wearing of swords became less common , there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists . The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of bare-knuckle boxing sometimes referred to as prizefighting . The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the London Protestant Mercury , and the first English bare-knuckle champion was James Figg in 1719 . This is also the time when the word `` boxing '' first came to be used . It should be noted , that this earliest form of modern boxing was very different . Contests in Mr. Figg 's time , in addition to fist fighting , also contained fencing and cudgeling . On 6 January 1681 , the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when Christopher Monck , 2nd Duke of Albemarle ( and later Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica ) engineered a bout between his"], [138, "The Path is the tenth studio album by English acoustic roots duo Show of Hands , released in April 2003 . The album was conceived as an `` instrumental journey '' around the South West Coast Path , a 630-mile coastline path opened in 1978 in the duo 's native West Country , and a celebration of the coastline 's `` sights and sounds '' . It is the band 's only completely instrumental album , with each of its songs named after and inspired by different locations on the path . It was a project between Show Of Hands and The South West Coast Path Team , as part of the latter 's celebrations for the silver jubilee ( 25th anniversary ) of the path . As such the album is endorsed by various organisations who own different parts of the path , namely The Countryside Agency , The National Trust and English Heritage Commission , .and the music is ambient instrumentals inspired by different locations around the coastline .   The duo hoped that , with the album , listeners would be inspired to discover or rediscover the `` endless fascination '' of the coast path . The album was released on 14 April 2003 by the duo 's own label Hands on Music , a month before they released their following album Country Life . In July 2012 , music from The Path featured in several themed videos on a new interactive official website for the South West Coast Path , which attracts some 400,000 hits a year . One track from the album , `` Port Isaac '' , featured on their compilation album Roots : The Best of Show of Hands ( 2007 ) .   Background   Show of Hands entered the 2000s by recording an album of cover versions , Covers ( 2000 ) , which presented a stripped down sound with no overdubs or multitracking . They followed this their second concert at the Royal Albert Hall which was filmed for their VHS concert film The Big Gig ( 2001 ) , which itself was followed by their ninth studio album , Cold Frontier ( 2001 ) , which was co-produced between the duo and Mick Dolan , engineer for Steve Winwood . Critical praise greeted both releases , and the duo embarked on The Cold Frontier Tour in November 2001 , where they played a great deal of unreleased or `` rare '' material . The band 's live album Cold Cuts ( 2002 ) , which was drawn from material from the tour , was released to positive reviews . The duo began writing for what they planned to be their next album .   Meanwhile , The Countryside Agency were looking to celebrate the silver jubilee ( 25th anniversary ) of the South West Coast Path , a National Trail that remains the longest waymarked long-distance footpath ( and one of the longest in the UK ) . It stretches for 630 mi , running from Minehead in Somerset , along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall , to Poole Harbour in Dorset . It is also one of the more challenging trails as it rises and falls with every river mouth , and its total height climbed has been calculated to be 114,931 ft ( 35,031 m ) , almost four times the height of Mount Everest . It has been voted `` Britain 's Best Walking Route '' twice in a row by readers of the Ramblers Walk magazine , and regularly features in lists of the world 's best walks .   The South West Coast Path Association formed in 1973 , and after being constructed over five years , the path was opened in 1978 . To celebrate the silver jubilee of the association in 1998 , they set up a fund to raise money for markers at Minehead and South Haven Point , and erected `` Path Markers '' on the path at Minehead in 2001 and South Haven Point in 2002 . To celebrate the silver jubilee of the path 's opening , Show of Hands , who had began work on their tenth album Country Life , were asked by The South West Coast Path Association to create an album of music celebrating the path and the sites that it visits . Show of Hands are from Devon , the only English country to have two coastlines , and the South West Coast Path crosses both of them . As such , it became a local project for the duo . The duo changed their focus from Country Life to the album concerning the coast path 's silver jubilee . As different parts of the path are"], [139, "The Stockton and Darlington Railway ( S & DR ) was a railway company that operated in north-east England from 1825 to 1863 . The world 's first public railway to use steam locomotives , its first line connected collieries near Shildon with Stockton-on-Tees and Darlington , and was officially opened on 27 September 1825 . The movement of coal to ships rapidly became a lucrative business , and the line was soon extended to a new port and town at Middlesbrough . While coal waggons were hauled by steam locomotives from the start , passengers were carried in coaches drawn by horses until carriages hauled by steam locomotives were introduced in 1833 .   The S & DR was involved in the building of the East Coast Main Line between York and Darlington , but its main expansion was at Middlesbrough Docks and west into Weardale and east to Redcar . It suffered severe financial difficulties at the end of the 1840s and was nearly taken over by the York , Newcastle and Berwick Railway , before the discovery of iron ore in Cleveland and the subsequent increase in revenue meant it could pay its debts . At the beginning of the 1860 it took over railways that had crossed the Pennines to join the West Coast Main Line at and Clifton , near .   The company was taken over by the North Eastern Railway in 1863 , transferring 200 rtmi of line and about 160 locomotives , but continued to operate independently as the Darlington Section until 1876 . The opening of the S & DR was seen as proof of the effectiveness of steam railways and its anniversary was celebrated in 1875 , 1925 and 1975 . Much of the original route is now served by the Tees Valley Line , operated by Northern .   Genesis   Origins   Coal from the inland mines in County Durham was taken away on packhorses , and then horse and carts as the roads were improved . A canal was proposed by George Dixon in 1767 and again by John Rennie in 1815 , but both schemes failed . A few years later a canal was proposed on a route that bypassed Darlington and Yarm , and a meeting was held in Yarm to oppose the route . The Welsh engineer George Overton was consulted , and he advised building a tramroad . Overton carried out a survey and planned a route from the Etherley and Witton Collieries to Shildon , and then passing to the north of Darlington to reach Stockton . The Scottish engineer Robert Stevenson was said to favour the railway , and the Quaker Edward Pease supported it at a public meeting in Darlington on 13 November 1818 , promising a five per cent return on investment . Approximately two-thirds of the shares were sold locally , and the rest were bought by Quakers nationally . A private bill was presented to Parliament in March 1819 , but as the route passed through Earl of Eldon 's estate and one of the Earl of Darlington 's fox coverts , it was opposed and defeated by 13 votes .   Overton surveyed a new line that avoided Darlington 's estate and agreement was reached with Eldon , but another application was deferred early in 1820 , as the death of King George III had made it unlikely a bill would pass that parliamentary year . The promoters lodged a bill on 30 September 1820 , the route having changed again as agreement had not been reached with Viscount Barrington about the line passing over his land . The railway was unopposed this time , but the bill nearly failed to enter the committee stage as the required four-fifths of shares had not been sold . Pease subscribed £7,000 ; from that time he had considerable influence over the railway and it became known as `` the Quaker line '' . The Act that received royal assent on 19 April 1821 allowed for a railway that could be used by anyone with suitably built vehicles on payment of a toll , that was closed at night , and with which land owners within 5 mi could build branches and make junctions ; no mention was made of steam locomotives . This new railway initiated the construction of more railway lines , causing significant developments in railway mapping and cartography , iron and steel manufacturing , as well as in any industries requiring more efficient transportation .   George Stephenson   Concerned about Overton 's competence , Pease asked George Stephenson , an experienced enginewright of the collieries of Killingworth , to meet him in Darlington . On 12"], [140, "Croquet is a sport that involves hitting plastic or wooden balls with a mallet through hoops ( often called `` wickets '' in the United States ) embedded in a grass playing court .   History   The oldest document to bear the word croquet with a description of the modern game is the set of rules registered by Isaac Spratt in November 1856 with the Stationers ' Company in London . This record is now in the Public Record Office . In 1868 , the first croquet all-comers ' meet was held at Moreton-in-Marsh , Gloucestershire and in the same year the All England Croquet Club was formed at Wimbledon , London .   Regardless when and by what route it reached England and the British colonies in its recognizable form , croquet is , like golf , pall-mall , trucco , and kolven , among the later forms of ground billiards , which as a class have been popular in Western Europe back to at least the Late Middle Ages , with roots in classical antiquity , including sometimes the use of arches and pegs along with and balls and mallets or other striking sticks ( some more akin to modern field hockey sticks ) . By the 12th century , a team ball game called ' or ' , akin to a chaotic version of hockey or football ( depending on whether sticks were used ) , was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes ; it was attested in Cornwall as early as 1283 .   In the book Queen of Games : The History of Croquet , Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet , which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas .   The first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to Britain from France during the 1630–1685 reign of Charles II of England , and was played under the name of ' ( among other spellings , today usually pall-mall ) , derived ultimately from Latin words for ' '' ball and mallet ' ( the latter also found in the name of the earlier French game , ' ) . This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica , dated 1877 . In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England , Joseph Strutt , in 1611 , described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time : `` Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box [ wood ] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron , which he that can do at the fewest blows , or at the number agreed upon , wins . It is to be observed , that there are two of these arches , that is one at either end of the alley . The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second , and the walk in Saint James 's Park , now called the Mall , received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall , where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime . ''   While the name pall-mall and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere ( France and Italy ) , the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century . Some other early modern sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance ( as in golf ) , however an image in Strutt 's 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game ( balls on ground , hoop , bats and peg ) being played over a , garden-sized distance . The image 's caption describes the game as `` a curious ancient pastime '' , confirming that croquet games were not new in early nineteenth century England .   In Samuel Johnson 's 1755 dictionary , his definition of `` pall-mall '' clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet : `` A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring '' . However , there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game .   The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from Ireland during the 1850s , perhaps after being brought there from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches . Regular contact between Ireland and France had continued since the Norman invasion of Ireland in"], [141, "Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication , particularly the human ability to do so , and a language is any specific example of such a system . The scientific study of language is called linguistics .   Questions concerning the philosophy of language , such as whether words can represent experience , have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece . Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought . 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language . Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky .   Estimates of the number of languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000 . However , any precise estimate depends on a partly arbitrary distinction between languages and dialects . Natural languages are spoken or signed , but any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory , visual , or tactile stimuli – for example , in whistling , signed , or braille . This is because human language is modality-independent . Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning , when used as a general concept , `` language '' may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication , or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems , or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules . All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings . Oral and sign languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes , and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances .   Human language has the properties of productivity , recursivity , and displacement , and relies entirely on social convention and learning . Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication . Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems , acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality . This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume , and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions . Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain , but especially in Broca 's and Wernicke 's areas . Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood , and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old . The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture . Therefore , in addition to its strictly communicative uses , language also has many social and cultural uses , such as signifying group identity , social stratification , as well as social grooming and entertainment .   Languages evolve and diversify over time , and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur . A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family . The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes languages such as English , Russian , and Hindi ; the Sino-Tibetan family , which includes Mandarin and the other Chinese languages , and Tibetan ; the Afro-Asiatic family , which includes Arabic , Somali , and Hebrew ; the Bantu languages , which include Swahili , and Zulu , and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa ; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages , which include Indonesian , Malay , Tagalog , and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific .

The picture was directed by John Guillermin .   A co-production between 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. ( this was the first film to be a joint venture by two major Hollywood studios ) , it was adapted by Stirling Silliphant from a pair of novels , The Tower by Richard Martin Stern and The Glass Inferno by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson .   The film was a critical success , earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture , and was the highest-grossing film released in 1974 . The film was nominated for eight Oscars in all , winning three .   In addition to McQueen and Newman , the cast includes William Holden , Faye Dunaway , Fred Astaire , Susan Blakely , Richard Chamberlain , O. J. Simpson , Robert Vaughn , Robert Wagner , Susan Flannery , Gregory Sierra , Dabney Coleman and , in her final film , Jennifer Jones .   Plot   Architect Doug Roberts returns to San Francisco for the dedication of the Glass Tower , which he designed for owner James Duncan . At 138 stories ( 1,800 ft/550 m ) , it is the world 's tallest building . Shortly after his arrival , an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor . While Roberts accuses the building 's electrical engineer , Roger Simmons of cutting corners , Simmons insists the building is up to standards .   During the dedication ceremony , public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower 's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries . The lighting overloads the electrical system and Roberts orders it shut off . Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned . Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor but fail to prevent a security guard opening a door , leading to a fire flash which burns Giddings ( and who is later disclosed to have died ) .   Roberts reports the fire to a dismissive Duncan , who refuses to order an evacuation . Ill-equipped firefighters arrive to tackle the blaze , which soon spreads out of control . SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran forces Duncan to evacuate the guests in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor , directing them to express elevators . A guest , Lisolette Mueller , who is being wooed by con man Harlee Claiborne , rushes to the 87th floor to check on a young family . Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners to stay under budget .   Duncan , aided by Senator Parker and Mayor Ramsey , directs the elevator evacuation from the Promenade Room until the fire renders the express elevators unsafe . Not heeding Duncan 's directions , one last group takes an elevator to the ground , but are killed when it stops on the fire 's floor . The fire also traps Bigelow and his secretary/mistress Lorrie in his 65th floor office , killing them .   Security Chief Harry Jernigan and Roberts rescue Mueller and the family from 87 . Jernigan gets the mother out safely but Roberts , Mueller and the two children are halted by a collapsed stairwell . They make a perilous climb down the stairs but fire forces them up to the Promenade Room . With fire suppression efforts becoming ineffective , the building loses electrical power and O'Halloran 's men are forced to rappel down an elevator shaft .   A rooftop rescue results in disaster as guests rush the helicopter , causing it to crash , setting the roof ablaze and rendering further rooftop rescues impossible . Naval rescue teams attach a breeches buoy to the adjacent Peerless Building and rescue a number of guests , including Duncan 's daughter , Simmons ' wife Patty . Roberts rigs a gravity brake on the external scenic elevator allowing twelve people , including Roberts ' girlfriend Susan , Mueller , and the children , one trip down . An explosion leaves the descending elevator hanging by a single cable at the 110th floor , where Mueller falls to her death . O'Halloran and others save the rest .   Simmons tells Duncan that he and others will use the breeches buoy next , but Duncan punches him , saying the rest will draw numbers but he and his son-in-law will be the last to leave .

They comprise the majority population of Uzbekistan but are also found as a minority group in Afghanistan , Tajikistan , Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Turkmenistan , Russia and China . Uzbek diaspora communities also exist in Turkey , Saudi Arabia , and Pakistan .   Etymology   The origin of the word Uzbek remains disputed . One view holds that it is eponymously named after Oghuz Khagan , also known as Oghuz Beg , became the word Uzbek .  Another states that the name means independent or the lord itself , from Oʻz ( self ) and the Turkic title Bek/Bey/Beg . There is another theory which holds that the pronunciation of Uz comes from one of the Oghuz Turks variously known as Uz or Uguz united with the word Bey or Bek to form uguz-bey , meaning `` leader of an oguz '' .   Origins   Before , 5th century , what is today 's Uzbekistan was part of Sogdia , mainly inhabited by Sogdians , an Indo-Iranian people . It was part of the Achaemenid Empire and later part of Sasanian Empire . From 5th to 6th century , what is today 's Uzbekistan was part of the Hephthalite Empire . From 6th to 8th century , what is today 's Uzbekistan was under the rule of Göktürk Khanate . Turkic and Chinese migration into central Asia occurred during the Chinese Tang Dynasty , and Chinese armies commanded by Turkic generals stationed in large parts of central Asia . But Chinese influence ended with the An Lushan rebellion . From the 9th century on , Transoxania was under the rule of Turkic Kara-Khanid Khanate , their arrival in Transoxania signalled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia . Kara-Khanid ruler Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan was the first Turkic ruler to convert Islam , most people of Central Asia soon followed . In the 12th century , Transoxania was conquered by Qara Khitai ( Western Liao ) , a sinicized Khitan dynasty , they brought to Central Asia the Chinese system of government . In the 13th century , Kara-Khanid Khanate was destroyed by the Turkic Khwarazmian dynasty , a vassal of the Qara Khitai .   Although Turko-Mongol infiltration into Central Asia had started early , as late as the 13th century when Turkic and Mongol armies finally conquered the entire region , the majority of Central Asia 's peoples were Iranian peoples such as Sogdians , Bactrians and , more ancient , the Saka–Massagetae tribes . It is generally believed that these ancient Indo-European-speaking peoples were linguistically assimilated by smaller but dominant Turkic-speaking groups while the sedentary population finally adopted the Persian language , the traditional lingua franca of the eastern Islamic lands . The language-shift from Middle Iranian to Turkic and New Persian was predominantly the result of an elite dominance process . This process was dramatically boosted during the Mongol conquest when millions were either killed or pushed further south to the Pamir region .   The modern Uzbek language is largely derived from the Chagatai language which gained prominence in the Timurid Empire . The position of Chagatai ( and later Uzbek ) was further strengthened after the fall of the Timurids and the rise of the Shaybanid Uzbek Khaqanate that finally shaped the Turkic language and identity of modern Uzbeks , while the unique grammatical and phonetical features of the Uzbek language as well as the modern Uzbek culture reflect the more ancient Iranian roots of the Uzbek people .   Genetic origins   The modern Uzbek population represents varying degrees of diversity derived from the high traffic invasion routes through Central Asia . Once populated by Iranian tribes and other Indo-European people , Central Asia experienced numerous invasions emanating out of Mongolia that would drastically affect the region . According to recent genetic genealogy testing from a University of Oxford study , the genetic admixture of the Uzbeks clusters somewhere between the Iranian peoples and the Mongols .   From the 3d century B.C. , Central Asia experienced nomadic expansions of Altaic-speaking oriental-looking people , and their incursions continued for hundreds of years , beginning with the Hsiung-Nu ( who may be ancestors of the Huns ) , in ~300 B.C. , and followed by the Turks , in the 1st millennium A.D. , and the Mongol expansions of the 13th century . High levels of haplogroup 10 [ C-M130 ] and its derivative , haplogroup 36 [ C-M210 ] , are found in most of the Altaic-speaking populations and are a good indicator of the genetic impact"], [144, "In music , dynamics are instructions in musical notation to the performer about hearing the loudness of a note or phrase . More generally , dynamics may also include other aspects of the execution of a given piece .   Relative loudness   The two basic dynamic indications in music are :  * p or piano , meaning `` soft '' .  * f or forte , meaning `` loud '' .   More subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by :  * mp , standing for mezzo-piano , meaning `` moderately soft '' .  * mf , standing for mezzo-forte , meaning `` moderately loud '' .   Beyond f and p , there are also  * pp , standing for `` pianissimo '' and meaning `` very soft '' .  * ff , standing for `` fortissimo '' and meaning `` very loud '' .  * ppp , standing for `` pianississimo '' and meaning `` very very soft '' .  * fff , standing for `` fortississimo '' and meaning `` very very loud '' .  And so on .   Some pieces contain dynamic designations with more than three f 's or p 's . In Holst 's The Planets , ffff occurs twice in Mars and once in Uranus often punctuated by organ and fff occurs several times throughout the work . It also appears in Heitor Villa-Lobos ' Bachianas Brasileiras No . 4 ( Prelude ) , and in Liszt 's Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale `` Ad nos , ad salutarem undam '' . The Norman Dello Joio Suite for Piano ends with a crescendo to a ffff , and Tchaikovsky indicated a bassoon solo pppppp ( 6 p 's ) in his Pathétique Symphony and ffff in passages of his 1812 Overture and the 2nd movement of his Fifth Symphony .   Igor Stravinsky used ffff at the end of the finale of the Firebird Suite . ffff is also found in a prelude by Rachmaninoff , op.3-2 . Shostakovich even went as loud as fffff ( 5 f 's ) in his fourth symphony . Gustav Mahler , in the third movement of his Seventh Symphony , gives the celli and basses a marking of fffff ( 5 f 's ) , along with a footnote directing 'pluck so hard that the strings hit the wood . ' On another extreme , Carl Nielsen , in the second movement of his Symphony No . 5 , marked a passage for woodwinds a diminuendo to ppppp ( 5 p 's ) .   Another more extreme dynamic is in György Ligeti 's Études No . 13 ( Devil 's Staircase ) , which has at one point a ffffff ( 6 f 's ) and progresses to a ffffffff ( 8 f 's ) . In Ligeti 's Études No . 9 , he uses pppppppp ( 8 p 's ) . In the baritone passage Era la notte from his opera Otello , Verdi uses pppp . Steane ( 1971 ) and others suggest that such markings are in reality a strong reminder to less than subtle singers to at least sing softly rather than an instruction to the singer actually to attempt a pppp .   Dynamic indications of this kind are relative , not absolute . mp does not indicate an exact level of volume , it merely indicates that music in a passage so marked should be a little louder than p and a little quieter than mf . Interpretations of dynamic levels are left mostly to the performer ; in the Barber Piano Nocturne , a phrase beginning pp is followed by a diminuendo leading to a mp marking . Another instance of performer 's discretion in this piece occurs when the left hand is shown to crescendo to a f , and then immediately after marked p while the right hand plays the melody f. It has been speculated that this is used simply to remind the performer to keep the melody louder than the harmonic line in the left hand .  In some music notation programs , there are default MIDI key velocity values associated with these indications , but more sophisticated programs allow users to change these as needed . Apple 's Logic Pro 9 uses the following values : ppp ( 16 ) , pp ( 32 ) , p ( 48 ) , mp ( 64 ) , mf ( 80 ) , f ( 96 ) , ff ( 112 ) , fff ( 127 ) .

Tool use by humans dates back millions of years , and other animals are also known to employ simple tools .   Tools that are used in particular fields or activities may have different designations such as `` instrument '' , `` utensil '' , `` implement '' , `` machine '' , `` device , '' or `` apparatus '' . The set of tools needed to achieve a goal is `` equipment '' . The knowledge of constructing , obtaining and using tools is technology .   History   Anthropologists believe that the use of tools was an important step in the evolution of mankind.Sam Lilley , [ https : //books.google.com/books ? id  Cj0EAAAAMAAJ & qtools+history & dq  tools+history & pgis=1 Men , Machines and History : The Story of Tools and Machines in Relation to Social Progress ] , 1948 Cobbett Press . Because tools are used extensively by both humans and wild chimpanzees , it is widely assumed that the first routine use of tools took place prior to the divergence between the two species . These early tools , however , were likely made of perishable materials such as sticks , or consisted of unmodified stones that can not be distinguished from other stones as tools .   Stone artifacts only date back to about 2.5 million years ago . However , a 2010 study suggests the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis ate meat by carving animal carcasses with stone implements . This finding pushes back the earliest known use of stone tools among hominins to about 3.4 million years ago .   Finds of actual tools date back at least 2.6 million years in Ethiopia . One of the earliest distinguishable stone tool forms is the hand axe .   Up until recently , weapons found in digs were the only tools of “ early man ” that were studied and given importance . Now , more tools are recognized as culturally and historically relevant . As well as hunting , other activities required tools such as preparing food , “ …nutting , leatherworking , grain harvesting and woodworking… ” Included in this group are “ flake stone tools '' .   Tools are the most important items that the ancient humans used to climb to the top of the food chain ; by inventing tools , they were able to accomplish tasks that human bodies could not , such as using a spear or bow and arrow to kill prey , since their teeth were not sharp enough to pierce many animals ' skins . “ Man the hunter ” as the catalyst for Hominin change has been questioned . Based on marks on the bones at archaeological sites , it is now more evident that pre-humans were scavenging off of other predators ' carcasses rather than killing their own food .   Mechanical devices experienced a major expansion in their use in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome with the systematic employment of new energy sources , especially waterwheels . Their use expanded through the Dark Ages with the addition of windmills .   Machine tools occasioned a surge in producing new tools in the industrial revolution . Advocates of nanotechnology expect a similar surge as tools become microscopic in size .   Functions   One can classify tools according to their basic functions :   * Cutting and edge tools , such as the knife , scythe or sickle , are wedge-shaped implements that produce a shearing force along a narrow face . Ideally , the edge of the tool needs to be harder than the material being cut or else the blade will become dulled with repeated use . But even resilient tools will require periodic sharpening , which is the process of removing deformation wear from the edge . Other examples of cutting tools include gouges and drill bits .  * Moving tools move large and tiny items . Many are levers which give the user a mechanical advantage . Examples of force-concentrating tools include the hammer which moves a nail or the maul which moves a stake . These operate by applying physical compression to a surface . In the case of the screwdriver , the force is rotational and called torque . By contrast , an anvil concentrates force on an object being hammered by preventing it from moving away when struck . Writing implements deliver a fluid to a surface via compression to activate the ink cartridge .

It was founded in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money for anti-famine efforts in Ethiopia by releasing the song `` Do They Know It 's Christmas ? '' for the Christmas market that year . On 25 November 1984 , the song was recorded at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill , London , and was released in the UK four days later . The single surpassed the hopes of the producers to become the Christmas number one on that release . Two subsequent re-recordings of the song to raise further money for charity also topped the charts . The original was produced by Midge Ure . The 12 '' version was mixed by Trevor Horn . In November 2014 , a new version of the song was recorded by artists under the name of Band Aid 30 .   Background   The supergroup was formed by Bob Geldof , former lead singer of Irish Band The Boomtown Rats . The BBC played a major role in capturing the poverty affecting Ethiopian citizens and thereby influenced Geldof to take action . Paula Yates , Bob Geldof ’ s partner , is considered to have been the brains behind the original Band Aid . It was she who became the driving force that inspired ( and helped ) Geldof to rally the most famous pop stars of the Eighties to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia .   The group was composed of forty artists to raise awareness and funds for the Ethiopian famine in 1983-1985 . The group 's name stemmed from the idea that the musicians were providing aid to the less fortunate and suggested that their project was likened to putting a band-aid on a wound . Geldof was looking for support from all nations for Africa beginning in the United Kingdom . To do so , the artists recorded a hit single titled `` Do They Know It ’ s Christmas ? '' depicting the poverty stricken African scenery of the time . Lyrics of the song included description of the country saying , “ where nothing ever grows , no rain or rivers flow , do they know it ’ s Christmas time at all ? ” Ethiopia follows the Orthodox calendar where Christmas is celebrated on the seventh of January .   Original Band Aid   Chronology ( 1984 )   Geldof was so moved by the plight of starving children in Ethiopia , that he decided to try to raise money using his contacts in pop music . Geldof enlisted the help of Midge Ure , from the group Ultravox , to produce a charity record . Ure took Geldof 's lyrics , and created the melody and backing track for the record . Geldof called many of the most popular British and Irish performers of the time , persuading them to give their time free . His one criterion for selection was how famous they were , in order to maximise sales of the record . He then kept an appointment to appear on a show on BBC Radio 1 , with Richard Skinner , but instead of promoting the new Boomtown Rats material as planned , he announced the plan for Band Aid . The recording studio gave Band Aid no more than 24 free hours to record and mix the record , on 25 November 1984 . The recording took place at SARM Studios in Notting Hill between 11am and 7pm , and was filmed by director Nigel Dick to be released as the pop video though some basic tracks had been recorded the day before at Midge Ure 's home studio . The first tracks to be recorded were the group / choir choruses which were filmed by the international press . The footage was rushed to newsrooms where it aired while the remainder of the recording process continued . Later , drums by Phil Collins were recorded . The introduction of the song features a slowed down sample from a Tears for Fears ' track called `` The Hurting '' , released in 1983 . Tony Hadley , of Spandau Ballet , was the first to record his vocal , while a section sung by Status Quo was deemed unusable , and replaced with section comprising Paul Weller , Sting , and Glenn Gregory , from Heaven 17 . Simon Le Bon from Duran Duran sang between contributions from George Michael and Sting . Paul Young has since admitted , in a documentary , that he knew his opening lines were written for David Bowie , who was not able to make"], [147, "Finland ( ; ; ) , officially the Republic of Finland , is a sovereign state in Europe . A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west , the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest , Norway to the north , and Russia to the east . Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland . Finland is situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia , which also includes Scandinavia . Finland 's population is 5.5 million ( 2014 ) , staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades . The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region . In terms of area , it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union .   Finland is a parliamentary republic with a central government based in the capital Helsinki , local governments in 317 municipalities , and an autonomous region , the Åland Islands . Over 1.4 million people live in the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area , which produces a third of the country 's GDP . From the late 12th century , Finland was an integral part of Sweden , a legacy reflected in the prevalence of the Swedish language and its official status . In the spirit of the notion of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson ( 1791–1858 ) , `` we are no-longer Swedes , we do not want to become Russians , let us therefore be Finns '' , the Finnish national identity started to establish . Nevertheless , in 1809 , Finland was incorporated into the Russian Empire as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland . In 1906 , Finland became the second nation in the world to give the right to vote to all adult citizens and the first in the world to give full suffrage to all adult citizens . Following the 1917 Russian Revolution , Finland declared itself independent .   In 1918 , the fledgling state was divided by civil war , with the Bolshevik-leaning `` Reds '' supported by the equally new Soviet Union , fighting the `` Whites '' , supported by the German Empire . After a brief attempt to establish a kingdom , the country became a republic . During World War II , the Soviet Union sought repeatedly to occupy Finland , with Finland losing parts of Karelia , Salla and Kuusamo , Petsamo and some islands , but retaining independence . Finland joined the United Nations in 1955 and established an official policy of neutrality . The Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948 gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics during the Cold War era . Finland joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) in 1969 , the NATO Partnership for Peace on 1994 , the European Union in 1995 , the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council in 1997 , and finally the Eurozone at its inception , in 1999 .   Finland was a relative latecomer to industrialization , remaining a largely agrarian country until the 1950s . It rapidly developed an advanced economy while building an extensive Nordic-style welfare state , resulting in widespread prosperity and one of the highest per capita incomes in the world . However , since 2012 Finnish GDP growth has been negative , with a preceding nadir of −8 % in 2009 . Finland is a top performer in numerous metrics of national performance , including education , economic competitiveness , civil liberties , quality of life , and human development . In 2015 , Finland was ranked first in the World Human Capital and the Press Freedom Index , and as the most stable country in the world in the Failed States Index , and second in the Global Gender Gap Report . A large majority of Finns are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church , though freedom of religion is guaranteed under the Finnish Constitution .   Etymology   Etymology   The first known written appearance of the name Finland is thought to be on three rune-stones . Two were found in the Swedish province of Uppland and have the inscription finlonti ( U 582 ) . The third was found in Gotland , in the Baltic Sea . It has the inscription finlandi ( G 319 ) and dates from the 13th century .

The genus Mustela includes the least weasels , polecats , stoats , ferrets , and minks . Members of this genus are small , active predators , with long and slender bodies and short legs . The family Mustelidae ( which also includes badgers , otters , and wolverines ) is often referred to as the `` weasel family '' . In the UK , the term `` weasel '' usually refers to the smallest species Mustela nivalis .   Weasels vary in length from 173 to , females being smaller than the males , and usually have red or brown upper coats and white bellies ; some populations of some species moult to a wholly white coat in winter . They have long , slender bodies , which enable them to follow their prey into burrows . Their tails may be from 34 to long .   Weasels feed on small mammals , and have from time to time been considered vermin , since some species took poultry from farms , or rabbits from commercial warrens . They do on the other hand eat large numbers of rodents . They can be found all across the world except for Antarctica , Australia , and neighbouring islands .   Terminology   The English word `` weasel '' was originally applied to one species of the genus , the European form of the least weasel ( Mustela nivalis ) . This usage is retained in British English , where the name is also extended to cover several other small species of the genus . However , in technical discourse and in American usage , the term `` weasel '' can refer to any member of the genus , or to the genus as a whole . Of the 17 extant species currently classified in the genus Mustela , 10 have `` weasel '' in their common names . Among those that do not are the stoat , the polecats , the ferret , and the European mink . The American mink and the extinct sea mink were commonly included in this genus as Mustela vison and Mustela macrodon respectively , but in 1999 were moved to the genus Neovison .   Species   The following information is according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System .   1 Europe and northern Asia division excludes China .   Hybrids in this genus include the polecat-ferret hybrid and the polecat-mink hybrid .   Cultural meanings   Weasels have been assigned a variety of cultural meanings .   In Greek culture , a weasel near one 's house is a sign of bad luck , even evil , `` especially if there is in the household a girl about to be married '' , since the animal ( based on its Greek etymology ) was thought to be an unhappy bride who was transformed into a weasel and consequently delights in destroying wedding dresses . In neighboring Macedonia , however , weasels are generally seen as an omen of good fortune .   In early modern Mecklenburg , Germany , amulets from weasels were deemed to have strong magic ; the period between August 15 and September 8 was specifically designated for the killing of weasels .   In Montagne Noire ( France ) , Ruthenia , and the early medieval culture of the Wends , weasels were not meant to be killed .   In North America , Native Americans deemed the weasel to be a bad sign ; crossing its path meant a `` speedy death '' . According to Daniel Defoe also , meeting a weasel is a bad omen . In English-speaking areas , weasel can be a disparaging term , noun or verb , for someone regarded as sneaky , conniving or untrustworthy . Similarly , weasel words is a critical term for words or phrasing that are vague , misleading or equivocal .   Japanese folklore   In Japan , were seen as yōkai from time immemorial , and they cause various strange occurrences . According to the encyclopedia Wakan Sansai Zue from the Edo period , a nate of weasels would cause conflagrations , and the cry of a weasel was considered a harbinger of misfortune . In the Niigata Prefecture , the sound of a nate of weasels making a rustle resembled six people hulling rice , so was called the `` '' , and it was an omen for one 's home to decline or flourish .

Santiago is located in the country 's central valley , at an elevation of 520 m above mean sea level .   Founded in 1541 , Santiago has been the capital city of Chile since colonial times . The city has a downtown core of 19th century neoclassical architecture and winding side-streets , dotted by art deco , neo-gothic , and other styles . Santiago 's cityscape is shaped by several stand-alone hills and the fast-flowing Mapocho River , lined by parks such as Parque Forestal . The Andes Mountains can be seen from most points in the city . These mountains contribute to a considerable smog problem , particularly during winter . The city outskirts are surrounded by vineyards and Santiago is within a few hours of both the mountains and the Pacific Ocean .   Santiago is the cultural , political and financial center of Chile and is home to the regional headquarters of many multinational corporations . The Chilean executive and judicial powers are located in Santiago , but Congress meets mostly in nearby Valparaíso . Santiago is named after the biblical figure St. James .   Nomenclature   In Chile , there are several entities which bear the name of `` Santiago '' that are often confused . The Commune of Santiago , sometimes referred to as `` downtown '' or `` Central Santiago '' ( Santiago Centro ) , is an administrative division that comprises roughly the area occupied by the city during its colonial period . The commune , administered by the Municipality of Santiago and headed by a mayor , is part of the Santiago Province headed by a provincial governor , which is in itself a subdivision of the Santiago Metropolitan Region headed by an intendant . Despite these classifications , when the term `` Santiago '' is used without another descriptor , it usually refers to what is also known as Greater Santiago ( Gran Santiago ) , a territorial extension defined by its urban continuity that includes the Commune of Santiago in addition to 36 other communes , which together comprise the majority of the Santiago Province and some areas of neighboring provinces ( see Political divisions ) .   The city and region 's demonym is santiaguinos ( male ) and santiaguinas ( female ) .   History   Founding of the city   According to certain archaeological investigations , it is believed that the first human groups of the X millennium settled in the Santiago basin . The groups were mainly nomadic hunter-gatherers , who traveled from the coast to the interior in search of guanacos during the time of the Andean snowmelt . About the year 800 , the first sedentary inhabitants began to settle due to the formation of agricultural communities along the Mapocho River , mainly maize , potatoes and beans , and the domestication of camelids in the area .   The villages established in the areas belonging to picunches groups ( name given by Chileans ) or promaucaes ( name given by Incas ) , were subject to the Inca Empire throughout the late fifteenth century and into the early sixteenth century . The Incas settled in the valley of mitimaes , the main installation settled in the center of the present city , with strengths as Huaca de Chena and the sanctuary of El Plomo hill . The area would have served as a basis for the failed Inca expeditions southward road junction as the Inca Trail .   Having been sent by Francisco Pizarro from Peru and having made the long journey from Cuzco , Extremadura conquistador Pedro de Valdivia reached the valley of the Mapocho on 13 December 1540 . The hosts of Valdivia camped by the river in the slopes of the Tupahue hill and slowly began to interact with the picunches natives who inhabited the area . Valdivia later summoned the chiefs of the area to a parliament , where he explained his intention to found a city on behalf of the king Carlos I of Spain , which would be the capital of his governorship of Nueva Extremadura . The natives accepted and even recommended the foundation of the town on a small island between two branches of the river next to a small hill called Huelén .   On 12 February 1541 , Valdivia officially founded the city of Santiago del Nuevo Extremo ( Santiago of New Extremadura ) in honor of St. James , patron saint of Spain , near the Huelén ,"], [151, "The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy ( sometimes referred to as HG2G , HHGTTG or H2G2 ) is a comedy science fiction series created by Douglas Adams . Originally a radio comedy broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1978 , it was later adapted to other formats , including stage shows , novels , comic book adaptations , a 1981 TV series , a 1984 computer game , and 2005 feature film . The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy has become an international multi-media phenomenon . The novels are the most widely distributed , having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005 .   The broad narrative follows the misadventures of the last surviving human , Arthur Dent , following the demolition of the planet Earth by a Vogon constructor fleet to make way for a hyperspace bypass . Dent is rescued from Earth 's destruction by Ford Prefect , a human-like alien writer for the fictional , eccentric , electronic travel guide , The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , by hitchhiking onto a passing spacecraft . Following his rescue , Dent explores the galaxy with Prefect and encounters Trillian , another human that had been taken from Earth prior to its destruction by the President of the Galaxy , the two-headed Zaphod Beeblebrox , and the depressed Marvin , the Paranoid Android . Certain narrative details were changed between the various adaptations .   Plot   The various versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory , as Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation . Throughout all versions , the series follows the adventures of Arthur Dent , a hapless Englishman , following the destruction of the Earth by the Vogons to make way for an intergalactic bypass . Dent 's adventures intersect with several other characters : Ford Prefect ( who named himself after the Ford Prefect car to blend in with what was assumed to be the dominant life form , automobiles ) , an alien from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and a researcher for the eponymous guidebook who rescues Dent from Earth 's destruction ; Zaphod Beeblebrox , Ford 's eccentric semi-cousin and the Galactic President ; the depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android ; and Trillian , formerly known as Tricia McMillan , a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington and the only other human survivor of Earth 's destruction thanks to Beeblebrox ' intervention .   Background   The first radio series comes from a proposal called `` The Ends of the Earth '' : six self-contained episodes , all ending with Earth 's being destroyed in a different way . While writing the first episode , Adams realized that he needed someone on the planet who was an alien to provide some context , and that this alien needed a reason to be there . Adams finally settled on making the alien a roving researcher for a `` wholly remarkable book '' named The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy . As the first radio episode 's writing progressed , the Guide became the centre of his story , and he decided to focus the series on it , with the destruction of Earth being the only hold-over .   Adams claimed that the title came from a 1971 incident while he was hitchhiking around Europe as a young man with a copy of the Hitch-hiker 's Guide to Europe book : while lying drunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking up at the stars , he thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy as well . However , he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten the incident itself , and only remembered himself telling the story . His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of `` hitch-hiking around the galaxy '' to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973 .   Adams 's fictional Guide is an electronic guidebook to the Milky Way galaxy , originally published by Megadodo Publications , one of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor Beta . The narrative of the various versions of the story are frequently punctuated with excerpts from the Guide . The voice of the Guide ( Peter Jones in the first two radio series and TV versions , later William Franklyn in the third , fourth and fifth radio series , and Stephen Fry in the movie version ) , also provides general narration .

With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Graeco-Roman art , still-life painting emerged as a distinct genre and professional specialization in Western painting by the late 16th century , and has remained significant since then . Still life gives the artist more freedom in the arrangement of elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as landscape or portraiture . Early still-life paintings , particularly before 1700 , often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted . Some modern still life breaks the two-dimensional barrier and employs three-dimensional mixed media , and uses found objects , photography , computer graphics , as well as video and sound .   Still life emerged from the painting of details in larger compositions with subjects , and historically has been often combined with figure subjects , especially in Flemish Baroque painting . The term includes the painting of dead animals , especially game . Live ones are considered animal art , although in practice they were often painted from dead models . The still-life category also shares commonalities with zoological and especially botanical illustration , where there has been considerable overlap among artists . Generally a still life includes a fully depicted background , and puts aesthetic rather than illustrative concerns as primary . Still life occupied the lowest rung of the hierarchy of genres , but still has been extremely popular with buyers . As well as the independent still-life subject , still-life painting encompasses other types of painting with prominent still-life elements , usually symbolic , and `` images that rely on a multitude of still-life elements ostensibly to reproduce a 'slice of life ' . The trompe-l'œil painting , which intends to deceive the viewer into thinking the scene is real , is a specialized type of still life , usually showing inanimate and relatively flat objects .   Antecedents and development   Still-life paintings often adorn the interior of ancient Egyptian tombs . It was believed that food objects and other items depicted there would , in the afterlife , become real and available for use by the deceased . Ancient Greek vase paintings also demonstrate great skill in depicting everyday objects and animals . Peiraikos is mentioned by Pliny the Elder as a panel painter of `` low '' subjects , such as survive in mosaic versions and provincial wall-paintings at Pompeii : `` barbers ' shops , cobblers ' stalls , asses , eatables and similar subjects '' . Similar still life , more simply decorative in intent , but with realistic perspective , have also been found in the Roman wall paintings and floor mosaics unearthed at Pompeii , Herculaneum and the Villa Boscoreale , including the later familiar motif of a glass bowl of fruit . Decorative mosaics termed `` emblema '' , found in the homes of rich Romans , demonstrated the range of food enjoyed by the upper classes , and also functioned as signs of hospitality and as celebrations of the seasons and of life . By the 16th century , food and flowers would again appear as symbols of the seasons and of the five senses . Also starting in Roman times is the tradition of the use of the skull in paintings as a symbol of mortality and earthly remains , often with the accompanying phrase Omnia mors aequat ( Death makes all equal ) . These vanitas images have been re-interpreted through the last 400 years of art history , starting with Dutch painters around 1600 .   The popular appreciation of the realism of still-life painting is related in the ancient Greek legend of Zeuxis and Parrhasius , who are said to have once competed to create the most lifelike objects , history ’ s earliest descriptions of trompe-l'œil painting . As Pliny the Elder recorded in ancient Roman times , Greek artists centuries earlier were already advanced in the arts of portrait painting , genre painting and still life . He singled out Peiraikos , `` whose artistry is surpassed by only a very few ... He painted barbershops and shoemakers ’ stalls , donkeys , vegetables , and such , and for that reason came to be called the ‘ painter of vulgar subjects ’ ; yet these works are altogether delightful , and they were sold at higher prices"], [153, "The Lake District , also known as The Lakes or Lakeland , is a mountainous region in North-West England . A popular holiday destination , it is famous for its lakes , forests and mountains ( or fells ) and its associations with the early 19th century writings of William Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets .   Historically split between Cumberland , Westmorland and Lancashire , the Lake District is now entirely in Cumbria . All the land in England higher than 3000 ft above sea level lies within the National Park , including Scafell Pike , the highest mountain in England . It also contains the deepest and longest bodies of water in England , respectively Wastwater and Windermere .   Lake District National Park   The Lake District National Park includes nearly all of the Lake District , though the town of Kendal and the Lakeland Peninsulas are currently outside the park boundary .   The area , which was designated a national park on 9 May 1951 ( less than a month after the first UK national park designation — the Peak District ) , is the most visited national park in the United Kingdom with 15.8 million annual visitors and more than 23 million annual day visits , the largest of the thirteen national parks in England and Wales , and the second largest in the UK after the Cairngorms . Its aim is to protect the landscape by restricting unwelcome change by industry or commerce . Most of the land in the park is in private ownership , with about 55 % registered as agricultural land . Landowners include :  * Individual farmers and other private landowners , with more than half of the agricultural land farmed by the owners .  * The National Trust owns about a quarter of the total area ( including some lakes and land of significant landscape value ) .  * The Forestry Commission and other investors in forests and woodland .  * United Utilities owns 8 %  * Lake District National Park Authority ( 3.9 % ) The National Park Authority is based at offices in Kendal . It runs a visitor centre on Windermere at a former country house called Brockhole , Coniston Boating Centre , and Information Centres . It is reducing its landholding .   In common with all other national parks in England , there is no restriction on entry to , or movement within the park along public routes , but access to cultivated land is usually restricted to public footpaths , bridleways and byways . Much of the uncultivated land has statutory open access rights - which cover around 50 % of the park .   The lakes and mountains combine to form impressive scenery . Farmland and settlement add aesthetic value to the natural scenery with an ecology modified by human influence for millennia and including important wildlife habitats . The Lake District failed in a previous attempt to gain World Heritage status as a natural World Heritage Site , because of human activities , such as commercial forestry , which have adversely impacted the park 's assessment . However , in 2016 the [ http : //www.lakesworldheritage.co.uk English Lake District bid ] for World Heritage Status was submitted to UNESCO in the category of cultural landscape . A decision is expected in 2017 .   Extension to the National Park   In December 2009 , Natural England proposed extending the National Park in the direction of the Yorkshire Dales National Park . This would include land of high landscape value in the Lune Valley . The proposal was opposed by Cumbria County Council who said it would lead to less democratic control and would make local housing less affordable . A public inquiry was held into the proposals , which required a decision by the Secretary of State . The decision to recommend approval was announced on October 23 , 2015 , and the size of the park increased by 3 % on 1 August 2016 .   Human geography   General   The precise extent of the Lake District was not defined traditionally , but is slightly larger than that of the National Park , the total area of which is about 885 sqmi . The park extends just over 32 mi from east to west and nearly 40 mi from north to south , with areas such as the Lake District Peninsulas to the south lying outside the National Park .   Settlement   The Lake District is one of the most highly populated national parks .

At the time , it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Camerinus and Flavus ( or , less frequently , year 264 Ab urbe condita ) .

Hippias , the aged ex-tyrant of Athens , is on one of the Persian ships in the hope of being restored to power in Athens .  * When the Ionian Greeks in Asia Minor rebelled against Persia in 499 BC , Eretria joined Athens in sending aid to the rebels . As a result , Darius makes a point of punishing Eretria during his invasion of Greece . The city is sacked and burned and Darius enslaves its inhabitants . He intends the same fate for Athens .  * September 12 – The Battle of Marathon takes place as a Persian army of more than 20,000 men is advised by Hippias to land in the Bay of Marathon , where they meet the Athenians supported by the Plataeans . The Persians are repulsed by 11,000 Greeks under the leadership of Callimachus and Miltiades . Some 6,400 Persians are killed at a cost of 192 Athenian dead . Callimachus , the war-archon of Athens , is killed in the battle . After the battle , the Persians return home .  * Before the Battle of Marathon , the Athenians send a runner , Pheidippides , to seek help from Sparta . However , the Spartans delay sending troops to Marathon because religious requirements ( the Carnea ) mean they must wait for the full moon .  * The Greek historian Herodotus , the main source for the Greco-Persian Wars , mentions Pheidippides as the messenger who runs from Athens to Sparta asking for help , and then runs back , a distance of over 240 kilometres each way . After the battle , he runs back to Athens to spread the news and raise the spirits . It is claimed that his last words before collapsing and dying in Athens are `` Chairete , nikomen '' ( `` Rejoice , we are victorious '' ) .  * Hippias dies at Lemnos on the journey back to Sardis after the Persian defeat .  * Cleomenes I is forced to flee Sparta when his plot against Demaratus is discovered , but the Spartans allow him to return when he begins gathering an army in the surrounding territories .

Metals are generally malleable — that is , they can be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking — as well as fusible ( able to be fused or melted ) and ductile ( able to be drawn out into a thin wire ) . About 91 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals , the others are nonmetals or metalloids . Some elements appear in both metallic and non-metallic forms .   Astrophysicists use the term `` metal '' to collectively describe all elements other than hydrogen and helium . In that sense , the metallicity of an object is the proportion of its matter made up of chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium .   Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures ; these are formed as metallic allotropes of non-metals .   Structure and bonding   The atoms of metallic substances are typically arranged in one of three common crystal structures , namely body-centered cubic ( bcc ) , face-centered cubic ( fcc ) , and hexagonal close-packed ( hcp ) . In bcc , each atom is positioned at the center of a cube of eight others . In fcc and hcp , each atom is surrounded by twelve others , but the stacking of the layers differs . Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature .   Atoms of metals readily lose their outer shell electrons , resulting in a free flowing cloud of electrons within their otherwise solid arrangement . This provides the ability of metallic substances to easily transmit heat and electricity . While this flow of electrons occurs , the solid characteristic of the metal is produced by electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud . This type of bond is called a metallic bond .   Properties   Chemical   Metals are usually inclined to form cations through electron loss , reacting with oxygen in the air to form oxides over various timescales ( iron rusts over years , while potassium burns in seconds ) . Examples :   4 Na + O2 → 2 Na2O ( sodium oxide )  2 Ca + O2 → 2 CaO ( calcium oxide )  4 Al + 3 O2 → 2 Al2O3 ( aluminium oxide ) .   The transition metals ( such as iron , copper , zinc , and nickel ) are slower to oxidize because they form a passivating layer of oxide that protects the interior . Others , like palladium , platinum and gold , do not react with the atmosphere at all . Some metals form a barrier layer of oxide on their surface which can not be penetrated by further oxygen molecules and thus retain their shiny appearance and good conductivity for many decades ( like aluminium , magnesium , some steels , and titanium ) . The oxides of metals are generally basic , as opposed to those of nonmetals , which are acidic . Exceptions are largely oxides with very high oxidation states such as CrO3 , Mn2O7 , and OsO4 , which have strictly acidic reactions .   Painting , anodizing or plating metals are good ways to prevent their corrosion . However , a more reactive metal in the electrochemical series must be chosen for coating , especially when chipping of the coating is expected . Water and the two metals form an electrochemical cell , and if the coating is less reactive than the coatee , the coating actually promotes corrosion .   Physical   Metals in general have high electrical conductivity , high thermal conductivity , and high density . Typically they are malleable and ductile , deforming under stress without cleaving . In terms of optical properties , metals are shiny and lustrous . Sheets of metal beyond a few micrometres in thickness appear opaque , but gold leaf transmits green light .   Although most metals have higher densities than most nonmetals , there is wide variation in their densities , lithium being the least dense solid element and osmium the densest . The alkali and alkaline earth metals in groups I A and II A are referred to as the light metals because they have low density , low hardness , and low melting points . The high density of most metals is due to the tightly"], [156, "The Flemish Giant is a breed of domestic rabbit ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ) known for its large size .   History   The Flemish Giant originated in Flanders . It was bred as early as the 16th century near the city of Ghent , Belgium . It is believed to have descended from a number of meat and fur breeds , possibly including the Steenkonijn ( Stone Rabbit—referring to the old Belgian weight size of one stone or about ) and the European `` Patagonian '' breed ( now extinct ) . This `` Patagonian '' rabbit , a large breed that was once bred in Belgium and France , was not related to the Patagonian rabbit of Argentina ( Sylvilagus brasiliensis ) , a separate wild species weighing less than two pounds ( about 1 kg ) , nor the Patagonian hare ( Dolichotis patagonum ) , a species in the cavy family of rodents that can not interbreed with rabbits .  Thomas Coatoam , in his Origins of the Flemish Giants , tells us , `` The earliest authentic record of the Flemish Giant Rabbit occurred about the year 1860 . ''    The first standards for the breed were written in 1893 . The Flemish Giant is an ancestor of many rabbit breeds all over the world , one of which is the Belgian Hare , imported into England in the mid 19th century . The Flemish Giant was exported from England and Belgium to America in the early 1890s to help improve the size of meat rabbits during the great `` rabbit boom '' .   It received little attention until about 1910 where it started appearing at small livestock shows throughout the country . Today , it is one of the more popular breeds at rabbit shows because of its unusually large size and its varying colors . It is promoted by the National Federation of Flemish Giant Rabbit Breeders , which was formed in 1915 . The Flemish Giant has many nicknames , first and foremost the `` Gentle Giant '' for its uniquely docile personality and also the `` universal rabbit '' for its varied purposes as pet , show , breeding , meat and fur animal .   Appearance   As one of the largest breeds of domestic rabbit , the Flemish Giant is a semi-arch type rabbit with its back arch starting in back of the shoulders and carrying through to the base of the tail giving a `` mandolin '' shape . The body of a Flemish Giant Rabbit is long and powerful , with relatively broad hindquarters . The fur of the Flemish Giant is known to be glossy and dense . When stroked from the hindquarters to the head , the fur will roll back to its original position .   Bucks have a broad , massive head in comparison to does , and can take 1.5 years to reach full maturity . Does may have a large , full , evenly carried dewlap ( the fold of skin under their chins ) , and can take 1 year to reach their full maturity .   Flemish Giant Rabbits weigh 15 pounds on average , though the biggest ones can weigh up to 22 lb , and the longest one on record ( in fact , holding the record for the longest rabbit in the world of any kind ) , measured about 32 inches long .   The American Rabbit Breed Association ( ARBA ) standard recognized seven different colors for this breed : black , blue , fawn , sandy , light gray , steel gray , and white . The show standard minimum weight for a senior doe is 14 lb ( about 6.4 kg ) , and the show standard minimum weight of a Senior buck is 13 lb ( about 5.9 kg ) .   Behavior and lifestyle   Flemish Giants can be docile and tolerant of handling ; frequent interaction with humans is a requirement for this to occur . Flemish Giants , like all rabbits , can become fearful , and sometimes aggressive , if handled incorrectly or irresponsibly . Their larger frame requires special attention paid to the spine alignment when handling a Flemish Giant , or any rabbit for that matter . Consequently , potential owners should consider these factors in addition to their size , level of food consumption , and substantial waste production before buying .   Due to its large size , the Flemish Giant needs substantial living quarters that provide ample opportunity for physical movement .

He is also known for the Dickens adaptations of Great Expectations ( 1946 ) and Oliver Twist ( 1948 ) , as well as the romantic drama Brief Encounter ( 1945 ) .   Lauded by directors such as Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick , Lean was voted 9th greatest film director of all time in the British Film Institute Sight & Sound `` Directors ' Top Directors '' poll 2002 . Nominated seven times for the Academy Award for Best Director , which he won twice for The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia , he has three films in the top five of the British Film Institute 's Top 100 British Films . and was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1990 .   Early life and education   Lean was born in Croydon , Surrey ( now part of Greater London ) , to Francis William le Blount Lean and the former Helena Tangye ( niece of Sir Richard Trevithick Tangye ) . His parents were Quakers and he was a pupil at the Quaker-founded Leighton Park School in Reading . His younger brother , Edward Tangye Lean ( 1911–1974 ) , founded the original Inklings literary club when a student at Oxford University . Lean was a half-hearted schoolboy with a dreamy nature who was labeled a `` dud '' of a student ; he left in his mid-teens and entered his father 's chartered accountancy firm as an apprentice . A more formative event for his career than his formal education was an uncle 's gift , when Lean was aged ten , of a Brownie box camera . `` You usually did n't give a boy a camera until he was 16 or 17 in those days . It was a huge compliment and I succeeded at it . ' Lean printed and developed his films , and it was his 'great hobby ' . At age 16 , his father deserted the family when he ran off with another woman , and Lean would later follow a similar path after his own first marriage and child .   Period as film editor   Bored by his work , Lean spent every evening in the cinema , and in 1927 , after an aunt had advised him to find a job he enjoyed doing , he went to Gaumont Studios where his obvious enthusiasm earned him a month 's trial without pay . He was taken on as a teaboy , promoted to clapperboy , and soon rose to the position of third assistant director . By 1930 he was working as an editor on newsreels , including those of Gaumont Pictures and Movietone , while his move to feature films began with Freedom of the Seas ( 1934 ) and Escape Me Never ( 1935 ) .   He edited Gabriel Pascal 's film productions of two George Bernard Shaw plays , Pygmalion ( 1938 ) and Major Barbara ( 1941 ) . He edited Powell & Pressburger 's 49th Parallel ( 1941 ) and One of Our Aircraft Is Missing ( 1942 ) . After this last film , Lean began his directing career , after editing more than two dozen features by 1942 . As Tony Sloman wrote in 1999 , `` As the varied likes of David Lean , Robert Wise , Terence Fisher and Dorothy Arzner have proved , the cutting rooms are easily the finest grounding for film direction . '' David Lean was given honorary membership of the Guild of British Film Editors in 1968 .

A white dwarf is very dense : its mass is comparable to that of the Sun , while its volume is comparable to that of Earth . A white dwarf 's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy ; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy . The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B , at 8.6 light years , the smaller component of the Sirius binary star . There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun . The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910 . The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922 . The universe has not existed long enough to experience a white dwarf releasing all of its energy as it will take close to a trillion years .   White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star , including the Earth 's Sun and over 97 % of the other stars in the Milky Way. , §1 . After the hydrogen-fusing period of a main-sequence star of low or medium mass ends , such a star will expand to a red giant during which it fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core by the triple-alpha process . If a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon , around 1 billion K , an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center . After a star sheds its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula , it will leave behind this core , which is the remnant white dwarf . Usually , therefore , white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen . If the mass of the progenitor is between 8 and 10.5 solar masses ( ) , the core temperature is sufficient to fuse carbon but not neon , in which case an oxygen–neon–magnesium white dwarf may form . Stars of very low mass will not be able to fuse helium , hence , a helium white dwarf may form by mass loss in binary systems .   The material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions , so the star has no source of energy . As a result , it can not support itself by the heat generated by fusion against gravitational collapse , but is supported only by electron degeneracy pressure , causing it to be extremely dense . The physics of degeneracy yields a maximum mass for a non-rotating white dwarf , the Chandrasekhar limit—approximately 1.46 —beyond which it can not be supported by electron degeneracy pressure . A carbon-oxygen white dwarf that approaches this mass limit , typically by mass transfer from a companion star , may explode as a type Ia supernova via a process known as carbon detonation . ( SN 1006 is thought to be a famous example . )   A white dwarf is very hot when it forms , but because it has no source of energy , it will gradually radiate its energy and cool . This means that its radiation , which initially has a high color temperature , will lessen and redden with time . Over a very long time , a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize ( starting with the core ) . The star 's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light , and it will become a cold black dwarf . The length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe ( approximately 13.8 billion years ) , and it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist . The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvin .   Discovery   The first white dwarf discovered was in the triple star system of 40 Eridani , which contains the relatively bright main sequence star 40 Eridani A , orbited at a distance by the closer binary system of the white dwarf 40 Eridani B and the main sequence red dwarf 40 Eridani C. The pair 40 Eridani B/C was discovered by William Herschel on 31 January 1783 ; , p. 73 it was again observed by Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve in 1825 and by Otto Wilhelm von Struve in 1851 . In 1910 , Henry Norris Russell , Edward Charles Pickering and Williamina Fleming discovered"], [160, "Sid James ( born Solomon Joel Cohen ; 8 May 1913 – 26 April 1976 ) was a South African-born British actor and comedian .   Appearing in British films from 1947 , he was cast in numerous small and supporting roles into the 1960s . His profile was raised as Tony Hancock 's co-star in Hancock 's Half Hour , which ran on television from 1956 until 1960 , and then he became known as a regular performer in the Carry On films , appearing in 19 films of the series with the top billing role in 17 ( in the other two he was cast below Frankie Howerd ) . Meanwhile , his starring roles in television sitcoms continued for the rest of his life . He starred alongside Diana Coupland in the 1970s sitcom Bless This House which aired from 1971 until James died in 1976 .   Remembered for a lascivious persona , the Snopes website describing him as `` the grand old man of dirty laughter '' , he became known for his amiability in his later television work . Bruce Forsyth described him as `` a natural at being natural . ''   On 26 April 1976 , James was touring in The Mating Season , appearing at the Sunderland Empire Theatre when he died from a heart attack . Some , including comedian Les Dawson , claim to have seen the ghost of James at the theatre .   Early life   James was born Solomon Joel Cohen , on 8 May 1913 , to Jewish parents , in South Africa , later changing his name to Sidney Joel Cohen , and then Sidney James . His family lived on Hancock Street in Hillbrow , Johannesburg . Upon moving to Britain later in life , he claimed various previous occupations , including diamond cutter , dance tutor and boxer ; in reality , he had trained and worked as a hairdresser .   It was at a hairdressing salon in Kroonstad , Orange Free State , that he met his first wife . He married Berthe Sadie Delmont , known as Toots , on 12 August 1936 and they had a daughter , Elizabeth , born in 1937 . His father-in-law , Joseph Delmont , a Johannesburg businessman , bought a hairdressing salon for James , but within a year he announced that he wanted to become an actor and joined the Johannesburg Repertory Players . Through this group he gained work with the South African Broadcasting Corporation .   During the Second World War he served as a lieutenant in an entertainment unit of the South African Army , and subsequently took up acting as a career . He moved to Britain immediately after the war , financed by his service gratuity . According to rumour , Sid had an affair with the daughter of an important member of Johannesburg society ; his decision to move away from South Africa was partly because he was `` advised '' to leave due to the possible controversy . Initially he worked in repertory before being spotted for the nascent British post-war film industry .   From 1947 to 1964   James made his first credited film appearances in Night Beat and Black Memory ( 1947 ) , both crime dramas . He played the alcoholic hero 's barman in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger 's The Small Back Room ( 1949 ) .   His first major comedy role was in The Lavender Hill Mob ( 1951 ) : with Alfie Bass he made up the bullion robbery gang headed by Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway . In the same year he also appeared in Lady Godiva Rides Again and The Galloping Major . In 1953 he appeared as Harry Hawkins in The Titfield Thunderbolt . In 1956 he appeared in Trapeze ( 1956 ) , a circus film which was one of the most successful films of its year , and played Master Henry in `` Outlaw Money '' an episode of The Adventures of Robin Hood . He also had a supporting part as a TV advertisement producer in Charlie Chaplin 's A King in New York , a non-comic supporting role as a journalist in the science-fiction film Quatermass 2 and performed in Hell Drivers ( all 1957 ) , a film with Stanley Baker . The next year , James starred with Miriam Karlin in East End , West End by Wolf Mankowitz , a half-hour comedy series for the ITV company Associated Rediffusion . Set within the Jewish community of London 's East End , the series of six episodes was transmitted in February and March 1958 , but"], [161, "Edward Regan `` Eddie '' Murphy ( born April 3 , 1961 ) is an American comedian , an actor , a writer , a singer , and a producer .   He was a regular cast member on Saturday Night Live from 1980 to 1984 . He has worked as a stand-up comedian , and was ranked # 10 on Comedy Central 's list of the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time .   In films , he has received Golden Globe Award nominations for his performances in 48 Hrs. , the Beverly Hills Cop series , Trading Places , and The Nutty Professor . In 2007 , he won the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of soul singer James `` Thunder '' Early in Dreamgirls .   His work as a voice actor in films includes : Thurgood Stubbs in The PJs , Donkey in DreamWorks ' Shrek series , and the Chinese dragon Mushu in Disney 's Mulan . In some films , he plays multiple roles in addition to his main character , intended as a tribute to one of his idols Peter Sellers , who played multiple roles in Dr. Strangelove and elsewhere . He has played multiple roles in Coming to America , Wes Craven 's Vampire in Brooklyn , the Nutty Professor films ( where he played the title role in two incarnations , plus his character 's father , brother , mother , and grandmother ) , Bowfinger , The Adventures of Pluto Nash , Norbit , and Meet Dave .   As of 2014 , Murphy 's films have grossed over $ 3.8 billion in the United States and Canada box office , and $ 6.6 billion worldwide . In 2015 , his films made him the 6th-highest grossing actor in the United States .   Murphy was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts .   Early life   Murphy was born in Brooklyn , New York City , and raised in the borough 's Bushwick neighborhood . His mother , Lillian , was a telephone operator , and his father , Charles Edward Murphy , was a transit police officer and an amateur actor and comedian .   His father died when he was young .  When Murphy 's single mother became ill , the eight-year-old and his older brother lived in foster care for one year . In interviews , Murphy has said that his time in foster care was influential in developing his sense of humor . Later , he and his older brother Charlie were raised in Roosevelt , New York by his mother and stepfather Vernon Lynch , a foreman at an ice cream plant .   Around the age of 15 , Murphy was writing and performing his own routines , which were heavily influenced by Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor .   Career   Stand-up comedy   His early comedy was characterized by frequent swearing and sketches lampooning a diverse group of people ( including White Anglo-Saxon Protestants ( WASPs ) , African Americans , Italian Americans , overweight people , and gay people ) . Murphy released two stand-up specials . Eddie Murphy was his first album , released in 1982 . Delirious was filmed in 1983 in Washington , D.C. Due to the popularity of Delirious , his concert film Eddie Murphy Raw ( 1987 ) received a wide theatrical release , grossing $ 50 million ; the movie was filmed in the Felt Forum section of Madison Square Garden in New York .   1980s acting career   Murphy first earned national attention as a cast member on Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) , and was credited with helping to revitalize the show during the early 1980s . His notable characters included a grownup version of the Little Rascals character Buckwheat ; a street-wise children 's show host named Mr. Robinson ( a spoof of Fred Rogers , who found it amusing ) ; and a morose , cynical Gumby , whose trademark slogan became an SNL catchphrase : `` I 'm Gumby , dammit ! ''   The Buckwheat character was retired in spectacular fashion—assassinated , on camera , in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza—at Murphy 's request , after he grew tired of constant demands from fans to `` Do Buckwheat ! Do Buckwheat ! '' In Rolling Stone magazine 's February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to date , Murphy was ranked second ( behind John Belushi ) . ``"], [162, "The piano is a musical instrument played using a keyboard , which is a row of keys ( small levers ) that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands . Invented in about 1700 ( the exact date is uncertain ) , the piano is widely employed in classical , jazz , traditional and popular music for solo and ensemble performances , accompaniment , and for composing and rehearsal . Although the piano is not portable and is often expensive , its versatility , wide range , ability to play chords , ability to play louder or softer , the large number of musicians trained in playing it and its ubiquity in performance venues and rehearsal spaces have made it one of the Western world 's most familiar musical instruments .   An acoustic piano usually has a protective wooden case surrounding the soundboard and metal strings , and a row of 88 black and white keys ( 52 white keys for the note of the C Major scale and 36 shorter black keys , which are higher than the white keys , for the `` accidental '' notes , which are the sharp and flat notes needed to play in all 12 keys ) . The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed or struck , and silenced by a damper when the keys are released . The notes can be sustained , even when the keys are released , by the use of pedals at the base of the instrument . Unlike two of the major keyboard instruments that preceded the piano , the pipe organ and the harpsichord , the weight or force with which a performer presses or strikes the keys changes the dynamics and tone of the instrument .   Pressing one or more keys on the piano 's keyboard causes a padded hammer ( often padded with firm felt ) to strike the strings . The hammer rebounds from the strings , and the strings continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency . These vibrations are transmitted through a bridge to a soundboard that amplifies by more efficiently coupling the acoustic energy to the air . When the key is released , a damper stops the strings ' vibration , ending the sound . Although an acoustic piano has strings , it is usually classified as a percussion instrument rather than as a stringed instrument , because the strings are struck rather than plucked ( as with a harpsichord or spinet ) ; in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification , pianos are considered chordophones . With technological advances , Electric pianos ( 1929 ) , electronic ( 1970s ) , and digital pianos ( 1980s ) have also been developed . The electric piano became a popular instrument in the 1960s and 1970s genres of jazz fusion and rock music .   The word piano is a shortened form of pianoforte , the Italian term for the instrument , which in turn derives from gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano . The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate `` soft '' and `` loud '' respectively , in this context referring to the variations in volume produced in response to a pianist 's touch on the keys : the greater the velocity of a key press , the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings , and the louder the sound of the note produced .   History   The piano was founded on earlier technological innovations in keyboard instruments . The first string instruments with struck strings were the hammered dulcimers , which were used since the Middle Ages in Europe . During the Middle Ages , there were several attempts at creating stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings . By the 17th century , the mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the clavichord and the harpsichord were well developed . In a clavichord , the strings are struck by tangents , while in a harpsichord , they are mechanically plucked by quills when the performer depresses the key . Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case , soundboard , bridge , and mechanical action for a keyboard intended to sound strings .   Invention   The invention of the modern piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori ( 1655–1731 ) of Padua , Italy , who was employed by Ferdinando de ' Medici , Grand Prince of Tuscany , as the Keeper of the Instruments ; he was an expert harpsichord maker , and was well acquainted with the body of knowledge on stringed keyboard instruments . It is"], [163, "The Most Noble Order of the Garter , founded in 1348 , is the highest order of chivalry and the third most prestigious honour ( inferior only to the Victoria Cross and George Cross ) in England and the United Kingdom . It is dedicated to the image and arms of Saint George , England 's patron saint .   It is awarded at the Sovereign 's pleasure as a personal gift on recipients from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms . Membership of the Order is limited to the Sovereign , the Prince of Wales , and no more than 24 members , or Companions . The order also includes supernumerary knights and ladies ( e.g . members of the British Royal Family and foreign monarchs ) .   New appointments to the Order of the Garter are always announced on St George 's Day ( 23 April ) , as Saint George is the order 's patron saint .   The order 's emblem is a garter with the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense ( Middle French : `` shame on him who thinks evil of it '' ) in gold lettering . Members of the order wear it on ceremonial occasions .   History   King Edward III founded the Order of the Garter around the time of his claim to the French throne . The year is usually presumed to be 1348 , however , the Complete Peerage , under `` The Founders of the Order of the Garter '' , states the order was first instituted on 23 April 1344 , listing each founding member as knighted in 1344 . The list includes Sir Sanchet D'Abrichecourt , who died on 20 October 1345 . Other dates from 1344 to 1351 have also been proposed . The King 's wardrobe account shows Garter habits first issued in the autumn of 1348 . Also , its original statutes required that each member of the Order already be a knight ( what would now be referred to as a knight bachelor ) and some of the initial members listed were only knighted that year .   The earliest written mention of the Order is found in Tirant lo Blanch , a chivalric romance written in Catalan mainly by Valencian Joanot Martorell . It was first published in 1490 . This book devotes a chapter to the description of the origin of the Order of the Garter .   List of Founder Knights   At the time of its foundation , the Order consisted of King Edward III , together with 25 Founder Knights , listed in ascending order of stall number in St. George 's Chapel :  * King Edward III ( 1312–77 )  * Edward , the Black Prince , Prince of Wales ( 1330–76 )  * Henry of Grosmont , Earl of Lancaster ( c. 1310–61 )  * Thomas , Earl of Warwick ( d. 1369 )  * Jean de Grailly , Captal de Buch ( d. 1377 )  * Ralph , Lord Stafford ( 1301–72 )  * William , Earl of Salisbury ( 1328–97 )  * Roger , Earl of March ( 1328–60 )  * John , Lord Lisle ( 1318–56 )  * Bartholomew , Lord Burghersh ( d. 1369 )  * John , Lord Beauchamp ( d. 1360 )  * John , Lord Mohun ( c. 1320–76 )  * Sir Hugh de Courtenay ( d. 1349 )  * Thomas , Earl of Kent ( 1314-1360 )  * John , Lord Grey de Rotherfield ( c. 1300–59 )  * Sir Richard Fitz-Simon ( b . 1295 )  * Sir Miles Stapleton ( d. 1364 )  * Sir Thomas Wale ( d. 1352 )  * Sir Hugh Wrottesley ( d. 1381 )  * Sir Nele Loring ( d. 1386 )  * Sir John Chandos ( d. 1369 )  * Sir James Audley ( d. 1369 )  * Sir Otho Holand ( d. 1359 )  * Sir Henry Eam ( d. before 1360 )  * Sir Sanchet D'Abrichecourt ( d. 1345 )  * Sir Walter Paveley ( d. 1375 )  They are all depicted in individual portraits in the Bruges Garter Book made c. 1431 .   Legendary origins   Various legends account for the origin of the Order . The most popular legend involves the `` Countess of Salisbury '' ( either Edward 's future daughter-in-law Joan of Kent or her former mother-in-law , Catherine Montacute , Countess of Salisbury ) .

It is the most popular vin de primeur , fermented for just a few weeks before being released for sale on the third Thursday of November . This `` Beaujolais Nouveau Day '' used to see heavy marketing , with races to get the first bottles to different markets around the globe . The current release practice is to ship the wine ahead of the third Thursday of November , and release it to the local markets at 12:01 a.m. local time .   History   Beaujolais had always made a vin de l'année to celebrate the end of the harvest , but until WWII it was only for local consumption . In fact , once the Beaujolais AOC was established in 1937 , AOC rules meant that Beaujolais wine could only be officially sold after 15 December in the year of harvest . Warning - plays music by default These rules were relaxed on 13 November 1951 , and the Union Interprofessionnelle des Vins du Beaujolais ( UIVB ) formally set 15 November as the release date for what would henceforth be known as Beaujolais nouveau .   A few members of the UIVB saw the potential for marketing Beaujolais nouveau . Not only was it a way to clear lots of vin ordinaire at a good profit , but selling wine within weeks of the harvest was great for cash flow . Hence the idea was born of a race to Paris carrying the first bottles of the new vintage . This attracted a lot of media coverage , and by the 1970s had become a national event . The races spread to neighbouring countries in Europe in the 1980s , followed by North America , and in the 1990s to Asia . In 1985 , the date was changed to the third Thursday in November to take best advantage of marketing in the following weekend .   Production   Beaujolais nouveau is made from the Gamay noir à Jus blanc grape , better known simply as Gamay . The grapes must come from the Beaujolais AOC , with those of the ten `` cru '' appellations excluded . They are grown in `` stony , schistous soils '' . Both Beaujolais Nouveau and Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau are produced ; the latter comes from the ~ 30 non-cru villages in the region .   By law , all grapes in the region must be harvested by hand . The wine is made using carbonic maceration , whole berry anaerobic fermentation which emphasizes fruit flavors without extracting bitter tannins from the grape skins . Grapes are loaded into a large ( think 20,000 gallon ) sealed container that is filled with carbon dioxide . Grapes that are gently crushed at the bottom of the container by the weight of the grapes start to ferment , emitting more CO2 . All this carbon dioxide causes fermentation to take place inside the uncrushed grapes ( without access to oxygen , hence `` anaerobic fermentation '' ) . The resulting wine is fresh , fruity , and very low in tannins .   Celebration    This `` Beaujolais Day '' is accompanied by publicity events and heavy advertising . The traditional slogan , even in English-speaking countries , was `` Le Beaujolais nouveau est arrivé ! '' ( literally , `` The new Beaujolais has arrived ! `` ) , but in 2005 this was changed to `` It 's Beaujolais Nouveau Time ! `` . In the United States , it is promoted as a drink for Thanksgiving , which always falls exactly one week after the wine is released ( on the fourth Thursday of November ) . Many producers release the nouveau with colourful or abstract design that changes every year , usually as an evolution from the previous year 's design . Duboeuf has silk ties made each year with their label 's abstract design , and releases them through select wholesalers and distributors .   Style   Beaujolais nouveau is a purple-pink wine reflecting its youth , bottled only 6-8 weeks after harvest . The method of production means that there is very little tannin , and the wine can be dominated by such fruity ester flavours as banana , grape , strawberry , fig and pear drop . The wine is recommended to be slightly chilled to 13°C ( 55°F ) .   Beaujolais nouveau is intended for immediate drinking . While some nouveau can be kept for a few years , there 's no real reason to , as it does n't improve with age ."], [165, "Fountains Abbey is one of the largest and best preserved ruined Cistercian monasteries in England . It is located approximately 3 mi south-west of Ripon in North Yorkshire , near to the village of Aldfield . Founded in 1132 , the abbey operated for over 400 years , until 1539 , when Henry VIII ordered the Dissolution of the Monasteries .   The abbey is a Grade I listed building owned by the National Trust and part of the designated Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey UNESCO World Heritage Site .   History   After a dispute and riot in 1132 at the Benedictine house of St Mary 's Abbey , in York , 13 monks were expelled ( among them Saint Robert of Newminster ) and , after unsuccessfully attempting to return to the early 6th-century Rule of St Benedict , were taken into the protection of Thurstan , Archbishop of York . He provided them with land in the valley of the River Skell , a tributary of the Ure . The enclosed valley had all the natural features needed for the creation of a monastery , providing shelter from the weather , stone and timber for building , and a supply of running water . After enduring a harsh winter in 1133 , the monks applied to join the Cistercian order and in 1135 became the second house of that order in northern England , after Rievaulx . The monks subjected themselves to Clairvaux Abbey , in Burgundy which was under the rule of St Bernard . Under the guidance of Geoffrey of Ainai , a monk sent from Clairvaux , the group learned how to celebrate the seven Canonical Hours and were shown how to construct wooden buildings in accordance with Cistercian practice .   After Henry Murdac was elected to the abbacy in 1143 , the small stone church and timber claustral buildings were replaced . Within three years , an aisled nave had been added to the stone church , and the first permanent claustral buildings built in stone and roofed in tile had been completed .   In 1146 an angry mob , displeased with Murdac 's role in opposing the election of William FitzHerbert to the archbishop of York , attacked the abbey and burnt down all but the church and some surrounding buildings . The community recovered swiftly from the attack and founded four daughter houses . Henry Murdac resigned the abbacy in 1147 to become the Archbishop of York and was replaced first by Maurice , Abbot of Rievaulx then , on the resignation of Maurice , by Thorald . Thorald was forced by Henry Murdac to resign after two years in office . The next abbot , Richard , held the post until his death in 1170 and restored the abbey 's stability and prosperity . In 20 years as abbot , he supervised a huge building programme which involved completing repairs to the damaged church and building more accommodation for the increasing number of recruits . Only the chapter house was completed before he died and the work was ably continued by his successor , Robert of Pipewell , under whose rule the abbey gained a reputation for caring for the needy .   The next abbot was William who presided over the abbey from 1180 to 1190 and he was succeeded by Ralph Haget , who had entered Fountains at the age of 30 as a novice , after pursuing a military career . During the European famine of 1194 Haget ordered the construction of shelters in the vicinity of the abbey and provided daily food rations to the poor enhancing the abbey 's reputation for caring for the poor and attracting more grants from wealthy benefactors .   In the first half of the 13th century Fountains increased in reputation and prosperity under the next three abbots , John of York ( 1203–1211 ) , John of Hessle ( 1211–1220 ) and John of Kent ( 1220–1247 ) . They were burdened with an inordinate amount of administrative duties and increasing demands for money in taxation and levies but managed to complete another massive expansion of the abbey 's buildings . This included enlarging the church and building an infirmary . In the second half of the 13th century the abbey was in more straitened circumstances . It was presided over by eleven abbots , and became financially unstable largely due to forward selling its wool crop , and the abbey was criticised for its dire material and physical state when it was visited by Archbishop John Romeyn in 1294 . The run of disasters that befell the community continued into the early 14th century when"], [166, "Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. ( born Leslie Lynch King Jr. ; July 14 , 1913 – December 26 , 2006 ) was an American politician who served as the 38th President of the United States from 1974 to 1977 . Prior to this he was the 40th Vice President of the United States , serving from 1973 until President Richard Nixon 's resignation in 1974 . He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment , following the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew on October 10 , 1973 . Becoming president upon Richard Nixon 's departure on August 9 , 1974 , he claimed the distinction as the first and to date the only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to either office . As he was appointed to fill a vacancy and then succeeded to the presidency , Ford also earned the distinction of being the only person in American history to neither begin nor finish either a presidential or vice presidential term on the date of a regularly-scheduled inauguration . Before ascending to the vice presidency , Ford served 25 years as Representative from Michigan 's 5th congressional district , the final 9 of them as the House Minority Leader .   As President , Ford signed the Helsinki Accords , marking a move toward détente in the Cold War . With the conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam nine months into his presidency , U.S. involvement in Vietnam essentially ended . Domestically , Ford presided over the worst economy in the four decades since the Great Depression , with growing inflation and a recession during his tenure . One of his more controversial acts was to grant a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal . During Ford 's presidency , foreign policy was characterized in procedural terms by the increased role Congress began to play , and by the corresponding curb on the powers of the President . In the GOP presidential primary campaign of 1976 , Ford defeated then-former California Governor Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination . He narrowly lost the presidential election to the Democratic challenger , then-former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter , on November 2 .   Following his years as President , Ford remained active in the Republican Party . After experiencing health problems , he died in his home on December 26 , 2006 . Ford lived longer than any other U.S. president , 93 years and 165 days , while his 895-day presidency remains the shortest term of all presidents who did not die in office . As of 2016 , he is also the most recent former president and vice president to die .   Early life   Gerald Rudolph Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. , on July 14 , 1913 , at 3202 Woolworth Avenue in Omaha , Nebraska , where his parents lived with his paternal grandparents . His mother was Dorothy Ayer Gardner , and his father was Leslie Lynch King Sr. , a wool trader and a son of prominent banker Charles Henry King and Martha Alicia King ( née Porter ) . Dorothy separated from King just sixteen days after her son 's birth . She took her son with her to the Oak Park , Illinois , home of her sister Tannisse and brother-in-law , Clarence Haskins James . From there , she moved to the home of her parents , Levi Addison Gardner and Adele Augusta Ayer , in Grand Rapids , Michigan . Dorothy and King divorced in December 1913 ; she gained full custody of her son . Ford 's paternal grandfather Charles Henry King paid child support until shortly before his death in 1930 .   Ford later said his biological father had a history of hitting his mother . James M. Cannon , a member of the Ford administration , wrote in a biography of Ford that the Kings ' separation and divorce were sparked when , a few days after Ford 's birth , Leslie King took a butcher knife and threatened to kill his wife , his infant son , and Ford 's nursemaid . Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man .   After two and a half years with her parents , on February 1 , 1916 , Dorothy married Gerald Rudolff Ford , a salesman in a family-owned paint and varnish company . They then called her son Gerald Rudolff Ford Jr . The future president was never formally adopted , and did not"], [167, "A golf course is the grounds where the game of golf is played . It comprises a series of holes , each consisting of a teeing ground , a fairway , the rough and other hazards , and a green with a flagstick ( `` pin '' ) and hole ( `` cup '' ) . A standard round of golf consists of eighteen holes . Most courses contain eighteen holes ; some share fairways or greens , and a subset has nine holes , played twice per round . Par-3 courses consist of nine or eighteen holes all of which have a par of three strokes .   Many older courses are links , often coastal . Courses are private , public , and municipally owned , and typically feature a pro shop . Many private courses are found at country clubs .   Design   Although a specialty within landscape design or landscape architecture , golf course architecture is considered a separate field of study . Some golf course architects become celebrities in their own right , such as Robert Trent Jones , Jr. ; others are professional golfers of high standing and demonstrated appreciation for golf course composition , notably Jack Nicklaus . The field is partially represented by the American Society of Golf Course Architects , the European Institute of Golf Course Architects , and the Society of Australian Golf Course Architects , though many of the finest golf course architects in the world choose not to become members of any such group , as associations of architects are not government-sanctioned licensing bodies , but private groups .   While golf courses often follow the original landscape , some modification is unavoidable . This is increasingly the case as new courses are more likely to be sited on less optimal land . Bunkers and sand traps are almost always artificial , although other hazards may be natural .   The layout of a fairway follows certain traditional principles , such as the number of holes ( nine and eighteen being most common ) , their par values , and the number of holes of each par value per course . It is also preferable to arrange greens to be close to the tee box of the next playable hole , to minimize travel distance while playing a round , and to vary the mix of shorter and longer holes . Combined with the need to package all the fairways within what is frequently a compact square or rectangular plot of land , the fairways of a course tend to form an oppositional tiling pattern . In complex areas , two holes may share the same tee box , fairway , or even green . It is also common for separate tee-off points to be positioned for men , women , and amateurs , each one respectively lying closer to the green . Eighteen-hole courses are traditionally broken down into a `` front 9 '' ( holes 1-9 ) and a `` back 9 '' ( holes 10-18 ) . On older courses ( especially links courses , like the Old Course at St. Andrews ) , the holes may be laid out in one long loop , beginning and ending at the clubhouse , and thus the front 9 is referred to on the scorecard as `` out '' ( heading out away from clubhouse ) and the back 9 as `` in '' ( heading back in toward the clubhouse ) . More recent courses ( and especially inland courses ) tend to be designed with the front 9 and the back 9 each constituting a separate loop beginning and ending at the clubhouse . This is partly for the convenience of the players and the club , as then it is easier to play just a 9-hole round , if preferred , or stop at the clubhouse for a snack between the front 9 and the back 9 .   A successful design is as visually pleasing as it is playable . With golf being a form of outdoor recreation , the strong designer is an adept student of natural landscaping who understands the aesthetic cohesion of vegetation , water bodies , paths , grasses , stonework , and woodwork , among other elements .   Par   Most golf courses have only par-3 , -4 , and -5 holes , though some courses include par-6 holes . ( The Ananti CC and the Satsuki golf course in Sano , Japan are the only courses with par 7 holes . Typical distances for the various holes from standard tees are as follows .

There are now only two remaining direct railway routes between the two cities . One line , the now northern route , is fully electric and the other , the southern route , is a diesel only line . A third line has been split into one part electric and the other part diesel operation , requiring a passenger change between the two cities . The fourth route is largely abandoned east of Warrington with the remaining section mostly catering for freight trains . The remaining two direct routes are :   * The northern route from terminus station via and to either , or . This line follows the route of the original 1830 Liverpool and Manchester Railway .  * The southern route from terminus via to Manchester Piccadilly operates on lines formerly owned by the Cheshire Lines Committee .   Northern route   The northern route runs from Liverpool Lime Street station , via and , and continues to either or . The line follows George Stephenson 's original 32-mile ( 51.5 km ) Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830 , which was the world 's first inter-city passenger railway and the first to have run 'scheduled ' services . Many early steam locomotives were initially used on this line including Stephenson 's Rocket , which won the Rainhill Trials in 1829 ( see List of Liverpool and Manchester Railway locomotives ) . The line also includes a number of listed structures including stations and bridges , particularly the Rainhill Skew Bridge and the nine-arch Sankey Viaduct .   Current services   Following completion of electrification in May 2015 , services to and Manchester Victoria are now usually operated by Class 319 4-Car Electric Multiple Units ( EMUs ) .   An hourly semi-fast service is operated by Northern , from to , usually calling at , , , and , and continuing to Manchester Airport .   Northern also operates an hourly service calling at all stations along the line between Liverpool Lime Street and .  This 'stopping service ' is supplemented by an additional all-stations service between Liverpool Lime Street and , which continues along the West Coast Main Line to .   Between Earlestown and Manchester Piccadilly , there are additional hourly services operated by Arriva Trains Wales , which originate from via the North Wales Coast Line and .   On Sundays there is one train per hour along the line , calling at all stations to Manchester Piccadilly except and . It is operated by Northern and continues to Manchester Airport .   Northern is the dominant operator on the route , and its services are operated with Class 319 4-Car EMUs or Class 150 , Class 156 and Class 142 Diesel Multiple Units ( DMUs ) . Arriva Trains Wales services between Earlestown and Manchester Piccadilly are usually operated by Class 175 DMUs , but Class 158 units may be substituted on occasions .   From the May 2014 timetable change , a new hourly First TransPennine Express service from Newcastle Central to Liverpool Lime Street via York , Leeds , Huddersfield and Manchester Victoria was introduced . This service is operated by Class 185 DMUs and runs non-stop between Manchester Victoria and Liverpool Lime Street ( 32 minutes ) .   The northern Liverpool to Manchester route is also used by First TransPennine Express and East Midlands Trains for empty coaching stock ( ECS ) movements , and as a diversionary route when the southern route is closed .   In past years , the line has been used by many express services which included through trains to , and Newcastle ( via ) , and to , and Edinburgh ( diverging on to the West Coast Main Line at Newton-le-Willows ) . Local trains also ran to Manchester via Leigh , but these services ceased in 1969 when the Eccles-Tyldesley-Leigh-Kenyon branch was closed as a result of the Beeching Axe . The northern Liverpool to Manchester line has also seen regular use over the years for diverted services from the West Coast Main Line when parts of the latter have been closed for engineering work , but diversions via Manchester instead have now become more common as they do not involve the train reversing , as would be necessary at Edge Hill , following the electrification of the route .

It was written by executive producer and lead writer Russell T Davies and directed by Dan Zeff .   The series typically follows alien time traveller the Doctor ( in his tenth incarnation , played by David Tennant ) and his companion ( s ) ( at this time Rose Tyler , played by Billie Piper ) , who travel around time and space in a machine called the TARDIS . However , `` Love & Monsters '' follows a contemporary ordinary man named Elton Pope ( Marc Warren ) who becomes obsessed with a man called the Doctor and his strange blue box , and joins a group of like-minded people in hopes of finding him . But when the mysterious Victor Kennedy ( Peter Kay ) joins the group , the fun stops and Elton discovers a darker side to his interests . Kennedy ultimately turns out to be a creature called the Abzorbaloff .   Due to the addition of a Christmas special in the production schedule , an episode had to be `` double banked '' with another story ( in this case `` The Impossible Planet '' and `` The Satan Pit '' ) for production to finish on time . With `` Love & Monsters '' , Davies was able to tell a story from a different character 's point of view to allow for only a small appearance by Tennant and Piper . The `` Doctor-lite '' and `` companion-lite '' structure has since continued in the programme . The Abzorbaloff was also incorporated into the episode by necessity , as it was the winner of a Blue Peter children 's competition to design a Doctor Who monster . `` Love & Monsters '' was watched by 6.66 million viewers in the United Kingdom and was met with divisive reception by critics and fans . Some praised the complexities of the script , while others felt it was a parody or strayed into offensive humour . Kay and the Abzorbaloff also attracted divided opinions .   Plot   The episode is presented as an excerpt from the video diary of Elton Pope ( Marc Warren ) , a young man who is describing his encounters with the Doctor . Elton 's on-camera narration forms a present-day frame story to a series of flashbacks related to the Doctor . Elton recalls a chance meeting with the Doctor and remembers having seen the same man as a child in his living room one night . On the internet he discovers others , including Ursula Blake ( Shirley Henderson ) , who have also reported similar experiences with the Doctor . Elton and Ursula form a group known as LINDA , the `` London Investigation 'N ' Detective Agency '' . They are joined by three other people : Bridget ( Moya Brady ) , Bliss ( Kathryn Drysdale ) , and Mr Skinner ( Simon Greenall ) . LINDA meets in a library basement to discuss their experiences , but soon their meetings become more social in nature .   One day a man by the name of Victor Kennedy ( Peter Kay ) interrupts a meeting and points out that LINDA has lost focus . He reinvigorates the group 's efforts to locate the Doctor by teaching them spying techniques . Elton is given the task of getting close to Rose Tyler 's mother Jackie ( Camille Coduri ) . He manages to meet Jackie at a laundrette and is invited to her apartment . She tries and fails to seduce him , but when she finds a picture of Rose in Elton 's jacket she demands that he leave her alone . Meanwhile , Bridget and Bliss disappear from the group unexpectedly . Victor explains their absence by saying that they quit to move on with their lives . After a meeting Elton , Ursula and Mr Skinner stage a walkout . Victor persuades Mr Skinner to remain behind , but Elton and Ursula leave . Ursula realises she forgot her phone , and she returns with Elton only to discover that Victor is an alien being known as the Abzorbaloff . They see the faces of the former LINDA members and other victims protruding from Victor 's body . Victor manages to absorb Ursula , but Elton gets away from him .   Victor chases Elton into a dead end alley . Before the Abzorbaloff can touch him , the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose step out .

There are strict and detailed requirements in Sunni fiqh for a place of worship to be considered a masjid  , with places that do not meet these requirements regarded as musallas . There are stringent restrictions on the uses of the area formally demarcated as the mosque ( which is often a small portion of the larger complex ) , and , in the Islamic Sharia law , after an area is formally designated as a mosque , it remains so until the Last Day .   Many mosques have elaborate domes , minarets , and prayer halls , in varying styles of architecture . Mosques originated on the Arabian Peninsula , but are now found in all inhabited continents . The mosque serves as a place where Muslims can come together for salat ( ṣalāt , meaning `` prayer '' ) as well as a center for information , education , social welfare , and dispute settlement . The imam leads the congregation in prayer .   Etymology   The word entered English from a French word that probably derived from Italian moschea , a variant of Italian moscheta , from either Middle Armenian մզկիթ ( mzkit ‘ ) or Medieval Greek μασγίδιον ( masgídion ) or Spanish mezquita , from the Arabic masjid meaning `` place of worship '' or `` prostration in prayer '' , either from Nabataean masgĕdhā́ or from Arabic sajada meaning `` to bow down in prayer '' , probably ultimately from Aramaic sĕghēdh.For the word 's origin from French and probable origin from Italian moscheta , see `` mosque , n.

History   The first mosque in the world is often considered to be the area around the Kaaba in Mecca now known as the Masjid al-Haram . Since as early as 638 AD , the Masjid al-Haram has been expanded on several occasions to accommodate the increasing number of Muslims who either live in the area or make the annual pilgrimage known as hajj to the city . Others regard the first mosque in history to be the Quba Mosque in present-day Medina since it was the first structure built by Muhammad upon his emigration from Mecca in 622 .   The Islamic Prophet Muhammad went on to establish another mosque in Medina , which is now known as the Masjid an-Nabawi , or the Prophet 's Mosque . Built on the site of his home , Muhammad participated in the construction of the mosque himself and helped pioneer the concept of the mosque as the focal point of the Islamic city . The Masjid al-Nabawi introduced some of the features still common in today 's mosques , including the niche at the front of the prayer space known as the mihrab and the tiered pulpit called the minbar . The Masjid al-Nabawi was also constructed with a large courtyard , a motif common among mosques built since then .   Diffusion and evolution   Mosques had been built in Iraq and North Africa by the end of the 7th century , as Islam spread outside the Arabian Peninsula with early caliphates . The Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala is reportedly one of the oldest mosques in Iraq , although its present form - typical of Persian architecture - only goes back to the 11th century . The shrine , while still operating as a mosque , remains one of the holiest sites for Shia Muslims , as it honors the death of the third Shia imam , and Prophet Muhammad 's grandson , Hussein ibn Ali . The Mosque of Amr ibn al-As was reportedly the first mosque in Egypt , serving as a religious and social center for Fustat ( present-day Cairo ) during its prime . Like the Imam Husayn Shrine , though , nothing of"], [171, "Benin ( or ; ) , officially the Republic of Benin ( ) and formerly Dahomey , is a country in West Africa . It is bordered by Togo to the west , Nigeria to the east , and Burkina Faso and Niger to the north . A majority of the population live on its small southern coastline on the Bight of Benin , part of the Gulf of Guinea in the northernmost tropical portion of the Atlantic Ocean . The capital of Benin is Porto-Novo , but the seat of government is in Cotonou , the country 's largest city and economic capital . Benin covers an area of 114,763 square kilometers and its population in 2015 was estimated to be approximately 10.88 million . Benin is a tropical , sub-Saharan nation , highly dependent on agriculture , with substantial employment and income arising from subsistence farming .   The official language of Benin is French . However , indigenous languages such as Fon and Yoruba are commonly spoken . The largest religious group in Benin is Roman Catholicism , followed closely by Islam , Vodun and Protestantism . Benin is a member of the United Nations , the African Union , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone , La Francophonie , the Community of Sahel-Saharan States , the African Petroleum Producers Association and the Niger Basin Authority .   From the 17th to the 19th century , the main political entities in the area were the Kingdom of Dahomey along with the city-state of Porto-Novo and a large area with many different tribes to the north . This region was referred to as the Slave Coast from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of slaves shipped to the New World during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade . After slavery was abolished , France took over the country and renamed it French Dahomey . In 1960 , Dahomey gained full independence from France , and had a tumultuous period with many different democratic governments , many military coups and military governments .   A Marxist–Leninist state called the People 's Republic of Benin existed between 1975 and 1990 . In 1991 , it was replaced by the current multi-party Republic of Benin .   Etymology   During the colonial period and at independence , the country was known as Dahomey . On 30 November 1975 it was renamed to Benin , after the body of water on which the country lies—the Bight of Benin—which , in turn , had been named after the Benin Empire ( nowadays Nigeria ) . The country of Benin has no connection to Benin City in modern Nigeria , nor to the Benin bronzes .   The new name , Benin , was chosen for its neutrality . Dahomey was the name of the former Kingdom of Dahomey , which covered only most of the southern third of the present country and therefore did not represent Porto-Novo ( a rival state in the south ) , the northwestern sector Atakora , nor the kingdom of Borgu , which covered the northeastern third .   History   Precolonial history   The current country of Benin combines three areas which had different political and ethnic systems prior to French colonial control . Before 1700 , there were a few important city states along the coast ( primarily of the Aja ethnic group , but also including Yoruba and Gbe peoples ) and a mass of tribal regions inland ( composed of Bariba , Mahi , Gedevi , and Kabye peoples ) . The Oyo Empire , located primarily to the east of modern Benin , was the most significant large-scale military force in the region and it would regularly conduct raids and exact tribute from the coastal kingdoms and the tribal regions . The situation changed in the 1600s and early 1700s as the Kingdom of Dahomey , which was of Fon ethnicity , was founded on the Abomey plateau and began taking over areas along the coast . By 1727 , king Agaja of the Kingdom of Dahomey had conquered the coastal cities of Allada and Whydah , but it had become a tributary of the Oyo empire and did not directly attack the Oyo allied city-state of Porto-Novo . The rise of the kingdom of Dahomey , the rivalry between the kingdom and the city of Porto-Novo , and the continued tribal politics of the northern region , persisted into the colonial and post-colonial periods .   The Dahomey Kingdom was known for its culture and traditions . Young boys were often apprenticed to older soldiers , and taught the kingdom 's military"], [172, "Ketchum is a city in Blaine County , Idaho , United States , in the central part of the state . The population was 2,689 at the 2010 census , down from 3,003 in 2000 . Located in the Wood River Valley , Ketchum is adjacent to Sun Valley and the communities share many resources ; both sit in the same valley beneath Bald Mountain , with its world-famous skiing . The city also draws tourists from around the world to enjoy its fishing , hiking , trail riding , tennis , shopping , art galleries , and more . The airport for Ketchum , Friedman Memorial Airport , is approximately 15 mi south in Hailey .   History   Originally the smelting center of the Warm Springs mining district , the town was first named Leadville in 1880 . The postal department decided that was too common and renamed it for David Ketchum , a local trapper and guide who had staked a claim in the basin a year earlier . Smelters were built in the 1880s , with the Philadelphia Smelter , located on Warm Springs Road , processing large amounts of lead and silver for about a decade .   After the mining boom subsided in the 1890s , sheepmen from the south drove their herds north through Ketchum in the summer , to graze in the upper elevation areas of the Pioneer , Boulder , and Sawtooth mountains . By 1920 , Ketchum had become the largest sheep-shipping center in the West . In the fall , massive herds of sheep flowed south into the town 's livestock corrals at the Union Pacific Railroad 's railhead , which connected to the main line at Shoshone .   After the development of Sun Valley by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1936 , Ketchum became popular with celebrities , including Gary Cooper and Ernest Hemingway . Hemingway loved the surrounding area ; he fished , hunted , and in the late 1950s bought a home overlooking the Wood River in nearby Warm Springs . It was there he committed suicide ; he and his granddaughter , model and actress Margaux Hemingway , are buried in the Ketchum Cemetery .   Every Labor Day weekend , Ketchum hosts the Wagon Days festival , a themed carnival featuring Old West wagon trains , narrow ore wagons , a parade , and simulated street gunfights .   Geography   Ketchum is located at an elevation of 5853 ft above sea level .   According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of , of which , is land and is water . However , two mountain streams , Trail Creek and Warm Springs Creek , join the Big Wood River in Ketchum .

K. Rowling . The novels chronicle the life of a young wizard , Harry Potter , and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley , all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . The main story arc concerns Harry 's struggle against Lord Voldemort , a dark wizard who intends to become immortal , overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic , and subjugate all wizards and non-magical people ( Muggles ) .   Since the release of the first novel , Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , on 30 June 1997 , the books have found immense popularity , critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide . They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers , and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature . The series has also had its share of criticism , including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed , as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts . , the books have sold more than 450 million copies worldwide , making them the best-selling book series in history , and have been translated into seventy-three languages . The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history , with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release .   The series was originally published in English by two major publishers , Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the United States . A play , Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , based on a story by Rowling , premiered in London on 30 July 2016 at the Palace Theatre , and its script was published by Little , Brown as the eighth book in the series . The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part film series by Warner Bros. Pictures , which has become the second highest-grossing film series of all time . The franchise has also generated much tie-in merchandise , making the Harry Potter brand worth in excess of $ 15 billion .   A series of many genres , including fantasy , drama , coming of age and the British school story ( which includes elements of mystery , thriller , adventure , horror and romance ) , the world of Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references . According to Rowling , the main theme is death . Other major themes in the series include prejudice , corruption , and madness .   The success of the books and films has ensured that the Harry Potter franchise continues to expand , with numerous derivative works , a travelling exhibition that premièred in Chicago in 2009 , a studio tour in London that opened in 2012 , a digital platform on which J.K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight , and a trilogy of spin-off films premièring in November 2016 , among many other developments .

Plot   The central character in the series is Harry Potter , an English orphan who discovers , at the age of eleven , that he is a wizard , though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles . The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world , albeit hidden and in secrecy . His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world . Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place . As Harry develops through his adolescence , he learns to overcome the problems that face him : magical , social and emotional , including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships , infatuation , romantic relationships , schoolwork and exams , anxiety , depression , stress , and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation , that lies ahead , in wizarding Britain 's increasingly-violent second wizarding war .

Not much is known about Lawrence Sheriff 's early life , but it thought that he was born near St. Andrew 's Church in Rugby , Warwickshire . ( Another theory places the location as an extant house in the nearby village of Brownsover . ) Sheriff was apprenticed by his father to a London grocer named William Walcott , at which point he went to London . His apprenticeship ended in 1541 , and he became a London grocer during the reign of King Henry VIII . In 1554 he was elected to the 'Worshipful Company of Grocers ' .   Sheriff became grocer to many of the great and good of the day including Princess ( later Queen ) Elizabeth . He became trusted by the Queen and rose to the rank of gentleman , whereupon he was granted a coat of arms , the main feature of which is a griffin , the traditional guardian of treasures . He bought extensive property near London and in the area of Rugby and Brownsover .   He earned a great fortune through his life , but remained childless , and upon his death in 1567 , he stipulated in his will that his fortune should be used to found almshouses and a school `` to serve chiefly for the children of Rugby and Brownsover ... and next for such as be of other places hereunto adjoyneing .

The United Kingdom fought the South African Republic ( Transvaal Republic ) and the Orange Free State . The British war effort was supported by troops from several regions of the British Empire , including Southern Africa , the Australian colonies , Canada , Newfoundland , British India , and New Zealand . The war ended in victory for the British and the annexation of both republics . Both would eventually be incorporated into the Union of South Africa in 1910 .   Name   The conflict is commonly referred to as simply the Boer War , since the First Boer War ( December 1880 to March 1881 ) is much less well known . `` Boer '' was the common term for Afrikaans-speaking settlers in southern Africa at the time . It is also known as the South African War outside South Africa and as the ( Second ) Anglo-Boer War among South Africans . In Afrikaans it may be called the Anglo-Boereoorlog ( `` Anglo-Boer War '' ) , Tweede Boereoorlog ( `` Second Boer War '' ) , Tweede Vryheidsoorlog ( `` Second Freedom War '' , i.e. , a war of liberation ) or Engelse oorlog ( `` English War '' ) . In South Africa it is officially called the South African War .   Origins   The complex origins of the war resulted from more than a century of conflict between the Boers and the British Empire , but of particular immediate importance was the question as to which nation would control and benefit most from the very lucrative Witwatersrand gold mines . During the Napoleonic Wars , a British military expedition landed in the Cape Colony and defeated the defending Dutch forces at the Battle of Blaauwberg ( 1806 ) . After the war , the British formally acquired the colony ( 1814 ) , and encouraged immigration by British settlers who were largely at odds with the Dutch settlers . Many Boers who were dissatisfied with aspects of British administration , in particular with Britain 's abolition of slavery on 1 December 1834 , elected to migrate away from British rule in what became known as the Great Trek .   The Trekkers initially followed the eastern coast towards Natal and then , after Britain annexed the Natal in 1843 , journeyed northwards towards the interior . There they established two independent Boer republics : the South African Republic ( 1852 ; also known as the Transvaal Republic ) and the Orange Free State ( 1854 ) . The British recognised the two Boer republics in 1852 and 1854 , but attempted British annexation of the Transvaal in 1877 led to the First Boer War in 1880–81 . After the British suffered defeats , particularly at the Battle of Majuba Hill ( 1881 ) , the independence of the two republics was restored subject to certain conditions ; relations , however , remained uneasy .   In 1866 Erasmus Jacobs discovered diamonds at Kimberley , prompting a diamond rush and a massive influx of foreigners to the borders of the Orange Free State . Then in 1886 , an Australian discovered gold in the Witwatersrand area of the South African Republic . Gold made the Transvaal the richest and potentially the most powerful nation in southern Africa ; however , the country had neither the manpower nor the industrial base to develop the resource on its own . As a result , the Transvaal reluctantly acquiesced to the immigration of uitlanders ( foreigners ) , mainly from Britain , who came to the Boer region in search of fortune and employment . This resulted in the number of uitlanders in the Transvaal potentially exceeding the number of Boers , and precipitated confrontations between the earlier-arrived Boer settlers and the newer , non-Boer arrivals .   British expansionist ideas ( notably propagated by Cecil Rhodes ) as well as disputes over uitlander political and economic rights resulted in the failed Jameson Raid of 1895 . Dr. Leander Starr Jameson , who led the raid , intended to encourage an uprising of the uitlanders in Johannesburg . However , the uitlanders did not take up arms in support , and Transvaal government forces surrounded the column and captured Jameson 's men before they could reach Johannesburg .   As tensions escalated , political manoeuvrings and negotiations attempted to reach compromise on the issues of the rights of the uitlanders within the South African Republic , control of"], [176, "Hero and Leander is the Greek myth relating the story of Hero ( , Hērṓ ; pron . like `` hero '' in English ) , a priestess of Aphrodite who dwelt in a tower in Sestos on the European side of the Hellespont ( today 's Dardanelles ) , and Leander ( , Léandros ) , a young man from Abydos on the opposite side of the strait . Leander fell in love with Hero and would swim every night across the Hellespont to be with her . Hero would light a lamp at the top of her tower to guide his way .   Succumbing to Leander 's soft words and to his argument that Aphrodite , as the goddess of love , would scorn the worship of a virgin , Hero allowed him to make love to her . These trysts lasted through the warm summer . But one stormy winter night , the waves tossed Leander in the sea and the breezes blew out Hero 's light ; Leander lost his way and was drowned . When Hero saw his dead body , she threw herself over the edge of the tower to her death to be with him .   Cultural references   The myth of Hero and Leander has been used extensively in literature and the arts :  * Ancient Roman coins of Abydos ( Troas ) : Septimius Severus ( [ http : //www.asiaminorcoins.com/gallery/displayimage.php ? pid5140 coin1 ] , [ http : //www.asiaminorcoins.com/gallery/displayimage.php ? pid  11690 coin2 ] ) Caracalla ( [ http : //www.asiaminorcoins.com/gallery/displayimage.php ? pid=5186 coin ] )  * The narrative is treated in the Double Heroides ( attributed to Ovid ) , 18 and 19 , an exchange of letters between the lovers . Leander has been unable to swim across to Hero in her tower because of bad weather ; her summons to him to make the effort will prove fatal to her lover .  * Francisco Quevedo mentions Leander in `` En crespa tempestad del oro undoso ''  * Byzantine poet Musaeus also wrote a poem ; Aldus Manutius made it one of his first publications ( c. 1493 ) after he set up his famous printing press in Venice ( his humanistic aim was to make Ancient Greek Literature available to scholars ) . Musaeus 's poem had early translations into European languages by Bernardo Tasso ( Italian ) , Boscán ( Spanish ) and Clément Marot ( French ) . This poem was widely believed in the Renaissance to have been pre-Homeric : George Chapman reflects at the end of his completion of Marlowe 's version that the dead lovers had the honour of being 'the first that ever poet sung ’ . Chapman 's 1616 translation has the title The divine poem of Musaeus . First of all bookes . Translated according to the original , by Geo : Chapman . Staplyton , the mid-17th century translator , had read Scaliger 's repudiation of this mistaken belief , but still could not resist citing Virgil 's 'Musaeum ante omnes ' ( Aeneid VI , 666 ) on the title page of his translation ( Virgil 's reference was to an earlier Musaeus ) .  * Renaissance poet Christopher Marlowe began an expansive version of the narrative . His story does not get as far as Leander 's nocturnal swim , and the guiding lamp that gets extinguished , but ends after the two have become lovers ( Hero and Leander ( poem ) ) ;  * George Chapman completed Marlowe 's poem after Marlowe 's death ; this version was often reprinted in the first half of the 17th century , with editions in 1598 ( Linley ) ; 1600 and 1606 ( Flasket ) ; 1609 , 1613 , 1617 , 1622 ( Blount ) ; 1629 ( Hawkins ) ; and 1637 ( Leake ) .  * Sir Walter Ralegh alludes to the story , in his 'The Ocean 's Love to Cynthia ' , in which Hero has fallen asleep , and fails to keep alight the lamp that guides Leander on his swim ( more kindly versions , like Chapman 's , have her desperately struggling to keep the lamp burning ) .  * Shakespeare also mentions this story in the opening scene of Two Gentlemen of Verona , in a dialogue between Valentine and Proteus ( the two gentlemen in the play ) :   VALENTINE : And on a love-book pray for my success ?

Located at the southern tip of the state of New York , the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area , one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world . With a U.S. Census Bureau-estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just 305 sqmi , New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States . A global power city , New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce , finance , media , art , fashion , research , technology , education , and entertainment , its fast pace defining the term New York minute . Home to the headquarters of the United Nations , New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world .   Situated on one of the world 's largest natural harbors , New York City consists of five boroughs , each of which is a separate county of New York State . The five boroughs – Brooklyn , Queens , Manhattan , The Bronx , and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898 . The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States , and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York , making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world . By 2015 estimates , the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States , as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area ( 20.2 million residents ) and the Combined Statistical Area ( 23.7 million residents ) . In 2013 , the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product ( GMP ) of nearly US $ 1.39 trillion , while in 2012 , the CSA generated a GMP of over US $ 1.55 trillion , both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve and eleven countries , respectively .   New York City traces its origin to its 1624 founding in Lower Manhattan as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626 . The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 . New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790 . It has been the country 's largest city since 1790 . The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a symbol of the United States and its democracy . In the 21st century , New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship , social tolerance , and environmental sustainability .   Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known , and the city received a record of nearly 60 million tourists in 2015 , hosting three of the world 's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013 . Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world . Times Square , iconic as the world 's `` heart '' and its `` Crossroads '' , is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District , one of the world 's busiest pedestrian intersections , and a major center of the world 's entertainment industry . The names of many of the city 's bridges , skyscrapers , and parks are known around the world . Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan , New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world , and the city is home to the world 's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization , the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ . Manhattan 's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world . Manhattan 's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere , with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city .

AD 60 or 61 ) was a queen of the British Celtic Iceni tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire .   Boudica 's husband Prasutagus ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome and left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the Roman emperor in his will . However , when he died his will was ignored , and the kingdom was annexed . Boudica was flogged , her daughters raped , and Roman financiers called in their loans .   In AD 60 or 61 , when the Roman governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus was campaigning on the island of Anglesey off the northwest coast of Wales , Boudica led the Iceni , the Trinovantes , and others in revolt . They destroyed ( modern Colchester ) , earlier the capital of the Trinovantes but at that time a ' , a settlement for discharged Roman soldiers and site of a temple to the former Emperor Claudius . Upon hearing of the revolt , Suetonius hurried to ( modern London ) , the 20-year-old commercial settlement that was the rebels ' next target .   The Romans , having concluded that they lacked sufficient numbers to defend the settlement , evacuated and abandoned . Boudica led 100,000 Iceni , Trinovantes , and others to fight , and burned and destroyed , and ( modern-day St Albans ) .   An estimated 70,000–80,000 Romans and British were killed in the three cities by those led by Boudica . Suetonius , meanwhile , regrouped his forces in the West Midlands , and , despite being heavily outnumbered , defeated the Britons in the Battle of Watling Street .   The crisis caused Nero to consider withdrawing all Roman forces from Britain , but Suetonius ' eventual victory over Boudica confirmed Roman control of the province . Boudica then either killed herself to avoid capture , or died of illness . The extant sources , Tacitus and Cassius Dio , differ .   Interest in these events revived in the English Renaissance and led to Boudica 's fame in the Victorian era . Boudica has remained an important cultural symbol in the United Kingdom . However , the absence of native British literature during the early part of the first millennium means that knowledge of Boudica 's rebellion comes solely from the writings of the Romans .   Name   Boudica has been known by several versions of her name . Raphael Holinshed calls her Voadicia , while Edmund Spenser calls her Bunduca , a version of the name that was used in the popular Jacobean play Bonduca , in 1612 . William Cowper 's poem , Boadicea , an ode ( 1782 ) popularised an alternative version of the name . From the 19th century and much of the late 20th century , Boadicea was the most common version of the name , which is probably derived from a mistranscription when a manuscript of Tacitus was copied in the Middle Ages .   Her name was clearly spelled Boudicca in the best manuscripts of Tacitus , but also , , and in the ( later and probably secondary ) epitome of Cassius Dio . The name is attested in inscriptions as Boudica in Lusitania , Boudiga in Bordeaux , and Bodicca in Algeria .   Kenneth Jackson concludes , based on later development of Welsh and Irish , that the name derives from the Proto-Celtic feminine adjective * boudīkā , `` victorious '' , that in turn is derived from the Celtic word * boudā , `` victory '' ( cf . Irish ' ( Classical Irish ' ) , Buaidheach , Welsh ' ) , and that the correct spelling of the name in Common Brittonic ( the British Celtic language ) is Boudica , pronounced .   The closest English equivalent to the vowel in the first syllable is the ow in `` bow-and-arrow '' . The modern English pronunciation is , and it has been suggested that the most comparable English name , in meaning only , would be `` Victoria '' .   History   Background   Tacitus and Cassius Dio agree that Boudica was of royal descent . Dio describes her as `` possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women . '' He also describes her as tall , with tawny hair hanging down to below her waist , a harsh voice and a piercing glare . He notes that she habitually wore a large golden necklace ( perhaps a torc )"], [179, "`` Whole Again '' is the fifth single released from British pop girl group Atomic Kitten 's debut album , Right Now ( 2000 ) . It is the group 's biggest selling single to date and was the final single to feature founding member Kerry Katona , who left the group mid-way through promoting the single . `` Whole Again '' was the first single released from the album in Europe , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa . It was a massive success , reaching number one in several countries , and sold 1 million copies in the UK alone . Among the song 's writers was OMD frontman and Atomic Kitten founder Andy McCluskey , who achieved his only UK number one single with the track .   Following the departure of Katona , she was replaced a few days later by Jenny Frost , just after the single reached number one in the UK . As a result , the music video was reshot and Frost 's vocals appeared on the reissue of Right Now .   Background   Following the failures of previous single `` Follow Me '' and the initial release of their debut album , Right Now , Atomic Kitten persuaded Virgin Records to release the single as a last-ditch attempt to keep their record deal . They were given a shoe-string budget for the single 's release with a basic video and previous photo shoots used for cover artwork . During promotion for the single , band member Kerry Katona announced her pregnancy and subsequent decision to leave the group . With the single 's release imminent , the group opted to recruit Jenny Frost as a replacement and continued their promotional campaign . Surprisingly the single was a massive success , beating U2 to the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart and remaining there for four consecutive weeks .   .In a rare Asian pressing of their Right Now album , the song `` Whole Again '' features all lines spoken by Katona with only the chorus sung by the girls which was taken from the Japanese version of Right Now . The original version of Right Now features Katona 's vocals ; however , the reissue of the album features new vocals by Jenny Frost . This version has since replaced Katona 's version for radio airplay , and it was subsequently issued as a bonus track on international versions of the group 's second album , Feels So Good .   The first line of the song is identical to that of `` Walk on By '' by Bacharach and David .   Music video   The music video for `` Whole Again '' was filmed on a very small budget due to the commercial failure of previous single `` Follow Me '' . It features the girls singing in front of a plain white background – similar to the video for the Sugababes ' debut single `` Overload '' . The original version of the video includes Kerry Katona , who had left the group just before the song 's release . Much of the video was subsequently reshot to feature new member Jenny Frost .   As a result of the single 's huge success in many international markets , a second music video was filmed for the U.S. release with a much larger budget . This version features the three girls walking through the streets in Downtown Los Angeles and walking out into the countryside , gradually picking up more people along the way . The video ends with the camera zooming out on the field for Atomic Kitten 's old logo is invisible in a shape of a kitten .

He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the war god Mars , and is known in Latin also as Amor ( `` Love '' ) . His Greek counterpart is Eros.Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia , The Book People , Haydock , 1995 , p. 215 .   Although Eros is in Classical Greek art as a slender winged youth , during the Hellenistic period , he was increasingly portrayed as a chubby boy . During this time , his iconography acquired the bow and arrow that represent his source of power : a person , or even a deity , who is shot by Cupid 's arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire . In myths , Cupid is a minor character who serves mostly to set the plot in motion . He is a main character only in the tale of Cupid and Psyche , when wounded by his own weapons he experiences the ordeal of love . Although other extended stories are not told about him , his tradition is rich in poetic themes and visual scenarios , such as `` Love conquers all '' and the retaliatory punishment or torture of Cupid .   In art , Cupid often appears in multiples as the Amores , or amorini in the later terminology of art history , the equivalent of the Greek erotes . Cupids are a frequent motif of both Roman art and later Western art of the classical tradition . In the 15th century , the iconography of Cupid starts to become indistinguishable from the putto .   Cupid continued to be a popular figure in the Middle Ages , when under Christian influence he often had a dual nature as Heavenly and Earthly love . In the Renaissance , a renewed interest in classical philosophy endowed him with complex allegorical meanings . In contemporary popular culture , Cupid is shown drawing his bow to inspire romantic love , often as an icon of Valentine 's Day .   Origins and birth   The Romans reinterpreted myths and concepts pertaining to the Greek Eros for Cupid in their own literature and art , and medieval and Renaissance mythographers conflate the two freely . In the Greek tradition , Eros had a dual , contradictory genealogy . He was among the primordial gods who came into existence asexually ; after his generation , deities were begotten through male-female unions . In Hesiod 's Theogony , only Chaos and Gaia ( Earth ) are older . Before the existence of gender dichotomy , Eros functioned by causing entities to separate from themselves that which they already contained .   At the same time , the Eros who was pictured as a boy or slim youth was regarded as the child of a divine couple , the identity of whom varied by source . The influential Renaissance mythographer Natale Conti began his chapter on Cupid/Eros by declaring that the Greeks themselves were unsure about his parentage : Heaven and Earth , Ares and Aphrodite , Night and Ether , or Strife and Zephyr . The Greek travel writer Pausanias , he notes , contradicts himself by saying at one point that Eros welcomed Aphrodite into the world , and at another that Eros was the son of Aphrodite and the youngest of the gods .   In Latin literature , Cupid is usually treated as the son of Venus without reference to a father . Seneca says that Vulcan , as the husband of Venus , is the father of Cupid . Cicero , however , says that there were three Cupids , as well as three Venuses : the first Cupid was the son of Mercury and Diana , the second of Mercury and the second Venus , and the third of Mars and the third Venus . This last Cupid was the equivalent of Anteros , `` Counter-Love , '' one of the Erotes , the gods who embody aspects of love . The multiple Cupids frolicking in art are the decorative manifestation of these proliferating loves and desires . During the English Renaissance , Christopher Marlowe wrote of `` ten thousand Cupids '' ; in Ben Jonson 's wedding masque Hymenaei , `` a thousand several-coloured loves ... hop about the nuptial room '' .   In the later classical tradition , Cupid is most often regarded as the son of Venus and Mars , whose love affair represented an allegory of Love and War . The duality between the primordial and the sexually conceived Eros"], [181, "Norway ( ; Norwegian : ( Bokmål ) or ( Nynorsk ) ) , officially the Kingdom of Norway , is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard . The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom . Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land . Until 1814 , the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands ( since 1035 ) , Greenland ( 1261 ) , and Iceland ( 1262 ) . It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468 .   Norway has a total area of 385252 km2 and a population of 5 213 985 ( May 2016 ) . The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden ( 1,619 km or 1,006 mi long ) . Norway is bordered by Finland and Russia to the north-east , and the Skagerrak Strait to the south , with Denmark on the other side . Norway has an extensive coastline , facing the North Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea .   King Harald V of the German House of Glücksburg is the current King of Norway . Erna Solberg became Prime Minister in 2013 , replacing Jens Stoltenberg . A constitutional monarchy , Norway divides state power between the Parliament , the Cabinet , and the Supreme Court , as determined by the 1814 Constitution . The Kingdom is established as a merger of several petty kingdoms . By the traditional count from the year 872 the Kingdom has existed continuously for 1,144 years , and the list of Norwegian monarchs includes over sixty kings and earls .   Norway has both administrative and political subdivisions on two levels : counties and municipalities . The Sámi people have a certain amount of self-determination and influence over traditional territories through the Sámi Parliament and the Finnmark Act . Norway maintains close ties with the European Union and the United States . Norway is a founding member of the United Nations , NATO , the Council of Europe , the Antarctic Treaty and the Nordic Council ; a member of the European Economic Area , the WTO and the OECD ; and is also a part of the Schengen Area .   The country maintains a combination of market economy and a Nordic welfare model with universal health care and a comprehensive social security system . Norway has extensive reserves of petroleum , natural gas , minerals , lumber , seafood , fresh water , and hydropower . The petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of the country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) . On a per-capita basis , Norway is the world 's largest producer of oil and natural gas outside the Middle East .   The country has the fourth-highest per capita income in the world on the World Bank and IMF lists . On the CIA 's GDP ( PPP ) per capita list ( 2015 estimate ) which includes territories and some regions , Norway ranks as number eleven . From 2001 to 2006 , and then again from 2009 to 2015 , Norway had the highest Human Development Index ranking in the world . Norway has topped the Legatum Prosperity Index for seven years in a row as of 2015 . Norway ranks also first on the OECD Better Life Index , the Index of Public Integrity , and the Democracy Index .   Etymology   Norway has two official names : Noreg in Nynorsk ( Old Norse : Noregr ) and Norge in Bokmål ( Old Norse : Noregi , dative of Noregr ) .   The name Norway comes from the Old Norse word norðrvegr , `` northern way '' or `` way leading to the north '' , which the Geats and the Danes named the coastline of western Norway , contrasting with suðrvegar `` southern way '' for Germany , and austrvegr `` eastern way '' for the Baltic .   Philology professor Magnus Olsen wrote that norðrvegr refers to the inner-archipelago sailing route of southwestern Norway , the home area of Harald Fairhair , the first king of Norway , and that because of him , the name was extended to the entire country . The newer interpretation of the syllable is Norvegr , where nor ( ve ) - means narrow ( ) and - ( ve ) gr ( ) means way that refers to the sailing routes through the straits of Norway . The old meaning of the word is interpreted as `` The narrow way through the"], [182, "A state of the United States of America is one of the 50 constituent political entities that shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government . Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government , Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside . State citizenship and residency are flexible , and no government approval is required to move between states , except for persons covered by certain types of court orders ( e.g. , paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody ) .   States range in population from just under 600,000 ( Wyoming ) to over 38 million ( California ) , and in area from ( Rhode Island ) to ( Alaska ) . Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names .   States are divided into counties or county-equivalents , which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign . County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state . State governments are allocated power by the people ( of each respective state ) through their individual constitutions . All are grounded in republican principles , and each provides for a government , consisting of three branches : executive , legislative , and judicial .   States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution ; among them ratifying constitutional amendments . Historically , the tasks of local law enforcement , public education , public health , regulating intrastate commerce , and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities , although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well . Over time , the U.S. Constitution has been amended , and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed . The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation , with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did . There is a continuing debate over states ' rights , which concerns the extent and nature of the states ' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals .   States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress , a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives . Each state is represented by two Senators , and at least one Representative , while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census . Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College , the body that elects the President of the United States , equal to the total of Representatives and Senators from that state .   The Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union . Since the establishment of the United States in 1776 , the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50 . Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted , both in 1959 .   The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede ( withdraw from ) from the Union . Shortly after the Civil War , the U.S. Supreme Court , in Texas v. White , held that a state can not unilaterally do so .   States of the United States   The 50 U.S. states ( in alphabetical order ) , along with state flag and date each joined the union :   Governments   As each state is itself a sovereign entity , it reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way ( within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution ) deemed appropriate by its people . As a result , while the governments of the various states share many similar features , they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance . No two state governments are identical .   Constitutions   The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution . Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart . The Constitution of Alabama , for example , contains 310,296 words — more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution . In practice , each state has adopted a three-branch system of government , modeled after the federal government , and consisting of three branches ( although the three-branch structure is not required ) : executive , legislative , and judicial .

Travelocity is based in Dallas , Texas , in the United States . lastminute.com in Europe was a sister site of Travelocity , sold to Swiss-based Bravofly Rumbo in December 2014 . In recent years , businesses and sites once owned and operated by Travelocity , including Travelocity Business , Zuji and IgoUgo , were sold or shut down as Travelocity focused on its core consumer travel business .   History   American Airlines began offering customer access to its electronic reservation system , Sabre , in 1978 to travel agencies , and in the mid-1980s on the CompuServe Information Service and GEnie to consumers under the `` eAAsySabre '' brand name . This service was extended to America Online in the 1990s . The CEO of the eAAsySabre was Kathy Misunas .   Travelocity was created in 1996 as a subsidiary of Sabre Holdings , itself a subsidiary of American Airlines , and was run by long-time Sabre information technology executive Terry Jones . As one of the pioneers of web-based disintermediation , Travelocity.com was the first website that allowed consumers themselves not only to access Sabre 's fare and schedule information , but also to reserve , book , and purchase tickets without the help of a travel agent or broker . In addition to airfares , the site also permits consumers to book hotel rooms , rental cars , cruises and packaged vacations .   Travelocity gained momentum after AOL 's travel portal became associated with the brand in 1999 . In 2000 , Sabre negotiated a merger of Travelocity with another early web travel company , Preview Travel . The resulting company was independently quoted on the NASDAQ exchange , with Sabre continuing to own around 70 percent of the combined company 's outstanding stock . In 2002 , with Travelocity 's fortunes suffering from competition including Expedia and Orbitz , Sabre consummated a tender offer for the remainder of the outstanding shares in Travelocity and remerged the business into Sabre as a subsidiary . Jones left the company shortly afterward .   Also in March 2002 , Travelocity acquired last minute travel specialist Site59.com .

With more than 2.7 million copies sold in the UK , Hopes and Fears ranked the 11th-best-selling album of the 2000s in the UK . In July 2011 , it was ranked the 9th biggest-selling album of the 21st century in the UK . Worldwide , the album had sold over 5.8 million copies as of November 2009 .   Album information   Unlike with their follow up album , most songs were already composed by the album 's conception date ; the track `` She Has No Time '' was composed circa 1999 , making it the earliest composed song appearing on the album , and the remaining were composed just after former member Dominic Scott 's departure in July 2001 . The tracks `` On a Day Like Today '' and `` We Might As Well Be Strangers '' became the last to be composed , circa 2003 .   The album was recorded at Helioscentric Studios in Peasmarsh , Rye by Andy Green and the band between September and Christmas 2003 . James Sanger did not attend any recording sessions post his involvement with the band in 2001 .   The album takes its name from the song `` Snowed Under '' , released as a B-side on the single for `` Somewhere Only We Know '' .   Hal Leonard music published two versions of the official score book for Hopes and Fears , designed for differing skill levels . The Music Sales Group also published a book , including two demo CDs with accompanying bass and drum tracks , along with scores for the B-side songs `` Snowed Under '' , `` Walnut Tree '' and `` Fly to Me '' .   The objects on the cover of Hopes and Fears are piano hammers in allusion to the band 's characteristic piano sound . The many different versions of the album can be distinguished by the colour of the artwork . The original UK version has a dark green cover , the European version a black one , the US version white ; the international version has a red-brown scheme , and the Japanese version is blue . The original British one includes the track `` On a Day Like Today '' and the tracklist order differs from the European version . The Japanese version includes `` Allemande '' .   The typeface selected for this , and for all Keane releases off the album was the font Cochin , designed originally in 1912 . The modern italic design of the letters was also followed with similar fonts by some fansites , such as former British site [ http : //www.keaneshaped.co.uk Keaneshaped ] .

'' AllMusic , giving the album three and a half out of five stars , praised its `` beautiful , emotive dalliance of instrumentation '' , singer Tom Chaplin 's `` rich vocals '' and the band 's `` open-hearted ambition ... audible on every song '' , while Rolling Stone noted that the album `` contains more hooks than most pop groups manage in their careers . ''   In a mixed 3-star review , The Guardian criticised the first half the album for `` rely [ ing ] too heavily on Chaplin 's show-stopping vocals '' and for the `` radio-friendly simplicity of the lyrics '' , while praising 'Ca n't Stop Now ' as a `` swooning"], [185, "Jack Daniel 's is a brand of Tennessee whiskey and the top selling American whiskey in the world .

Jack was one of 13 children fathered by Calaway Daniel and was the youngest of his mother 's 10 children . After Daniel 's mother , Lucinda Cook Daniel , died , his father remarried and had several more children .

He was of Welsh , Scottish , English , and Scots-Irish descent . Daniel 's father died in the Civil War , and he despised his step-mother , and as a result he ran away from home and was essentially orphaned at a young age .   Daniel was taken in by a local lay preacher and moonshine distiller named Dan Call and began learning the distilling trade as a teenager from Call and Call 's Master Distiller Nearis , sometimes spelled Nearest , Green , an enslaved African American man , who continued to work with Call after emancipation . In 1875 , on receiving an inheritance from his father 's estate ( following a long dispute with his siblings ) , Daniel founded a legally registered distilling business with Call . He took over the distillery shortly afterward when Call quit for religious reasons . The brand label on the product says `` Est . & Reg . in 1866 '' , but his biographer has cited official registration documents to assert that the business was not established until 1875 .

Directed by James Frawley and produced by Jim Henson , the film 's screenplay was written by The Muppet Show writers Jerry Juhl and Jack Burns .   An American and British venture produced by Henson Associates and ITC Entertainment between the third and fourth seasons of The Muppet Show , the film depicts Kermit the Frog as he embarks on a cross-country trip to Hollywood , California . Along the way , he encounters several of the Muppets—who all share the same ambition of finding success in professional show business—while being pursued by Doc Hopper , a relentless restaurateur with intentions of employing Kermit as a spokesperson for his frog legs business .   Notable for its surreal humour , meta-references and prolific use of cameos , The Muppet Movie was released in the United Kingdom on May 31 , 1979 and in the United States on June 22 , 1979 , and received critical praise ; including two Academy Award nominations for Paul Williams and Kenneth Ascher 's musical score and their song , `` Rainbow Connection '' .

Designed to run on Linux and other Unix-like computer operating systems , its name is a recursive acronym for Gambas Almost Means Basic . Gambas is also the word for prawns in the Spanish and Portuguese language , from which the project 's logos are derived .   History   Gambas was developed by the French programmer Benoît Minisini with its first release coming in 1999 . Benoît had grown up with the BASIC language , and decided to make a free software development environment that could quickly and easily make programs with user interfaces .   The Gambas 1.x versions featured an interface made up of several different separate windows for forms and IDE dialogues in a similar fashion to the interface of the GIMP . It could also only develop applications using Qt and was more oriented towards the development of applications for KDE . The last release of the 1.x versions was Gambas 1.0.19 .   The first of the 2.x versions was released on January 2 , 2008 after three to four years of development . It featured a major redesign of the interface , now with all forms and functions embedded in a single window , as well as some changes to the Gambas syntax , although for the most part code compatibility was kept . It featured major updates to existing Gambas components as well as the addition of some new ones , such as new components that could use GTK+ or SDL for drawing or utilize OpenGL acceleration . Gambas 2.x versions can load up and run Gambas 1.x projects , with occasional incompatibilities .   The next major iteration of Gambas , the 3.x versions , was released on December 31 , 2011 . Early benchmarks of the Gambas 3 development versions showed its Gambas scripting being significantly faster than Perl and Python equivalents .   Features   Gambas is designed to build graphical applications programs using the Qt ( currently QT 4.x ) or the GTK+ toolkit ( GTK 3.x also supported as of 3.6.0 ) ; the Gambas IDE is written in Gambas itself . Gambas includes a GUI designer to aid in creating user interfaces , but can also make command line applications . The Gambas runtime environment is needed to run executables .   Functionality is provided by a variety of components , each of which can be selected to provide additional features . Drawing can be provided either through Qt and GTK+ toolkits , with an additional component which is designed to switch between them . Drawing can also be provided through the Simple DirectMedia Layer ( currently version 1.x , with 2.x support in the works ) , which can also be utilized for audio playback through a separate sound component ( a component for the OpenAL specification has also been added ) . GPU acceleration support is available through an OpenGL component , as well as other hardware functionally provided by various other components . There are also components for handling other specialized tasks .   With Gambas , developers can also use databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL , build KDE ( Qt ) and GNOME GTK+ applications with DCOP , translate Visual Basic programs to Gambas and run them under Linux , build network solutions , and create CGI web applications . The IDE also includes a tool for the creation of installation packages , supporting GNU Autotools , slackpkg , pacman , RPM , and debs ( the latter two then tailored for specific distributions such as Fedora/RHEL/CentOS , Mageia , Mandriva , OpenSUSE and Debian , Ubuntu/Mint ) .   Gambas since version 3.2 IDE has integrated profiler and it started to use Just-in-time compilation technology .   Differences from Visual Basic   Gambas is intended to provide a similar experience as developing in Microsoft Visual Basic , but it is not a free software clone of the popular proprietary program . The author of Gambas makes it clear that there are similarities to Visual Basic , such as syntax for BASIC programs and the integrated development environment ; Gambas was written from the start to be a development environment of its own and seeks to improve on the formula .   Its object model and each class being represented in a file , the archiver to package the program is inspired by the Java programming language . Gambas is intended to be an alternative for former Visual Basic developers who have decided to migrate to Linux .

A cover version in 1977 by Jamaican singer Grace Jones was also a successful international hit . `` La Vie en rose '' has been covered by several artists over the years , including a 1950 version by Louis Armstrong and a 1993 version by American singer Donna Summer . Harry James recorded a version in 1950 on Columbia 38768 .   Édith Piaf version   Background and release   The song 's title can be translated as `` Life in Rosy Hues '' or `` Life Through Rose-Tinted Glasses '' ; its literal meaning is `` Life in Pink '' .   The lyrics and melody of the song were written by Édith Piaf herself , but the melody was said officially to have been composed and registered by Louiguy only , since at the time , due to the stringent registration requirements of SACEM , Piaf did not have the necessary qualifications to be able to copyright her work with SACEM . Piaf offered the song to Marianne Michel , who slightly modified the lyrics , changing `` les choses '' ( `` things '' ) for `` la vie '' ( `` life '' ) . In 1943 , Piaf had performed at a nightclub/bordello called `` La Vie en Rose '' . Initially , Piaf 's peers and songwriting team did not think the song would be successful , finding it weaker than the rest of her repertoire . Heeding their advice , the singer put the song aside , only to change her mind the next year . The song was performed live in concert for the first time in 1946 . It became a favorite with audiences . `` La Vie en rose '' was the song that made Piaf internationally famous , with its lyrics telling about the joy of finding true love and appealing to those who had survived the difficult wartime .   `` La Vie en rose '' was released on a 10 '' single in 1947 by Columbia Records , a division of EMI , with `` Un refrain courait dans la rue '' making the B-side . It met with a warm reception and sold a million copies in the USA . It was the biggest-selling single of 1948 in Italy , and the ninth biggest-selling single in Brazil in 1949 . Piaf performed the song in the 1948 French movie Neuf garçons , un coeur . The first of her albums to include `` La Vie en rose '' was the 10 '' Chansons parisiennes , released in 1950 . The song appeared on most of Piaf 's subsequent albums , and on numerous greatest hits compilations . It went on to become her signature song and her trademark hit , sitting with `` Milord '' and `` Non , je ne regrette rien '' among her best-known and most recognizable tunes . Encouraged by its success , Piaf wrote 80 more songs in her career .   June 26 , 1950 , Louis Armstrong record C'est si bon and La Vie en rose in New York with Sy Oliver and his Orchestra .

Run by the Government Code and Cypher School ( GC & CS ) , it regularly penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powersmost importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers . The official historian of World War II British Intelligence has written that the `` Ultra '' intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years , and that without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain .   Located in Milton Keynes , Buckinghamshire , England , Bletchley Park is now a flourishing heritage attraction . Open seven days a week , it is popular with individuals and families , as well as school groups and tour parties .   Site   Bletchley Park is opposite Bletchley railway station . It is close to junctions 13 and 14 of the M1 . Located 50 mi northwest of London , the site appears in the Domesday Book as part of the Manor of Eaton . Browne Willis built a mansion there in 1711 , but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down . It was first known as Bletchley Park after its purchase by Samuel Lipscomb Seckham in 1877 . The estate of 581 acres was bought in 1883 by Sir Herbert Samuel Leon , who expanded the then-existing farmhouse into the present `` maudlin and monstrous pile '' combining Victorian Gothic , Tudor , and Dutch Baroque styles .   In 1938 , the mansion and much of the site was bought by a builder planning a housing estate , but in May 1938 Admiral Sir Hugh Sinclair , head of the Secret Intelligence Service ( SIS or MI6 ) , bought the mansion and 58 acre for use by GC & CS and SIS in the event of war .   A key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues ( inspecting the site under the cover of `` Captain Ridley 's shooting party '' ) was Bletchley 's geographical centrality . It was almost immediately adjacent to Bletchley railway station , where the `` Varsity Line '' between Oxford and Cambridgewhose universities were expected to supply many of the code-breakersmet the main West Coast railway line connecting London , Birmingham , Manchester , Liverpool , Glasgow and Edinburgh . Watling Street , the main road linking London to the north-west ( now the A5 ) was close by , and high-volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby Fenny Stratford .   Bletchley Park was known as `` B.P . '' to those who worked there .  `` Station X '' ( X = Roman numeral ten ) , `` London Signals Intelligence Centre '' , and `` Government Communications Headquarters '' were all cover names used during the war .  ( The formal posting of the many `` Wrens '' members of the Women 's Royal Naval Serviceworking there was to HMS Pembroke V . )   Personnel   In January 1945 , at the peak of codebreaking efforts , some 10,000 personnel were working at Bletchley and its outstations . A substantial percentage of personnel at Bletchley Park , 75 % , were women ; among them were Mavis Batey and Margaret Rock , who were credited for the Abwehr break . Their work achieved official recognition only in 2009 . Many of the women came from middle-class backgrounds and held degrees in the areas of mathematics , physics and engineering ; they were given entry into STEM programs due to the lack of men , who had been sent to war . They performed complex calculation and coding and hence were integral to the computing processes —Jennifer S. Light writes that they Women were indeed the first computers .   Commander Alastair Denniston was operational head of GC & CS from 1919 to 1942 , beginning with its formation from the Admiralty 's Room 40 ( NID25 ) and the War Office 's MI1b . Key GC & CS cryptanalysts who moved from London to Bletchley Park included John Tiltman , Dillwyn `` Dilly '' Knox , Josh Cooper , and Nigel de Grey . These people had a variety of backgroundslinguists , chess champions , and crossword experts were common , and in Knox 's case papyrology . The British War Office recruited top solvers of cryptic crossword puzzles , as these individuals had strong lateral thinking skills .   On the day Britain declared war on Germany , Denniston wrote to the Foreign Office about recruiting `` men of the professor type '' .

The novel was originally serialized from March 1869 through June 1870 in Pierre-Jules Hetzel 's periodical , the Magasin d ’ Éducation et de Récréation . The deluxe illustrated edition , published by Hetzel in November 1871 , included 111 illustrations by Alphonse de Neuville and Édouard Riou . The book was highly acclaimed when released and still is now ; it is regarded as one of the premiere adventure novels and one of Verne 's greatest works , along with Around the World in Eighty Days and Journey to the Center of the Earth . The description of Nemo 's ship , called the Nautilus , was considered ahead of its time , as it accurately describes features on submarines , which at the time were very primitive vessels . Thus , the book has been able to age well because of its scientific theories , unlike some of Verne 's other works , like Journey to the Center of the Earth , which are not scientifically accurate and serve more simply as adventure novels .   Title   The title refers to the distance traveled while under the sea and not to a depth , as 20,000 leagues is over six times the diameter , and nearly three times the circumference of the Earth . The greatest depth mentioned in the book is four leagues . ( The book uses metric leagues , which are four kilometres each . ) A literal translation of the French title would end in the plural `` seas '' , thus implying the `` seven seas '' through which the characters of the novel travel ; however , the early English translations of the title used `` sea '' , meaning the ocean in general .   Plot   During the year 1866 , ships of several nations spot a mysterious sea monster , which some suggest to be a giant narwhal . The United States government assembles an expedition in New York City to find and destroy the monster . Professor Pierre Aronnax , a French marine biologist and narrator of the story , who happens to be in New York at the time , receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition which he accepts . Canadian whaler and master harpoonist Ned Land and Aronnax 's faithful servant Conseil are also brought aboard .   The expedition departs Brooklyn aboard the United States Navy frigate Abraham Lincoln and travels south around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean . The ship finds the monster after a long search and then attacks the beast , which damages the ship 's rudder . The three protagonists are then hurled into the water and grasp hold of the `` hide '' of the creature , which they find , to their surprise , to be a submarine very far ahead of its era . They are quickly captured and brought inside the vessel , where they meet its enigmatic creator and commander , Captain Nemo .   The rest of the story follows the adventures of the protagonists aboard the creature—the submarine , the Nautilus—which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas free from any land-based government . Captain Nemo 's motivation is implied to be both a scientific thirst for knowledge and a desire for revenge on ( and self-imposed exile from ) civilization . Nemo explains that his submarine is electrically powered and can perform advanced marine biology research ; he also tells his new passengers that although he appreciates conversing with such an expert as Aronnax , maintaining the secrecy of his existence requires never letting them leave . Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the undersea adventures , but Ned Land can only think of escape .   They visit many places under the oceans , some real-life places , others completely fictional . Thus , the travelers witness the real corals of the Red Sea , the wrecks of the battle of Vigo Bay , the Antarctic ice shelves , the Transatlantic telegraph cable and the fictional submerged land of Atlantis . The travelers also use diving suits to hunt sharks and other marine life with air-guns and have an underwater funeral for a crew member who died when an accident occurred under mysterious—and unknown to the reader—conditions inside the Nautilus . When the Nautilus returns to the Atlantic Ocean , a pack of `` poulpes '' ( usually translated as a giant squid , although in French `` poulpe"], [191, "Mel Colmcille Gerard Gibson ( born January 3 , 1956 ) is an American actor and filmmaker ( screenwriter , producer , and director ) . Gibson was born in Peekskill , New York , and moved with his parents to Sydney , Australia , when he was 12 years old .   Gibson is most well known as an action hero , for roles such as Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon buddy cop film series , and Max Rockatansky in the first three films in the Mad Max post-apocalyptic action series .   Gibson studied acting at the Australian National Institute of Dramatic Art . During the 1980s , Gibson founded Icon Entertainment , a production company which independent film director Atom Egoyan has called , `` an alternative to the studio system . '' Director Peter Weir cast Gibson as one of the leads in the critically acclaimed World War I drama Gallipoli ( 1981 ) , which earned Gibson a Best Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute . The film also helped to earn Gibson the reputation of a serious , versatile actor .   In 1995 , Gibson produced , directed , and starred in the epic historical drama film Braveheart , for which he won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Director , along with the Academy Award for Best Picture . In 2004 , Gibson directed and produced the financially successful and controversial , biblical drama film The Passion of the Christ . Gibson received further critical notice for his directorial work of the 2006 action-adventure film Apocalypto , which is set in Mesoamerica during the early 16th century .   Early life   Gibson was born in Peekskill , New York , the sixth of eleven children , and the second son of Hutton Gibson , a writer , and Irish-born Anne Patricia ( née Reilly , died 1990 ) . Gibson 's paternal grandmother was opera contralto Eva Mylott ( 1875–1920 ) , who was born in Australia , to Irish parents , while his paternal grandfather , John Hutton Gibson , was a millionaire tobacco businessman from the American South . One of Gibson 's younger brothers , Donal , is also an actor . Gibson 's first name is derived from Saint Mel , fifth-century Irish saint , and founder of Gibson 's mother 's native diocese , Ardagh , while his second name , Colmcille , is also shared by an Irish saint and is the name of the Aughnacliffe parish in County Longford where Gibson 's mother was born and raised . Because of his mother and his father 's mother who immigrated to Australia from Ireland , Gibson retains dual Irish and American citizenship .   Gibson 's father was awarded US $ 145,000 in a work-related-injury lawsuit against the New York Central Railroad on February 14 , 1968 , and soon afterwards relocated his family to West Pymble , Sydney , Australia . Mel Gibson was 12 years old at the time . The move to his grandmother 's native Australia was for economic reasons , and his father 's expectation that the Australian Defence Forces would reject his eldest son for the draft during the Vietnam War .   Gibson was educated by members of the Congregation of Christian Brothers at St Leo 's Catholic College in Wahroonga , New South Wales , during his high school years .   Career   Overview   Gibson gained very favorable notices from film critics when he first entered the cinematic scene , as well as comparisons to several classic movie stars . In 1982 , Vincent Canby wrote that `` Mr. Gibson recalls the young Steve McQueen ... I ca n't define `` star quality , '' but whatever it is , Mr. Gibson has it . '' Gibson has also been likened to `` a combination Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart . '' Gibson 's roles in the Mad Max series of films , Peter Weir 's Gallipoli , and the Lethal Weapon series of films earned him the label of `` action hero '' . Later , Gibson expanded into a variety of acting projects including human dramas such as Hamlet , and comedic roles such as those in Maverick and What Women Want . He expanded beyond acting into directing and producing , with : The Man Without a Face , in 1993 ; Braveheart , in 1995 ; The Passion of the Christ , in 2004 ; and Apocalypto , in 2006 . Jess Cagle of Time compared Gibson with Cary Grant , Sean Connery , and Robert Redford .

Since 1 January 1997 it has been governed by the England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) , having been previously governed by Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) from 1903 until the end of 1996 .   England and Australia were the first teams to play a Test match ( between 15–19 March 1877 ) , and these two countries together with South Africa formed the Imperial Cricket Conference ( predecessor to today 's International Cricket Council ) on 15 June 1909 . England and Australia also played the first One Day International ( ODI ) on 5 January 1971 . England 's first Twenty20 International ( T20I ) was played on 13 June 2005 , once more against Australia .   As of 25 July 2016 , England has played 974 Test matches , winning 349 and losing 283 ( with 342 draws ) . The team has won The Ashes on 32 occasions , the same number as their opponents Australia . The team has played 666 ODIs , winning 321 , and its record in major ODI tournaments includes finishing as runners-up in three Cricket World Cups ( 1979 , 1987 and 1992 ) , and also in two ICC Champions Trophys ( 2004 and 2013 ) . The team has played 86 T20Is , winning 42 . They won the ICC World Twenty20 in 2010 , and were runners-up in 2016 .   England are currently ranked fourth in Tests , fifth in ODIs and fifth in T20Is by the ICC .   History   The first recorded incidence of a team with a claim to represent England comes from 9 July 1739 when an `` All-England '' team , which consisted of 11 gentlemen from any part of England exclusive of Kent , played against `` the Unconquerable County '' of Kent and lost by a margin of `` very few notches '' . Such matches were repeated on numerous occasions for the best part of a century .   In 1846 William Clarke formed the All-England Eleven . This team would eventually compete against a United All-England Eleven with annual matches occurring between 1847 and 1856 . These matches were arguably the most important contest of the English season if judged by the quality of the players .   Early tours   The first overseas tour occurred in September 1859 with England touring North America . This team had six players from the All-England Eleven , six from the United All-England Eleven and was captained by George Parr .   With the outbreak of the American Civil War , attention turned elsewhere . English tourists visited Australia in 1861-62 with this first tour organised as a commercial venture by Messrs Spiers and Pond , restaurateurs of Melbourne . Most matches played during tours prior to 1877 were `` against odds '' , with the opposing team fielding more than 11 players to make for a more even contest . This first Australian tour were mostly against odds of at least 18/11 .   The tour was so successful that George Parr led a second tour in 1863–64 . James Lillywhite led a subsequent England team which sailed on the P & O steamship Poonah on 21 September 1876 . They would play a combined Australian XI , for once on even terms of 11 a side . The match , starting on 15 March 1877 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground came to be regarded as the inaugural Test match . The combined Australian XI won this Test match by 45 runs with Charles Bannerman of Australia scoring the first Test century . At the time , the match was promoted as James Lillywhite 's XI v Combined Victoria and New South Wales . The teams played a return match on the same ground at Easter , 1877 , when Lillywhite 's team avenged their loss with a victory by four wickets . The first Test match on English soil occurred in 1880 with England victorious ; this was the first time England fielded a fully representative side with W.G . Grace included in the team .   The Ashes   England lost their first home series 1–0 in 1882 with The Sporting Times printing an obituary on English cricket :   As a result of this loss the tour of 1882–83 was dubbed by England captain Ivo Bligh as `` the quest to regain the ashes '' . England with a mixture of amateurs and professionals won the series 2–1 . Bligh was presented with an"], [193, "Captain Pugwash is a fictional pirate in a series of British children 's comic strips and books created by John Ryan . The character 's adventures were adapted into a TV series , using cardboard cut-outs filmed in live-action ( the first series was performed and broadcast live ) , also called Captain Pugwash , first shown on the BBC in 1957 , a later colour series , first shown in 1974–75 , and a traditional animation series , The Adventures of Captain Pugwash , first aired in 1998 .   The eponymous hero – Captain Horatio Pugwash – sails the high seas in his ship called the Black Pig , ably assisted by cabin boy Tom , pirates Willy and Barnabas , and Master Mate . His mortal enemy is Cut-Throat Jake , captain of the Flying Dustman .   History   Captain Horatio Pugwash made his debut in a comic-strip format in the first issue of The Eagle in 1950 , then appeared regularly as a strip in Radio Times . In 1957 the BBC commissioned a series of short cartoon films produced by Gordon Murray . Ryan produced a total of 86 five-minute-long episodes for the BBC , shot in black-and-white film , but later transferring to colour . Ryan used a real-time technique of animation in which cardboard cutouts of the characters were laid on painted backgrounds and moved with levers . The characters ' voices were provided by Peter Hawkins . The last series of Pugwash shorts by Ryan was produced in 1975 .   Although there are many anachronisms in the series , the book The Battle of Bunkum Bay gives some useful clues as to the era in which the stories are set . In this book , the King of Great Britain strongly resembles George I and the King of France resembles Louis XIV , suggesting that this story took place in 1714–15 . However , one of the few direct references to a date is in the original TV series is the episode 'Pirate of the Year ' where Pugwash enters the `` Pirate of the Year contest 1775 ''   A number of spin-off books were written by John Ryan , who in the 1980s drew three new Pugwash comic-strip storybooks : The Secret of the San Fiasco , The Battle of Bunkum Bay and The Quest for the Golden Handshake .   A related book by John Ryan was Admiral Fatso Fitzpugwash , in which it is revealed that Pugwash had a medieval ancestor who was First Sea Lord , but who was terrified of water .   Episodes   Prior to the 1974–1975 series , the first generation of Captain Pugwash episodes were filmed in black and white and were first shown on British TV , between 1957 and 1966 . These early episodes , numbering a total of 87 episodes , with the producers using the production codes of CP001 to CP087 . These earlier episodes are in addition to the later 30 episodes , from the second generation of the series , which was produced in colour , between 16 September 1974 and 11 July 1975 . Captain Pugwash also sold overseas , to various TV stations , including Australia 's ABC Television . There the show was screened during weekday afternoons , in the 1970s and '80s .   The rights to Captain Pugwash were purchased by The Britt Allcroft Company , who since 1997 have issued a number of digital and part computer-animated cartoon films based on the Pugwash character , set on the island of `` Montebuffo '' , `` somewhere in the Spanish Main '' . Peter Hawkins did not provide the voices , HIT Entertainment instead employing character actor James Saxon .   A DVD containing , 'All 30 heroic high sea adventures from the second-generation colour 1974–1975 , series , ( 156 minutes running time ) was given away with the Sunday Times on 20 January 2008 .

His greed often gets him into trouble . Nevertheless , he usually wins the day – either with the help of Tom the Cabin Boy or by sheer luck . Despite being a pirate , he is rarely seen committing any acts of piracy .   Master Mate   A somewhat dopey character , who has a tendency to use malapropisms and to mispronounce common words .

Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape , interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the main input device for computers .   A keyboard typically has characters engraved or printed on the keys and each press of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol . However , to produce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously or in sequence . While most keyboard keys produce letters , numbers or signs ( characters ) , other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or execute computer commands .   Despite the development of alternative input devices , such as the mouse , touchscreen , pen devices , character recognition and voice recognition , the keyboard remains the most commonly used device for direct ( human ) input of alphanumeric data into computers .   In normal usage , the keyboard is used as a text entry interface to type text and numbers into a word processor , text editor or other programs . In a modern computer , the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software . A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all key presses to the controlling software . Keyboards are also used for computer gaming , either with regular keyboards or by using keyboards with special gaming features , which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations . A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer , such as Windows ' Control-Alt-Delete combination , which brings up a task window or shuts down the machine .  A command-line interface is a type of user interface operated entirely through a keyboard , or another device doing the job of one .   History   While typewriters are the definitive ancestor of all key-based text entry devices , the computer keyboard as a device for electromechanical data entry and communication derives largely from the utility of two devices : teleprinters ( or teletypes ) and keypunches . It was through such devices that modern computer keyboards inherited their layouts .   As early as the 1870s , teleprinter-like devices were used to simultaneously type and transmit stock market text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to stock ticker machines to be immediately copied and displayed onto ticker tape . The teleprinter , in its more contemporary form , was developed from 1907 to 1910 by American mechanical engineer Charles Krum and his son Howard , with early contributions by electrical engineer Frank Pearne . Earlier models were developed separately by individuals such as Royal Earl House and Frederick G. Creed .   Earlier , Herman Hollerith developed the first keypunch devices , which soon evolved to include keys for text and number entry akin to normal typewriters by the 1930s .   The keyboard on the teleprinter played a strong role in point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication for most of the 20th century , while the keyboard on the keypunch device played a strong role in data entry and storage for just as long . The development of the earliest computers incorporated electric typewriter keyboards : the development of the ENIAC computer incorporated a keypunch device as both the input and paper-based output device , while the BINAC computer also made use of an electromechanically controlled typewriter for both data entry onto magnetic tape ( instead of paper ) and data output .   From the 1940s until the late 1960s , typewriters were the main means of data entry and output for computing , becoming integrated into what were known as computer terminals . Because of the limitations of terminals based upon printed text in comparison to the growth in data storage , processing and transmission , a general move toward video-based computer terminals was effected by the 1970s , starting with the Datapoint 3300 in 1967 .   The keyboard remained the primary , most integrated computer peripheral well into the era of personal computing until the introduction of the mouse as a consumer device in 1984 . By this time , text-only user interfaces with sparse graphics gave way to comparatively graphics-rich icons on screen . However , keyboards remain central to human-computer interaction to the present , even as mobile personal computing devices such as smartphones and tablets adapt the keyboard as an optional virtual , touchscreen-based means of data entry .   Keyboard types   One factor determining the size of a keyboard is the presence of duplicate keys , such as a"], [195, "Anna-Lou `` Annie '' Leibovitz ( ; born October 2 , 1949 ) is an American portrait photographer . She photographed John Lennon on the day he was assassinated , and her work was used on two record albums by Joan Armatrading . She is the only woman to have held an exhibition at London ’ s National Portrait Gallery .   Leibovitz is much influenced by Richard Avedon , and his ‘ personal reportage ’ , developing close rapport with her subjects .   Early life   Born in Waterbury , Connecticut , on October 2 , 1949 , Anna-Lou Leibovitz is the third of six children of Marilyn Edith ( née Heit ) and Samuel Leibovitz . She is a third-generation American ; her father 's parents were Romanian Jews . Her mother was a modern dance instructor of Estonian Jewish heritage . Her father was a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force . The family moved frequently with her father 's duty assignments , and she took her first pictures when he was stationed in the Philippines during the Vietnam War .   At Northwood High School in Silver Spring , Maryland , she became interested in various artistic endeavors and began to write and play music . She attended the San Francisco Art Institute , where she studied painting . For several years , she continued to develop her photography skills while holding various jobs , including a stint on a kibbutz in Amir , Israel , for several months in 1969 .   Career   Rolling Stone   When Leibovitz returned to the United States in 1970 , she started her career as staff photographer , working for Rolling Stone magazine .  In 1973 , publisher Jann Wenner named Leibovitz chief photographer of Rolling Stone , a job she would hold for 10 years .  Leibovitz worked for the magazine until 1983 , and her intimate photographs of celebrities helped define the Rolling Stone look .   While working for Rolling Stone , Leibovitz became more aware of the other magazines and learned that she could work for magazines and still create personal work , which for her was the most important . She sought intimate moments with her subjects , who `` open their hearts and souls and lives to you '' .    She was awarded The Royal Photographic Society 's Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship ( HonFRPS ) in recognition of a sustained , significant contribution to the art of photography in 2009 .   Inspirations   Photographers such as Robert Frank and Henri Cartier-Bresson influenced her during her time at the San Francisco Art Institute . `` Their style of personal reportagetaken in a graphic waywas what we were taught to emulate . '' Leibovitz has also cited Richard Avedon 's portraits as an important and powerful example in her life .   The Rolling Stones   Leibovitz photographed the Rolling Stones in San Francisco in 1971 and 1972 , and served as the concert-tour photographer for the Rolling Stones ' Tour of the Americas '75 . Her favorite photo from the tour was a photo of Mick Jagger in an elevator .   Joan Armatrading   In 1978 Leibovitz became the first woman to photograph Joan Armatrading for an album . She did the photography for Armatrading 's fifth studio album To the Limit , spending four days at her house capturing the images . Leibovitz also did the photography for Armatrading 's live album , Steppin ' Out .   John Lennon   On December 8 , 1980 , Leibovitz had a photo shoot with John Lennon for Rolling Stone , and she promised him he would make the cover . She had initially tried to get a picture with just Lennon alone , as Rolling Stone wanted , but Lennon insisted that both he and Yoko Ono be on the cover . Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the couple 's Double Fantasy 1980 album cover , a picture Leibovitz loved , and she had John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor . Leibovitz recalls , `` What is interesting is she said she 'd take her top off and I said , 'Leave everything on'not really preconceiving the picture at all . Then he curled up next to her and it was very , very strong . You could n't help but feel that he was cold and he looked like he was clinging on to her . I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited"], [196, "Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles . It is related to bowls , boules and shuffleboard . Two teams , each with four players , take turns sliding heavy , polished granite stones , also called rocks , across the ice curling sheet towards the house , a circular target marked on the ice . Each team has eight stones . The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game ; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end , which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones . A game usually consists of eight or ten ends .   The curler can induce a curved path by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides , and the path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms who accompany it as it slides down the sheet , using the brooms to alter the state of the ice in front of the stone . A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation , and the skills of the curlers determine how close to the desired result the stone will achieve . This gives curling its nickname of `` chess on ice '' .   Origins and history   Curling was invented in medieval Scotland , with the first written reference to a contest using stones on ice coming from the records of Paisley Abbey , Renfrewshire , in February 1541 . Two paintings , `` Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap '' and `` The Hunters in the Snow '' ( both dated 1565 ) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder depict Flemish peasants curling—Scotland and the Low Countries had strong trading and cultural links during this period , which is also evident in the history of golf .   Evidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 uncovered ( along with another bearing the date 1551 ) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane , Scotland . Kilsyth Curling Club claims to be the first club in the world , having been formally constituted in 1716 ; it is still in existence today . Kilsyth also claims the oldest purpose-built curling pond in the world at Colzium , in the form of a low dam creating a shallow pool some 100 × 250 metres in size .   The word curling first appears in print in 1620 in Perth , Scotland , in the preface and the verses of a poem by Henry Adamson . The game was ( and still is , in Scotland and Scottish-settled regions like southern New Zealand ) also known as `` the roaring game '' because of the sound the stones make while traveling over the pebble ( droplets of water applied to the playing surface ) . The verbal noun curling is formed from the Scots ( and English ) verb curl , which describes the motion of the stone .   In the early history of curling , the playing stones were simply flat-bottomed river stones , which were of inconsistent size , shape and smoothness . Unlike today , the thrower had little control over the 'curl ' or velocity and relied more on luck than on precision , skill and strategy .   In Darvel , East Ayrshire , the weavers relaxed by playing curling matches using the heavy stone weights from the looms ' warp beams , fitted with a detachable handle for the purpose . Many a wife would keep her husband 's brass curling stone handle on the mantelpiece , brightly polished until the next time it was needed . Central Canadian curlers often used 'irons ' rather than stones until the early 1900s , Canada is the only country known to have done so , while others experimented with wood or ice-filled tins .   Outdoor curling was very popular in Scotland between the 16th and 19th centuries because the climate provided good ice conditions every winter . Scotland is home to the international governing body for curling , the World Curling Federation , Perth , which originated as a committee of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club , the mother club of curling .   Today , the game is most firmly established in Canada , having been taken there by Scottish emigrants . The Royal Montreal Curling Club , the oldest established sports club still active in North"], [197, "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ( ) , administered by the Nobel Foundation , is awarded once a year for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine . It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel , the inventor of dynamite , in his will . Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories . The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient ( s ) at an annual ceremony on 10 December , the anniversary of Nobel 's death , along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award . The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred Nobel as depicted on the medals for Physics , Chemistry , and Literature ; its reverse side is unique to this medal .   As of 2015 , 106 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded to 198 men and 12 women . The first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901 to the German physiologist Emil von Behring , for his work on serum therapy and the development of a vaccine against diphtheria . The first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , Gerty Cori , received it in 1947 for her role in elucidating the metabolism of glucose , important in many aspects of medicine , including treatment of diabetes .   Some awards have been controversial . This includes one to António Egas Moniz in 1949 for the prefrontal leucotomy , bestowed despite protests from the medical establishment . Other controversies resulted from disagreements over who was included in the award . The 1952 prize to Selman Waksman was litigated in court , and half the patent rights awarded to his co-discoverer Albert Schatz who was not recognized by the prize . The 1962 prize awarded to James D. Watson , Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for their work on DNA structure and properties did not acknowledge the contributing work from others , such as Oswald Avery and Rosalind Franklin who had died by the time of the nomination . Since the Nobel Prize rules forbid nominations of the deceased , longevity is an asset , one prize being awarded as long as 50 years after the discovery . Also forbidden is awarding any one prize to more than three recipients , and since in the last half century there has been an increasing tendency for scientists to work as teams , this rule has resulted in controversial exclusions .   Background   Alfred Nobel was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm , Sweden into a family of engineers . He was a chemist , engineer and inventor who amassed a fortune during his lifetime , most of it from his 355 inventions of which dynamite is the most famous . He was interested in experimental physiology and set up his own labs in France and Italy to conduct experiments in blood transfusions . Keeping abreast of scientific findings , he was generous in his donations to Ivan Pavlov 's laboratory in Russia , and was optimistic about the progress resulting from scientific discoveries made in laboratories .   In 1888 , Nobel was surprised to read his own obituary , titled `` The merchant of death is dead '' , in a French newspaper . As it happened , it was Nobel 's brother Ludvig who had died , but Nobel , unhappy with the content of the obituary and concerned that his legacy would reflect poorly on him , was inspired to change his will . In his last will , Nobel requested that his money be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the `` greatest benefit on mankind '' in physics , chemistry , peace , physiology or medicine , and literature . Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime , the last was written a little over a year before he died at the age of 63 . Because his will was contested , it was not approved by the Storting ( Norwegian Parliament ) until 26 April 1897 .   After Nobel 's death , the Nobel Foundation was set up to manage the assets of the bequest . In 1900 , the Nobel Foundation 's newly created statutes were promulgated by Swedish King Oscar II . According to Nobel 's will , the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden , a medical school and research center , is responsible for the Prize in Physiology or Medicine . Today , the prize is commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine ."], [198, 'Computer animation , or CGI animation , is the process used for generating animated images . The more general term computer-generated imagery encompasses both static scenes and dynamic images , while computer animation only refers to the moving images . Modern computer animation usually uses 3D computer graphics , although 2D computer graphics are still used for stylistic , low bandwidth , and faster real-time renderings . Sometimes , the target of the animation is the computer itself , but sometimes film as well .   Computer animation is essentially a digital successor to the stop motion techniques used in traditional animation with 3D models and frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations . Computer-generated animations are more controllable than other more physically based processes , constructing miniatures for effects shots or hiring extras for crowd scenes , and because it allows the creation of images that would not be feasible using any other technology . It can also allow a single graphic artist to produce such content without the use of actors , expensive set pieces , or props . To create the illusion of movement , an image is displayed on the computer monitor and repeatedly replaced by a new image that is similar to it , but advanced slightly in time ( usually at a rate of 24 or 30 frames/second ) . This technique is identical to how the illusion of movement is achieved with television and motion pictures .   For 3D animations , objects ( models ) are built on the computer monitor ( modeled ) and 3D figures are rigged with a virtual skeleton . For 2D figure animations , separate objects ( illustrations ) and separate transparent layers are used with or without that virtual skeleton . Then the limbs , eyes , mouth , clothes , etc . of the figure are moved by the animator on key frames . The differences in appearance between key frames are automatically calculated by the computer in a process known as tweening or morphing . Finally , the animation is rendered .   For 3D animations , all frames must be rendered after the modeling is complete . For 2D vector animations , the rendering process is the key frame illustration process , while tweened frames are rendered as needed . For pre-recorded presentations , the rendered frames are transferred to a different format or medium , like digital video . The frames may also be rendered in real time as they are presented to the end-user audience . Low bandwidth animations transmitted via the internet ( e.g . Adobe Flash , X3D ) often use software on the end-users computer to render in real time as an alternative to streaming or pre-loaded high bandwidth animations .   Explanation   To trick the eye and the brain into thinking they are seeing a smoothly moving object , the pictures should be drawn at around 12 frames per second or faster . ( A frame is one complete image . ) With rates above 75-120 frames per second , no improvement in realism or smoothness is perceivable due to the way the eye and the brain both process images . At rates below 12 frames per second , most people can detect jerkiness associated with the drawing of new images that detracts from the illusion of realistic movement . Conventional hand-drawn cartoon animation often uses 15 frames per second in order to save on the number of drawings needed , but this is usually accepted because of the stylized nature of cartoons . To produce more realistic imagery , computer animation demands higher frame rates .   Films seen in theaters in the United States run at 24 frames per second , which is sufficient to create the illusion of continuous movement . For high resolution , adapters are used .   History   Early digital computer animation was developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1960s by Edward E. Zajac , Frank W. Sinden , Kenneth C. Knowlton , and A. Michael Noll . Other digital animation was also practiced at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .   An early step in the history of computer animation was the sequel to the 1973 film Westworld , a science-fiction film about a society in which robots live and work among humans . The sequel , Futureworld ( 1976 ) , used the 3D wire-frame imagery , which featured a computer-animated hand and face both created by University of Utah graduates Edwin Catmull and Fred Parke . This imagery originally appeared in their student film A Computer Animated Hand , which they completed in 1971 .   Developments in CGI technologies are reported each year at SIGGRAPH ,'], [199, "The history of the camera can be traced much further back than the introduction of photography . Cameras evolved from the camera obscura , and continued to change through many generations of photographic technology , including daguerreotypes , calotypes , dry plates , film , and digital cameras .   Camera obscura   Photographic cameras were a development of the camera obscura , a device possibly dating back to the ancient Chinese and ancient Greeks , which uses a pinhole or lens to project an image of the scene outside upside-down onto a viewing surface .   An Arab physicist , Ibn al-Haytham , published his Book of Optics in 1021 AD . He created the first pinhole camera after observing how light traveled through a window shutter . Ibn al-Haytham realized that smaller holes would create sharper images . Ibn al-Haytham is also credited with inventing the first camera obscura .   On 24 January 1544 mathematician and instrument maker Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University used one to watch a solar eclipse , publishing a diagram of his method in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico in the following year . In 1558 Giovanni Batista della Porta was the first to recommend the method as an aid to drawing .   Before the invention of photographic processes there was no way to preserve the images produced by these cameras apart from manually tracing them . The earliest cameras were room-sized , with space for one or more people inside ; these gradually evolved into more and more compact models such as that by Niépce 's time portable handheld cameras suitable for photography were readily available . The first camera that was small and portable enough to be practical for photography was envisioned by Johann Zahn in 1685 , though it would be almost 150 years before such an application was possible .   Early fixed images   The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce ,   using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride , which darkened where it was exposed to light . No means of removing the remaining unaffected silver chloride was known to Niépce , so the photograph was not permanent , eventually becoming entirely darkened by the overall exposure to light necessary for viewing it . In the mid-1820s , Niépce used a sliding wooden box camera made by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier to experiment with photography on surfaces thinly coated with Bitumen of Judea . The bitumen slowly hardened in the brightest areas of the image . The unhardened bitumen was then dissolved away . One of those photographs has survived .   Daguerreotypes and calotypes   After Niépce 's death in 1833 , his partner Louis Daguerre continued to experiment and by 1837 had created the first practical photographic process , which he named the daguerreotype and publicly unveiled in 1839 . Daguerre treated a silver-plated sheet of copper with iodine vapor to give it a coating of light-sensitive silver iodide . After exposure in the camera , the image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt ( sodium chloride ) . Henry Fox Talbot perfected a different process , the calotype , in 1840 . As commercialized , both processes used very simple cameras consisting of two nested boxes . The rear box had a removable ground glass screen and could slide in and out to adjust the focus . After focusing , the ground glass was replaced with a light-tight holder containing the sensitized plate or paper and the lens was capped . Then the photographer opened the front cover of the holder , uncapped the lens , and counted off as many seconds—or minutes—as the lighting conditions seemed to require before replacing the cap and closing the holder . Despite this mechanical simplicity , high-quality achromatic lenses were standard .   Dry plates   Collodion dry plates had been available since 1855 , thanks to the work of Désiré van Monckhoven , but it was not until the invention of the gelatin dry plate in 1871 by Richard Leach Maddox that the wet plate process could be rivaled in quality and speed . The 1878 discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity finally made so-called `` instantaneous '' snapshot exposures practical . For the first time , a tripod or other support was no longer an absolute necessity . With daylight and a fast plate or film , a small camera could be hand-held while taking the picture . The ranks of amateur photographers swelled and"], [200, "Philip II of Spain ( ; 21 May 1527 – 13 September 1598 ) , called `` the Prudent '' ( el Prudente ) , was King of Spain ( 1556–98 ) , King of Portugal ( 1581–98 , as Philip I , Filipe I ) , King of Naples and Sicily ( both from 1554 ) , and during his marriage to Queen Mary I ( 1554–58 ) King of England and Ireland . He was also Duke of Milan . From 1555 , he was lord of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands .   Known in Spain as `` Felipe el Prudente '' ( ' '' Philip the Prudent ' '' ) , his empire included territories on every continent then known to Europeans , including his namesake the Philippine Islands . During his reign , Spain reached the height of its influence and power . This is sometimes called the Golden Age . The expression , `` the empire on which the sun never sets , '' was coined during Philip 's time to reflect the extent of his dominion .   During Philip 's reign there were separate state bankruptcies in 1557 , 1560 , 1569 , 1575 , and 1596 . This was partly the cause for the declaration of independence which created the Dutch Republic in 1581 . A devout Catholic , Philip is also known for organising a huge naval expedition against Protestant England in 1588 , known usually as the Spanish Armada , which was unsuccessful , mostly due to storms and grave logistical problems .   Philip was described by the Venetian ambassador Paolo Fagolo in 1563 as `` slight of stature and round-faced , with pale blue eyes , somewhat prominent lip , and pink skin , but his overall appearance is very attractive . '' The Ambassador went on to say `` He dresses very tastefully , and everything that he does is courteous and gracious . ''   Early years : 1527–54   The son of Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire , and his wife , Infanta Isabella of Portugal , Philip was born in the Spanish capital of Valladolid on 21 May 1527 at Palacio de Pimentel owned by Don Bernardino Pimentel ( the first Marqués de Távara ) . The culture and courtly life of Spain were an important influence in his early life . He was tutored by Juan Martínez Siliceo – the future Archbishop of Toledo . Philip displayed reasonable aptitude in arms and letters alike . Later he would study with more illustrious tutors , including the humanist Juan Cristóbal Calvete de Estrella . Philip , though he had good command over Latin , Spanish and Portuguese , never managed to equal his father , Charles V , as a polyglot . Despite being also a German archduke from the House of Habsburg , Philip was seen as a foreigner in the Holy Roman Empire . The feeling was mutual . Philip felt himself to be culturally Spanish ; he had been born in Spain and raised in the Castilian court , his native tongue was Spanish , and he preferred to live in Spain . This would ultimately impede his succession to the imperial throne .   In April 1528 , when Philip was eleven months old , he received the oath of allegiance as heir to the crown from the Cortes of Castile , and from that time until the death of his mother Isabella in 1539 , Philip was raised in the royal court of Castile under the care of his mother , and one of her Portuguese ladies , Dona Leonor de Mascarenhas , to whom he was devotedly attached . Philip was also close to his two sisters , María and Juana , and to his two pages , the Portuguese nobleman Rui Gomes da Silva and Luis de Requesens , the son of his governor Juan de Zúñiga . These men would serve Philip throughout their lives , as would Antonio Pérez , his secretary from 1541 .   Philip 's martial training was undertaken by his governor , Juan de Zúñiga , a Castilian nobleman who served as the commendador mayor of Castile . The practical lessons in warfare was overseen by the Duke of Alba during the Italian Wars . Philip was present at the Siege of Perpignan in 1542 , but did not see action as the Spanish army under Alba decisively defeated the besieging French forces under the Dauphin of France . On his way back to Castile , Philip received the oath of allegiance of the Aragonese Cortes at Monzón . His political training had begun a year previously under his father"], [201, "An opera house is a theatre building used for opera performances that consists of a stage , an orchestra pit , audience seating , and backstage facilities for costumes and set building . While some venues are constructed specifically for operas , other opera houses are part of larger performing arts centers .   History   The first public opera house came into existence in 1637 as the Teatro San Cassiano in Venice , Italy , in a country where opera has been popular through the centuries among ordinary people as well as wealthy patrons ; it still has a large number of working opera houses . In contrast , there was no opera house in London when Henry Purcell was composing and the first opera house in Germany was built in Hamburg in 1678 . Early United States opera houses served a variety of functions in towns and cities , hosting community dances , fairs , plays , and vaudeville shows as well as operas and other musical events .   In the 17th and 18th centuries , opera houses were often financed by rulers , nobles , and wealthy people who used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambitions and social positions or prestige . With the rise of bourgeois and capitalist social forms in the 19th century , European culture moved away from its patronage system to a publicly supported system . In the 2000s , most opera and theatre companies raise funds from a combination of government and institutional grants , ticket sales , and private donations .   Features     The Teatro San Carlo in Naples introduces the plant horseshoe , the oldest in the world , a model for the Italian theater . On this model were built following theaters of Italy and Europe , among others , the court theater of the Palace of Caserta , who will become the model for other theaters .  Given the popularity of opera in 18th and 19th century Europe , opera houses are usually large , with generally more than 1,000 seats and often several thousand . Traditionally , Europe 's major opera houses built in the 19th century contained between about 1,500 to 3,000 seats , examples being Brussels ' La Monnaie ( after renovations , with 1,700 seats ) , Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater ( with 1,636 ) , Warsaw 's Grand Theatre ( the main auditorium with 1,841 ) , Paris ' Opéra Garnier ( with 2,200 ) , the Royal Opera House in London ( with 2,268 ) and the Vienna State Opera ( the new auditorium with reduced capacity of 2,280 ) . Modern opera houses of the twentieth century such as New York 's Metropolitan Opera ( with 3,800 ) and the San Francisco Opera ( with 3,146 ) are larger . Many operas are better suited to being presented in smaller theatres , such as Venice 's La Fenice with about 1,000 seats .   In a traditional opera house , the auditorium is U-shaped , with the length of the sides determining the audience capacity . Around this are tiers of balconies , and often , nearer to the stage , are boxes ( small partitioned sections of a balcony ) .   Since the latter part of the nineteenth century , opera houses generally have an orchestra pit , where a large number of orchestra players may be seated at a level below the audience , so that they can play without overwhelming the singing voices . This is especially true of Wagner 's Bayreuth Festspielhaus where the pit is almost completely covered .   The size of an opera orchestra varies , but for some operas , oratorios and other works , it may be very large ; for some romantic period works ( or for many of the operas of Richard Strauss ) , it can be well over 100 players . Similarly , an opera may have a large cast of characters , chorus , dancers and supernumeraries . Therefore , a major opera house will have extensive dressing room facilities . Opera houses often have on-premises set and costume building shops and facilities for storage of costumes , make-up , masks , and stage properties , and may also have rehearsal spaces .   Major opera houses throughout the world often have highly mechanized stages , with large stage elevators permitting heavy sets to be changed rapidly . At the Metropolitan Opera , for instance , sets are often changed during the action , as the audience watches , with singers rising or descending as they sing . This occurs in the Met 's productions of operas such"], [202, "Rugby union , or simply rugby , is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century . One of the two codes of rugby football , it is based on running with the ball in hand . In its most common form , a game is between two teams of 15 players ( two more than rugby league ) using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line .   In 1845 , the first football laws were written by Rugby School pupils ; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the Blackheath Club 's decision to leave the Football Association in 1863 and the split between rugby union and rugby league in 1895 . Historically an amateur sport , in 1995 restrictions on payments to players were removed , making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time .   World Rugby , originally the International Rugby Football Board ( IRFB ) and from 1998 to 2014 the International Rugby Board ( IRB ) , has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886 . Rugby union spread from the Home Nations of Great Britain and Ireland , and was absorbed by many of the countries associated with the British Empire . Early exponents of the sport included Australia , New Zealand , South Africa and France . Countries that have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport include Fiji , Georgia , Madagascar , New Zealand , Samoa , Tonga and Wales . Rugby union is played in over 100 countries across six continents ; there are 101 full members and 18 associate members of World Rugby .   The Rugby World Cup , first held in 1987 , takes place every four years with the winner of the tournament receiving the Webb Ellis Cup . The Six Nations Championship in Europe and The Rugby Championship in the Southern Hemisphere are major annual competitions .   Major domestic competitions include the English Premiership in England , Top 14 in France , the Mitre 10 Cup in New Zealand and the Currie Cup in South Africa . Other transnational competitions include the Pro12 , involving Irish , Italian , Scottish and Welsh teams ; the European Rugby Champions Cup , involving the top European teams from their respective domestic competitions ; and Super Rugby , launched in 1996 with Australian , New Zealand and South African teams and since 2016 also including teams in Argentina and Japan .   History   The origin of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of English school football at Rugby School in 1823 , when William Webb Ellis is said to have picked up the ball and run with it . Although the evidence for the story is doubtful , it was immortalised at the school with a plaque unveiled in 1895 . Despite the doubtful evidence , the Rugby World Cup trophy is named after Webb Ellis . Rugby football stems from the form of game played at Rugby School , which former pupils then introduced to their university . Old Rugbeian Albert Pell , a student at Cambridge , is credited with having formed the first `` football '' team . During this early period different schools used different rules , with former pupils from Rugby and Eton attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities .   A significant event in the early development of rugby football was the production of the first written laws of the game at Rugby School in 1845 , which was followed by the 'Cambridge Rules ' drawn up in 1848 . Other important events include the Blackheath Club 's decision to leave the Football Association in 1863 and the formation of the Rugby Football Union in 1871 . The code was originally known as `` rugby football '' ; it was not until after the schism in England in 1895 , which resulted in the separate code of rugby league , that the sport took on the name `` rugby union '' to differentiate it from the league game . Despite the sport 's full name of rugby union , it is known simply as rugby throughout most of the world .   First internationals   The first rugby football international was played on 27 March 1871 between Scotland and England . Scotland won the game 1-0 . By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative teams , and in 1883 the first international competition , the Home Nations Championship had begun . 1883 is also the year of the first rugby sevens tournament"], [203, "Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water . In the vernacular both are referred to as 'canals ' . The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares its drainage basin , while a canal cuts across a drainage divide . Canals deliver water where there is lack of water .   Types of artificial waterways   A navigation is a series of channels that run roughly parallel to the valley and stream bed of an unimproved river . A navigation always shares the drainage basin of the river . A vessel uses the calm parts of the river itself as well as improvements , traversing the same changes in height .   A true canal is a channel that cuts across a drainage divide , making a navigable channel connecting two different drainage basins .   Most commercially important canals of the first half of the 19th-century were a little of each , using rivers in long stretches , and divide crossing canals in others . This is true for many canals still in use .   Structures used in artificial waterways   Both navigations and canals use engineered structures to improve navigation :  * weirs and dams to raise river water levels to usable depths ;  * looping descents to create a longer and gentler channel around a stretch of rapids or falls ;  * locks to allow ships and barges to ascend/descend .   Since they cut across drainage divides , canals are more difficult to construct and often need additional improvements , like viaducts and aqueducts to bridge waters over streams and roads , and ways to keep water in the channel .   Types of canals   There are two broad types of canal :  * Waterways : canals and navigations used for carrying vessels transporting goods and people . These can be subdivided into two kinds :  * Those connecting existing lakes , rivers , other canals or seas and oceans .  * Those connected in a city network : such as the Canal Grande and others of Venice Italy ; the gracht of Amsterdam , and the waterways of Bangkok .  * Aqueducts : water supply canals that are used for the conveyance and delivery of potable water for human consumption , municipal uses , hydro power canals and agriculture irrigation .   Importance   Historically canals were of immense importance to commerce and the development , growth and vitality of a civilization . Modern canals are a mere remnant of the numbers that once fueled 17th–20th century industries and economies . The surviving canals today primarily service only bulk cargo and large ship transportation industries , whereas the once critical inland boat and barge canals have largely been supplanted , initially by faster and cheaper to maintain railways , later by using the flexibility and slope climbing capability of lorries .   Construction   Canals are built in one of three ways , or a combination of the three , depending on available water and available path :  ; Human made streams  * A canal can be created where no stream presently exists . Either the body of the canal is dug or the sides of the canal are created by making dykes or levees by piling dirt , stone , concrete or other building materials . The water for the canal must be provided from an external source , like streams or reservoirs . Where the new waterway must change elevation engineering works like locks , lifts or elevators are constructed to raise and lower vessels . Examples include canals that connect valleys over a higher body of land , like Canal du Midi , Canal de Briare and the Panama Canal .  * A canal can be constructed by dredging a channel in the bottom of an existing lake . When the channel is complete , the lake is drained and the channel becomes a new canal , serving both drainage of the surrounding polder and provinding transport there . Examples include the . One can also build two parallel dikes in an existing lake , forming the new canal in between , and then drain the remaining parts of the lake . The eastern and central parts of the North Sea Canal were constructed in this way . In both cases pumping stations are required to keep the land surrounding the canal dry , either pumping water from the canal into surrounding waters , or pumping it from the land into the canal .  ; Canalization and navigations   * A stream can be canalized to make its"], [204, "Archer is an American adult animated spy comedy television series , created by Adam Reed for the FX network . The pilot episode of the series aired as a sneak peek on September 17 , 2009 , before the show made its official debut on January 14 , 2010 . On June 21 , 2016 , FX renewed the series for an eighth , ninth , and tenth season , each to consist of eight episodes . It was announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2016 that Season 8 will premiere in January 2017 , but the series is moving to FX ’ s sister network , FXX .   Premise   Originally working for the `` International Secret Intelligence Service '' ( ISIS ) in New York City , suave , profoundly self-centered master spy Sterling Archer deals with global espionage , as well as his domineering , emotionally-distant mother and boss Malory Archer , fellow ISIS agent and ex-girlfriend Lana Kane , and ISIS employees Ray Gillette , Cyril Figgis , Pam Poovey , Cheryl Tunt , and Dr. Algernop Krieger .   A season-long arc took place in the fifth season , re-configuring the show from a spy series to a Miami Vice-style satire of the drug industry . To reflect this , the season was titled Archer Vice . When ISIS is disbanded by the U.S. government , its employees take a stockpile of cocaine that they acquired from previous operations and form a drug cartel to fund their retirements . Meanwhile , Cheryl decides to launch a new career as a country singer .   In the sixth season , the series returned to the spy format , and essentially `` unrebooted '' the characters back to their personalities before the fifth season . However , some elements from the fifth season had a big impact on the series going forward , including new character introductions ( Lana Kane giving birth to her daughter , and Christian Slater playing a fictional version of himself ) , and the revelation of the CIA 's involvement in some of the events that happened during Archer Vice . The characters now started working as contractors for the CIA .   The seventh season once again retooled the show , after the characters were fired from the CIA and blacklisted from espionage in the sixth season finale following failure during a mission . They move to Los Angeles , California to start their own private detective agency , known as The Figgis Agency ( named after character Cyril Figgis ) . The show once again took on a serialized , season-long story arc .   Time period   The show 's time setting is comically anachronistic , deliberately mixing technologies , clothing styles and historical backdrops of different decades . The characters wear 1960s clothing and hairstyles , and many episodes feature references to the Soviet Union as a current nation , yet in the fourth-season episode `` Once Bitten '' , Turkmenistan is an independent nation rather than a Soviet republic . It also contains references to Fidel Castro as the current leader of Cuba . The show frequently uses pop-culture references which are contemporary to the 2010s , yet character backstories place them at older events — such as Woodhouse 's service in World War I , or Malory 's involvement in various espionage events of World War II and the Cold War era — which would require them to be much older than they are if the show were actually set in the 21st century .   The technological sophistication within the series also varies , with characters using dated computer technology ( e.g . reel-to-reel mainframe systems , desktop computers closely resembling the Macintosh XL , dot-matrix printers , and punch cards ) and making surveillance recordings on cassette tape rather than digitally , but also using modern technologies such as GPS devices , the Internet , laser gunsights , cryptocurrencies , USB flash drives and cellular phones ( season 6 saw the appearance of touchscreen devices and flip phones ) . This ambiguity is explicitly recognized in at least two episodes , in which characters are unable to answer when asked what year they think it is .   Episodes   Archer officially premiered on FX on January 14 , 2010 . The show 's seventh season , which premiered on March 31 , 2016 , was originally announced to contain 13 episodes , but creator Adam Reed later stated in an interview that the season would be a `` 10-episode story '' . Before season 7 premiered , the show was announced to be moved to sister network FXX to be paired with a"], [205, "Arden is an area , located mainly in Warwickshire , England , and also part of Staffordshire and Worcestershire traditionally regarded as extending from the River Avon to the River Tame . It was once heavily wooded , giving rise to the name 'Forest of Arden ' . It does not seem that the area was subject to forest law however .   History   Believed to be derived from a Brythonic word ardu- `` high '' ( cf . Welsh ardd ) , by extension `` highland '' , the area was formerly thickly forested and known as the Forest of Arden . Located near the geographical centre of England , the Forest of Arden , through which no Roman roads were built , was bounded by the Roman roads Icknield Street , Watling Street , Fosse Way , and a prehistoric salt track leading from Droitwich . It encompassed an area corresponding to the north-western half of the traditional county of Warwick , stretching from Stratford-on-Avon in the south to Tamworth ( in Staffordshire ) in the north , and included what are now the large cities of Birmingham and Coventry , in addition to areas that are still largely rural with numerous areas of woodland . The most important and largest settlement in the forest was the town Henley-in-Arden ( in a valley of the River Alne , approximately 15 miles southeast of Birmingham ) , the site of an Iron Age hillfort .   An ancient mark stone known as `` Coughton Cross '' is still present at the south western corner of the forest , at the junction of Icknield Street ( now A435 ) and the salt track . It is located at the southern end of the frontage of Coughton Court and is owned by the National Trust . According to local tradition , travellers prayed here for safe passage through the forest .   From around 1162 , until the suppression of the order in 1312 , the Knights Templar owned a preceptory at Temple Balsall in the middle of the Forest of Arden . The property then passed to the Knights Hospitaller , who held it until the Reformation during the 16th century .   Robert Catesby , leader of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 , was a native of Lapworth , a village in Arden . It is believed that many local families had resisted the Reformation and retained Catholic sympathies , possibly including the family of Shakespeare , whose paternal ancestors were from Temple Balsall .   Thorkell of Arden , a descendant of the ruling family of Mercia , was one of the few major English landowners who retained extensive properties after the Norman conquest , and his progeny , the Arden family , remained prominent in the area for centuries . Mary Arden , mother of William Shakespeare , was a member .   Shakespeare 's play As You Like It is set in the Forest of Arden , however it is an imaginary version incorporating elements from the Ardennes forest in Thomas Lodge 's prose romance Rosalynde and the real forest ( both as it was then , subjected to deforestation and enclosure , and the romanticized version of his youth ) .   Towns in the area include Hampton-in-Arden , Henley-in-Arden , and Tanworth-in-Arden .   Proposal for a new national forest   The Countryside Commission considered creating a new national forest in the area in 1989 , but the proposal was not taken up . A national forest has been established in the northern midlands however .   Heart of England forest   Publisher Felix Dennis planted substantial areas of woodland in the area , known as the Heart of England Forest and on his death in 2014 left most of his fortune to be used for this purpose . 3000 acres have been planted in Spernall , Dorsington and Honeybourne ."], [206, "The United Kingdom is a unitary governed within the framework of a constitutional monarchy , in which the Monarch is the head of state and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of government . Executive power is exercised by Her Majesty 's Government , on behalf of and by the consent of the Monarch , as well as by the devolved Governments of Scotland and Wales , and the Northern Ireland Executive . Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom , the House of Commons and the House of Lords , as well as in the Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies . The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature . The highest court is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom .   The UK political system is a multi-party system . Since the 1920s , the two largest political participation have been the Conservative Party and the Labour Party . Before the Labour Party rose in British politics , the Liberal Party was the other major political party along with the Conservatives . Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of parliamentary politics , the first-past-the-post electoral system used for general elections tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties , though each has in the past century relied upon a third party such as the Liberal Democrats to deliver a working majority in Parliament . A Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government held office from 2010 until 2015 , the first coalition since 1945 . The coalition ended following Parliamentary elections on May 7 , 2015 , in which the Conservative Party won an outright majority of 330 seats in the House of Commons , while their coalition partners lost all but eight seats .   With the partition of Ireland , Northern Ireland received home rule in 1920 , though civil unrest meant direct rule was restored in 1972 . Support for nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales led to proposals for devolution in the 1970s though only in the 1990s did devolution actually happen . Today , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland each possess a legislature and executive , with devolution in Northern Ireland being conditional on participation in certain all-Ireland institutions . The United Kingdom remains responsible for non-devolved matters and , in the case of Northern Ireland , co-operates with the Republic of Ireland .   It is a matter of dispute as to whether increased autonomy and devolution of executive and legislative powers has contributed to the increase in support for independence . The principal pro-independence party , the Scottish National Party , became a minority government in 2007 and then went on to win an overall majority of MSPs at the 2011 Scottish parliament elections and forms the Scottish Government administration . A 2014 referendum on independence led to a rejection of the proposal , but with 45 % voting to secede . In Northern Ireland , the largest Pro-Belfast Agreement party , Sinn Féin , not only advocates Northern Ireland 's unification with the Republic of Ireland , but also abstains from taking their elected seats in the Westminster government , as this would entail taking a pledge of allegiance to the British monarch .   The constitution of the United Kingdom is uncodified , being made up of constitutional conventions , statutes and other elements such as EU law . This system of government , known as the Westminster system , has been adopted by other countries , especially those that were formerly parts of the British Empire .   The United Kingdom is also responsible for several dependencies , which fall into two categories : the Crown dependencies , in the immediate vicinity of the UK , and British Overseas Territories , which originated as colonies of the British Empire .   History   The Crown   The British Monarch , currently Queen Elizabeth II , is the Chief of State of the United Kingdom . Though she takes little direct part in government , the Crown remains the fount in which ultimate executive power over Government lies . These powers are known as Royal Prerogative and can be used for a vast amount of things , such as the issue or withdrawal of passports , to the dismissal of the Prime Minister or even the Declaration of War . The powers are delegated from the Monarch personally , in the name of the Crown , and can be handed to various ministers , or other Officers of the Crown , and can purposely bypass the consent of Parliament .

This transition included going from hand production methods to machines , new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes , improved efficiency of water power , the increasing use of steam power , the development of machine tools and the rise of the factory system . Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment , value of output and capital invested ; the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods . The Industrial Revolution began in the United Kingdom and most of the important technological innovations were British .   The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history ; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way . In particular , average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth . Some economists say that the major impact of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history , although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries . At approximately the same time the Industrial Revolution was occurring , Britain was undergoing an agricultural revolution , which also helped to improve living standards .   Mechanised textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe in the early 19th century , with important centres in France . A major iron making centre developed in Belgium . Since then industrialisation has spread throughout the world . The precise start and end of the Industrial Revolution is still debated among historians , as is the pace of economic and social changes . GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy , while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies . Economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals and plants .   The First Industrial Revolution evolved into the Second Industrial Revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870 , when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport ( steam-powered railways , boats and ships ) , the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam-powered factories .   Etymology   The earliest recorded use of the term `` Industrial Revolution '' seems to have been in a letter from 6 July 1799 written by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto , announcing that France had entered the race to industrialise . In his 1976 book Keywords : A Vocabulary of Culture and Society , Raymond Williams states in the entry for `` Industry '' : `` The idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in Southey and Owen , between 1811 and 1818 , and was implicit as early as Blake in the early 1790s and Wordsworth at the turn of the [ 19th ] century . '' The term Industrial Revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late 1830s , as in Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui 's description in 1837 of la révolution industrielle . Friedrich Engels in The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 spoke of `` an industrial revolution , a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society '' . However , although Engels wrote in the 1840s , his book was not translated into English until the late 1800s , and his expression did not enter everyday language until then . Credit for popularising the term may be given to Arnold Toynbee , whose 1881 lectures gave a detailed account of the term .   Some historians , such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts , have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer . This is still a subject of debate among historians .   Important technological developments   The commencement of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations , beginning in the second half of the 18th century . By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies :  * Textiles – Mechanised cotton spinning powered by steam or water greatly increased the output of a worker . The power loom increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40 . The cotton gin increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor"], [208, "The 100 metres , or 100-meter dash , is a sprint race in track and field competitions . The shortest common outdoor running distance , it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics . It has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women .   The reigning 100 m Olympic champion is often named `` the fastest runner in the world . '' The World Championships 100 metres has been contested since 1983 . Jamaicans Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce are the reigning world and Olympic champions in the men 's and women 's 100 metres , respectively .   On an outdoor 400 metres running track , the 100 m is run on the home straight , with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race . Runners begin in the starting blocks and the race begins when an official fires the starter 's pistol . Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50–60 m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line .   The 10-second barrier has historically been a barometer of fast men 's performances , while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race . The current men 's world record is 9.58 seconds , set by Jamaica 's Usain Bolt in 2009 , while the women 's world record of 10.49 seconds set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988 remains unbroken .   The 100 m ( 109.361 yards ) emerged from the metrication of the 100 yards ( 91.44 m ) , a now defunct distance originally contested in English-speaking countries . The event is largely held outdoors as few indoor facilities have a 100 m straight .   US athletes have won the men 's Olympic 100 metres title more times than any other country , 17 out of the 27 times that it has been run .   Race dynamics   Start   At the start , some athletes play psychological games such as trying to be last to the starting blocks .   At high level meets , the time between the gun and first kick against the starting block is measured electronically , via sensors built in the gun and the blocks . A reaction time less than 0.1 s is considered a false start . The 0.2-second interval accounts for the sum of the time it takes for the sound of the starter 's pistol to reach the runners ' ears , and the time they take to react to it .   For many years a sprinter was disqualified if responsible for two false starts individually . However , this rule allowed some major races to be restarted so many times that the sprinters started to lose focus . The next iteration of the rule , introduced in February 2003 , meant that one false start was allowed among the field , but anyone responsible for a subsequent false start was disqualified .   This rule led to some sprinters deliberately false-starting to gain a psychological advantage : an individual with a slower reaction time might false-start , forcing the faster starters to wait and be sure of hearing the gun for the subsequent start , thereby losing some of their advantage . To avoid such abuse and to improve spectator enjoyment , the IAAF implemented a further change in the 2010 season – a false starting athlete now receives immediate disqualification . This proposal was met with objections when first raised in 2005 , on the grounds that it would not leave any room for innocent mistakes . Justin Gatlin commented , `` Just a flinch or a leg cramp could cost you a year 's worth of work . '' The rule had a dramatic impact at the 2011 World Championships , when current world record holder Usain Bolt was disqualified .   Mid-race   Runners normally reach their top speed just past the halfway point of the race and they progressively decelerate in the later stages of the race . Maintaining that top speed for as long as possible is a primary focus of training for the 100 m. Pacing and running tactics do not play a significant role in the 100 m , as success in the event depends more on pure athletic qualities and technique .   Finish   The winner , by IAAF Competition Rules , is determined by the first athlete with his or her torso ( not including limbs , head , or neck ) over the nearer edge of the finish line . When the placing"], [209, "Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci , more commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo ( 15 April 14522 May 1519 ) , was an Italian polymath whose areas of interest included invention , painting , sculpting , architecture , science , music , mathematics , engineering , literature , anatomy , geology , astronomy , botany , writing , history , and cartography . He has been variously called the father of paleontology , ichnology , and architecture , and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time . Sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute , helicopter and tank , he epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal .   Many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the `` Universal Genius '' or `` Renaissance Man '' , an individual of `` unquenchable curiosity '' and `` feverishly inventive imagination '' . According to art historian Helen Gardner , the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent in recorded history , and `` his mind and personality seem to us superhuman , while the man himself mysterious and remote '' . Marco Rosci notes that while there is much speculation regarding his life and personality , his view of the world was logical rather than mysterious , and that the empirical methods he employed were unorthodox for his time .   Born out of wedlock to a notary , Piero da Vinci , and a peasant woman , Caterina , in Vinci in the region of Florence , Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned Florentine painter Andrea del Verrocchio . Much of his earlier working life was spent in the service of Ludovico il Moro in Milan . He later worked in Rome , Bologna and Venice , and he spent his last years in France at the home awarded to him by Francis I of France .   Leonardo was , and is , renowned primarily as a painter . Among his works , the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time , their fame approached only by Michelangelo 's The Creation of Adam . Leonardo 's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon , being reproduced on items as varied as the euro coin , textbooks , and T-shirts . Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived.There are 15 significant artworks which are ascribed , either in whole or in large part , to Leonardo by most art historians . This number is made up principally of paintings on panel but includes a mural , a large drawing on paper and two works which are in the early stages of preparation . There are a number of other works that have also been variously attributed to Leonardo . Nevertheless , these few works , together with his notebooks , which contain drawings , scientific diagrams , and his thoughts on the nature of painting , compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary , Michelangelo .   Leonardo is revered for his technological ingenuity . He conceptualised flying machines , a type of armoured fighting vehicle , concentrated solar power , an adding machine , and the double hull , also outlining a rudimentary theory of plate tectonics . Relatively few of his designs were constructed or even feasible during his lifetime , as the modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering were only in their infancy during the Renaissance . Some of his smaller inventions , however , such as an automated bobbin winder and a machine for testing the tensile strength of wire , entered the world of manufacturing unheralded . A number of Leonardo 's most practical inventions are nowadays displayed as working models at the Museum of Vinci . He made substantial discoveries in anatomy , civil engineering , optics , and hydrodynamics , but he did not publish his findings and they had no direct influence on later science .   Today , Leonardo is widely considered one of the most diversely talented individuals ever to have lived .   Life   Childhood , 1452–1466   Leonardo was born on 15 April 1452 ( Old Style ) `` at the third hour of the night '' in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci , in the lower valley of the Arno river in the territory of the Medici-ruled Republic of Florence.His birth is recorded in the diary of his paternal grandfather Ser Antonio , as cited by Angela Ottino della Chiesa in Leonardo da Vinci , p. 83 He was the out-of-wedlock son of the"], [210, "Cheddar Gorge is a limestone gorge in the Mendip Hills , near the village of Cheddar , Somerset , England . The gorge is the site of the Cheddar show caves , where Britain 's oldest complete human skeleton , Cheddar Man , estimated to be over 9,000 years old , was found in 1903 . Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era ( 12,000–13,000 years ago ) have been found . The caves , produced by the activity of an underground river , contain stalactites and stalagmites . The gorge is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest called Cheddar Complex .   Cheddar Gorge , including the caves and other attractions , has become a tourist destination . In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers , following its appearance on the 2005 television programme Seven Natural Wonders , Cheddar Gorge was named as the second greatest natural wonder in Britain , surpassed only by Dan yr Ogof caves .  The gorge attracts about 500,000 visitors per year .   Geology   Cheddar is a gorge lying on the southern edge of the Mendip Hills . The maximum depth of the gorge is 137 m , with a near-vertical cliff-face to the south , and steep grassy slopes to the north . The B3135 road runs along the bottom of the gorge .   The area is underlain by Black Rock slate , Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the Carboniferous Limestone Series , which contain ooliths and fossil debris , on top of Old Red Sandstone and by Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Keuper . Evidence for Variscan orogeny is seen in the sheared rock and cleaved shales . In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils .   The gorge was formed by meltwater floods during the cold periglacial periods which have occurred over the last 1.2 million years . During the ice ages permafrost blocked the caves with ice and frozen mud and made the limestone impermeable . When this melted during the summers , water was forced to flow on the surface , and carved out the gorge . During warmer periods the water flowed underground through the permeable limestone , creating the caves and leaving the gorge dry , so that today much of the gorge has no river until the underground Cheddar Yeo river emerges in the lower part from Gough 's Cave . The river is used by Bristol Water , who maintain a series of dams and ponds which supply the nearby Cheddar Reservoir ,  via a 137 cm diameter pipe that takes water just upstream of the Rotary Club Sensory Garden , a public park in the gorge opposite Jacob 's Ladder .   The gorge is susceptible to flooding . In the Great Flood of 1968 the flow of water washed large boulders down the gorge , damaging the cafe and entrance to Gough 's Cave and washing away cars . In the cave itself the flooding lasted for three days . In 2012 the B3135 , the road through the gorge , was closed for several weeks following damage to the road surface during extensive flooding .   Ownership and commercialisation   The south side of the gorge is owned and administered by the Marquess of Bath 's Longleat Estate . The cliffs on the north side of the gorge are owned by The National Trust . Every year both of the gorge 's owners contribute funds towards the clearance of scrub bush and trees from the area .   Most of the commercial visitor activity in the gorge is on the Longleat-owned south side , including access to the two main commercial show caves and the visitor centre , which is operated by Longleat-owned company Cheddar Gorge and Caves Ltd under director Hugh Cornwell . Due to the fact that tourist numbers have dropped through the show caves from 400,000 a year in the 1980s to 150,000 , in 2013 Ceawlin Thynn , Viscount Weymouth who runs the Longleat estate on behalf of the family trust , proposed installation of a 600 m 18-gondola cable car estimated to cost £10M , taking visitors from the entrance area to the caves directly to the top of the southside cliffs . The National Trust have opposed the proposed development , stating that it will spoil the view and cheapen the experience , creating a `` fairground ride '' that will make the area feel more like an amusement park . If planning permission is gained in Spring 2014 , then operations would start in Spring 2016 .   Ecology   Notable species at the gorge"], [211, "Birds ( Aves ) are a group of endothermic vertebrates , characterised by feathers , toothless beaked jaws , the laying of hard-shelled eggs , a high metabolic rate , a four-chambered heart , and a lightweight but strong skeleton . Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm bee hummingbird to the ostrich . They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species , at approximately ten thousand , with more than half of these being passerines , sometimes known as perching birds or , less accurately , as songbirds .   The fossil record indicates that birds are the last surviving group of dinosaurs , having evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs . True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period , around . DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed off all other dinosaurs . Birds , especially those in the southern continents , survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling . Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie outside class Aves proper , in the broader group Avialae , have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period . Many of these early `` stem-birds '' , such as Archaeopteryx , were not yet capable of fully powered flight , and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks , and long bony tails .   Birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species ; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moas and elephant birds . Wings , which evolved from forelimbs , give most birds the ability to fly , although further speciation has led to some flightless birds , including ratites , penguins , and diverse endemic island species of birds . The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight . Some bird species of aquatic environments , particularly the aforementioned flightless penguins , and also members of the duck family , have also evolved for swimming . Birds , specifically Darwin 's finches , played an important part in the inception of Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection .   Some birds , especially corvids and parrots , are among the most intelligent animals ; several bird species make and use tools , and many social species pass on knowledge across generations , which is considered a form of culture . Many species annually migrate great distances . Birds are social , communicating with visual signals , calls , and bird songs , and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting , flocking , and mobbing of predators . The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous , usually for one breeding season at a time , sometimes for years , but rarely for life . Other species have polygynous ( `` many females '' ) or , rarely , polyandrous ( `` many males '' ) breeding systems . Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilized through sexual reproduction . They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents . Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching . Some birds , such as hens , lay eggs even when not fertilized , though unfertilized eggs do not produce offspring .   Many species of birds are economically important . Domesticated and undomesticated birds ( poultry and game ) are important sources of eggs , meat , and feathers . Songbirds , parrots , and other species are popular as pets . Guano ( bird excrement ) is harvested for use as a fertilizer . Birds prominently figure throughout human culture . About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century , and hundreds more before then . Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction , though efforts are underway to protect them . Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry .   Evolution and classification   The first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray in their 1676 volume Ornithologiae .  Carl Linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use . Birds are categorised as the biological class Aves in Linnaean taxonomy . Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the dinosaur clade Theropoda .   Definition   Aves and a sister group , the clade Crocodilia , contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria . During the late 1990s , Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all"], [212, "Top Hat the Musical is a 2011 stage musical based on the 1935 film of the same name , featuring music and lyrics by Irving Berlin with additional orchestration by Chris Walker . The show opened on 16 August 2011 at the Milton Keynes Theatre , touring the United Kingdom before transferring to the Aldwych Theatre in London 's West End . Top Hat won multiple 2013 Laurence Olivier Awards after receiving seven nominations . The musical closed in London on 26 October 2013 , with a UK and Ireland tour commencing in August 2014 .   Background   The musical is based on the 1935 film of the same name , with music by Irving Berlin . It took the show 's producer , Kenny Wax , sixteen months to obtain the rights from Berlin 's estate to adapt the film into a stage musical . A first read-through of the adapted script was held at Sadler 's Wells in November 2010 , and it was performed for the first time 76 years after the original film . The show features fourteen songs by Berlin , six more songs than the original production . Featuring a 31-person cast , the production was adapted from the original screenplay by Matthew White and Howard Jacques . The show was directed by White with choreography by Bill Deamer , set designs by Hildegard Bechtler , costume design by Jon Morrell , lighting by Peter Mumford , sound by Gareth Owen , new orchestrations by Chris Walker and musical supervision by Richard Balcombe .   The producers for the original tour and the West End production originally approached Anton du Beke to play Jerry Travers , before casting Strictly Come Dancing winner Tom Chambers in the role originated by Fred Astaire . During the competition Chambers was compared to Astaire , his hero . Astaire 's daughter was in the audience for the show 's opening in London , and described Chambers as `` wonderful '' : `` There will always be comparisons , but what this show has done is bring a version to the world to see for the future '' . Two of Berlin 's daughters described the show as `` a beautiful production '' : `` It could definitely give new life to these songs and to Top Hat for a younger generation '' .   Production history   The show had its world premiere on 16 August 2011 at the Milton Keynes Theatre , at the beginning of a 17-week UK tour stopping in Birmingham , Southampton , Salford , Plymouth , Norwich , Canterbury , Edinburgh and Leeds . The original cast included Summer Strallen as Dale Tremont , Tom Chambers as Jerry Travers , Martin Ball as Horace , Vivien Parry as Madge Hardwick , Ricardo Alfonso as Alberto Beddini and Stephen Boswell as Bates . An additional pre-West-End tour took place in spring 2012 , at the New Victoria Theatre in Woking from 13–17 March and the Bristol Hippodrome from 21–31 March .   The production then moved to the West End 's Aldwych Theatre on 19 April 2012 , with its opening night on 9 May and an initial booking until the end of January 2013 . Charlotte Gooch took over the role of Dale Tremont in November 2012 ; on 5 February 2013 Gavin Lee took over the role of Jerry , Broadway star Kristen Beth Williams took over as Dale , Clive Hayward became Horace and Alex Gaumond became Alberto . A final cast change took place after Gaumond left to play Miss Trunchbull in Matilda the Musical : Russell-Leighton Dixon , previously the understudy for Alberto , took over the part . Although the production 's run had been extended until April 2014 , it closed on 26 October 2013 .   A further 47-week tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland commenced at the New Wimbledon Theatre , on 12 August 2014 , running until July 2015 . Featuring a new cast , the production visited Wimbledon , Milton Keynes , Newcastle , Aberdeen , Edinburgh , Wolverhampton , Nottingham , Bristol , Glasgow , Leeds , Cardiff , Oxford , Manchester , Sheffield , Birmingham , Norwich , Canterbury , Plymouth , Southampton , Dublin , Belfast , Sunderland , Woking and Eastbourne . The tour was led by Charlotte Gooch , who reprises the role of Dale , Alan Burkitt as Jerry , Clive Hayward as Horace Hardwick , Rebecca Thornhill as Madge Hardwick , Sebastien Torkia as Alberton Beddini and John Conroy as Bates .

He is credited with bringing a gripping realism to film acting , and is often cited as one of the greatest and most influential actors of all time . He helped to popularize the Stanislavski system of acting , today more commonly referred to as method acting . Brando is most famous for his Academy Award-winning performances as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront ( 1954 ) and Vito Corleone in The Godfather ( 1972 ) , as well as influential performances in A Streetcar Named Desire ( 1951 ) , Viva Zapata ! ( 1952 ) , Julius Caesar ( 1953 ) , The Wild One ( 1953 ) , Reflections in a Golden Eye ( 1967 ) , Last Tango in Paris ( 1972 ) , and Apocalypse Now ( 1979 ) . Brando was also an activist for many causes , notably the African-American Civil Rights Movement and various Native American movements .   He initially gained acclaim and an Academy Award nomination for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams ' play A Streetcar Named Desire , a role that he had originated successfully on Broadway . He received further praise for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront , and his portrayal of the rebel motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture . Brando received Academy Award nominations for playing Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata ! ; Mark Antony in Joseph L. Mankiewicz 's 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar ; and Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in Sayonara ( 1957 ) , an adaption of James Michener 's 1954 novel . Brando was included in a list of Top Ten Money Making Stars three times in the 1950s , coming in at number 10 in 1954 , number 6 in 1955 , and number 4 in 1958 .   The 1960s proved to be a fallow decade for Brando . He directed and starred in the cult western film One-Eyed Jacks , a critical and commercial flop , after which he delivered a series of box-office failures , beginning with the 1962 film adaptation of the novel Mutiny on the Bounty . After 10 years , during which he did not appear in a successful film , he won his second Academy Award for playing Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola 's The Godfather , a role critics consider among his greatest . The Godfather was then one of the most commercially successful films of all time . With that and his Oscar-nominated performance in Last Tango in Paris , Brando re-established himself in the ranks of top box-office stars , placing sixth and tenth in the Money Making Stars poll in 1972 and 1973 , respectively . Brando took a four-year hiatus before appearing in The Missouri Breaks ( 1976 ) . After this , he was content with being a highly paid character actor in cameo roles , such as in Superman ( 1978 ) and The Formula ( 1980 ) , before taking a nine-year break from motion pictures . According to the Guinness Book of World Records , Brando was paid a record $ 3.7 million ( $ million in inflation-adjusted dollars ) and 11.75 % of the gross profits for 13 days ' work on Superman . He finished out the 1970s with his controversial performance as Colonel Kurtz in another Coppola film , Apocalypse Now , a box-office hit for which he was highly paid and which helped finance his career layoff during the 1980s .   Brando was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest movie star among male movie stars whose screen debuts occurred in or before 1950 . He was one of only three professional actors , along with Charlie Chaplin and Marilyn Monroe , named in 1999 by Time magazine as one of its 100 Most Important People of the Century . He died of respiratory failure on July 1 , 2004 , at age 80 .   Early life   Brando was born on April 3 , 1924 , in Omaha , Nebraska , to Marlon Brando , Sr. , a pesticide and chemical feed manufacturer , and Dorothy Julia ( née Pennebaker ) . Brando had two older sisters , Jocelyn Brando ( 1919–2005 ) and Frances ( 1922–1994 ) . His ancestry included German , Dutch , English , and Irish .

He was formerly manager of Ajax , Barcelona , AZ , Bayern Munich , the Netherlands and Manchester United . He is one of the most decorated managers in world football .   Before his career as a coach , Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Royal Antwerp , Telstar , Sparta Rotterdam , Ajax and AZ . He is also a fully qualified physical education teacher and has worked as such at high schools during various stages of his career as a semi-professional footballer .   After a brief spell as coach at AZ , Van Gaal served as assistant coach under Leo Beenhakker at Ajax and eventually took over as head coach in 1991 . Under his lead , the club won three Eredivisie titles , the UEFA Cup , and the Champions League . He moved to Barcelona in 1997 and won two Spanish league titles and one Copa del Rey . After some disagreements at Barcelona , he was appointed coach of the Netherlands national team , but failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup . Another brief spell at Barcelona followed before he became manager of AZ . After winning the Eredivisie with AZ in 2008–09 , he was hired by Bayern Munich on 1 July 2009 . In his first season at Bayern , he secured the Bundesliga title , won the DFB-Pokal , and reached the final of the Champions League . In July 2012 , he was appointed manager of the Netherlands for the second time and led them to third place at the 2014 FIFA World Cup , before leaving for Manchester United . He had a satisfactory first season . However , after only finishing fifth in his second season he was sacked and replaced by José Mourinho , despite winning the FA Cup .   Playing and early coaching career   Van Gaal was born in Amsterdam . As a youngster , he started playing for the Amsterdam amateur side RKSV 'De Meer ' . At the age of 20 , he joined the second team of Ajax , but was never chosen to play in the first team , which at the time boasted players such as Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens in the midfield positions . He was loaned to Belgian First Division side Royal Antwerp playing under Guy Thys with whom he was runner-up in the Belgian top division in 1974 and 1975 . After four years spent in Belgium , he returned to his homeland and made his Eredivisie debut for Telstar under the guidance of manager , Mircea Petescu , whom he followed to Sparta Rotterdam . He later joined AZ , where he also became assistant coach in 1986 . After a short career at AZ , he returned to Ajax to become Leo Beenhakker 's assistant . When Beenhakker left in 1991 , Van Gaal took over as manager .   Management career   Ajax ( 1991–1997 )   Van Gaal was Ajax manager from 1991 until 1997 and had a very successful tenure . Under Van Gaal , Ajax became the Eredivisie champions three times , in 1994 , 1995 ( notably going the entire 1994–95 season unbeaten in both the league and the Champions League ) and 1996 . He also led Ajax to the KNVB Cup in 1993 and the Johan Cruijff Shield in 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 . On the European scene , Ajax captured the UEFA Cup in 1992 and the UEFA Champions League in 1995 after beating Milan in the final . The latter win was followed by a 5–1 aggregate win over Real Zaragoza in the 1995 UEFA Super Cup . Late in 1995 , Ajax beat Brazilian side Grêmio on penalties to win the Toyota Cup ( formerly Intercontinental Cup ) . Ajax were also Champions League runners-up in 1996 after losing to Juventus on penalties .   Ajax was so successful under Van Gaal 's leadership that during the 1990s , the Dutch national team was dominated by Ajax players such as Patrick Kluivert , Marc Overmars , Dennis Bergkamp , Frank and Ronald de Boer , Edgar Davids , Clarence Seedorf , Winston Bogarde , Michael Reiziger , and Edwin van der Sar .   After serving out his contract at Ajax ( 1997 ) , Van Gaal received his knighthood in the Order of Orange-Nassau .

Under the microscope , they appear round ( cocci ) , and form in grape-like clusters .   The Staphylococcus genus includes at least 40 species . Of these , nine have two subspecies , one has three subspecies , and one has four subspecies . Most are harmless and reside normally on the skin and mucous membranes of humans and other organisms . Found worldwide , they are a small component of soil microbial flora .   Taxonomy   The taxonomy is based on 16s rRNA sequences , and most of the staphylococcal species fall into 11 clusters :   # S. aureus group – S. aureus , S. simiae  # S. auricularis group – S. auricularis  # S. carnosus group – S. carnosus , S. condimenti , S. massiliensis , S. piscifermentans , S. simulans  # S. epidermidis group – S. capitis , S. caprae , S. epidermidis , S. saccharolyticus  # S. haemolyticus group – S. devriesei , S. haemolyticus , S. hominis  # S. hyicus-intermedius group – S. agnetis , S. chromogenes , S. felis , S. delphini , S. hyicus , S. intermedius , S. lutrae , S. microti , S. muscae , S. pseudintermedius , S. rostri , S. schleiferi  # S. lugdunensis group – S. lugdunensis  # S. saprophyticus group – S. arlettae , S. cohnii , S. equorum , S. gallinarum , S. kloosii , S. leei , S. nepalensis , S. saprophyticus , S. succinus , S. xylosus  # S. sciuri group – S. fleurettii , S. lentus , S. sciuri , S. stepanovicii , S. vitulinus  # S. simulans group – S. simulans  # S. warneri group – S. pasteuri , S. warneri   A 12th group – that of S. caseolyticus – has now been moved to a new genus , Macrococcus , the species of which are currently the closest known relatives of Staphylococcus .

Also , the abbreviations Staph and S. when used with a species ( S. aureus ) are correctly italicized and capitalized ( though often errors in this are seen in popular literature ) . However , Staphylococcus is not capitalized or italicized when used in adjectival forms , as in a staphylococcal infection , or as the informal plural ( staphylococci ) .   The S. saprophyticus and S. sciuri groups are generally novobiocin-resistant , as is S. hominis subsp . novobiosepticus .   Members of the S. sciuri group are oxidase-positive due to their possession of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase . This group is the only clade within the staphylococci to possess this gene .   The S. sciuri group appears to be the closest relations to the genus Macrococcus .   S. pulvereri has been shown to be a junior synonym of S. vitulinus .   Within these clades , the S. haemolyticus and S. simulans groups appear to be related , as do the S. aureus and S. epidermidis groups .   S. lugdunensis appears to be related to the S. haemolyticus group .   S. petrasii may be related to S. haemolyticus , but this needs to be confirmed .   The taxonomic position of S. lyticans , S. pettenkoferi , S. petrasii , and S. pseudolugdunensis has yet to be clarified .

Jahangir Khan is originally from Neway Kelay Payan , Peshawar . During his career he won the World Open six times and the British Open a record ten times . From 1981 to 1986 , he was unbeaten in competitive play . During that time he won 555 matches consecutively , the longest winning streak by any athlete in top-level professional sports as recorded by Guinness World Records . He retired as a player in 1993 , and has served as President of the World Squash Federation from 2002 to 2008 , when he became Emeritus President .   Playing career   Jahangir was coached initially by his father , Roshan , the 1957 British Open champion , then by his late brother Torsam . After his brother 's sudden death he was coached by his cousin Rehmat Khan , who guided Jahangir through most of his career . Jahangir was physically very weak as a child . Though the doctors had advised him not to take part in any sort of physical activity , after undergoing a couple of hernia operations his father let him play and try out their family game .   In 1979 , the Pakistan selectors decided not to select Jahangir to play in the world championships in Australia , judging him too weak from a recent illness . Jahangir decided instead to enter the World Amateur Individual Championship and , at the age of 15 , became the youngest-ever winner of that event .   In November 1979 , Jahangir 's older brother Torsam , who had been one of the leading international squash players in the 1970s , died suddenly of a heart attack during a tournament match in Australia . Torsam 's death profoundly affected Jahangir . He considered quitting the game , but decided to pursue a career in the sport as a tribute to his brother .   Notable achievements   * Won World Amateur Championships at age 15  * Youngest ever World Open Champion ( aged 17 )  * Unbeaten in 555 consecutive matches over 5 years and 8 months  * Won the British Open Championship 10 times in succession ( 1982-1993 )  * Six-times World Open Champion  * First player to win World Open Championships without dropping a game  * Played the second longest match in the squash history 2.46 h   Five-year unbeaten run   In 1981 , when he was 17 , Jahangir became the youngest winner of the World Open , beating Australia 's Geoff Hunt ( the game 's dominant player in the late-1970s ) in the final . That tournament marked the start of an unbeaten run which lasted for five years and 555 matches . The hallmark of his play was his incredible fitness and stamina , which Rehmat Khan helped him build up through a punishing training and conditioning regime . Jahangir was quite simply the fittest player in the game , and would wear his opponents down through long rallies played at a furious pace .   In 1982 , Jahangir astonished everyone by winning the International Squash Players Association Championship without losing a single point .   The unbeaten run finally came to end in the final of the World Open in 1986 in Toulouse , France , when Jahangir lost to New Zealand 's Ross Norman . Norman had been in pursuit of Jahangir 's unbeaten streak , being beaten time and time again . `` One day Jahangir will be slightly off his game and I will get him '' , he vowed for five years .   Speaking about his unbeaten streak , Jahangir said : `` It was n't my plan to create such a record . All I did was put in the effort to win every match I played and it went on for weeks , months and years until my defeat to Ross Norman in Toulouse in 1986 . ''   `` The pressure began to mount as I kept winning every time and people were anxious to see if I could be beaten . In that World Open final , Ross got me . It was exactly five years and eight months . I was unbeaten for another nine months after that defeat .

Mikhail Gorbachev was the only person to occupy the office . Gorbachev was also General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union between March 1985 and August 1991 . He derived an increasingly greater share of his power from his position as president until he finally resigned as General Secretary after the Soviet coup d'état attempt of 1991 .   The presidency was an executive post , based on a mixture of the U. S. and French presidencies .   Prior to the creation of the post of president , the de jure head of state of the Soviet Union was the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet , who was often called `` president '' by non-Soviet sources . For most of the Soviet Union 's existence , all effective executive political power was in the hands of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , with the Chairman of the Presidium exercising largely symbolic and figurehead duties . Starting with Leonid Brezhnev in 1977 , the last four General Secretaries—Brezhnev , Yuri Andropov , Konstantin Chernenko and Gorbachev—simultaneously served as de jure head of state during their time in office .   The president was initially elected by the Congress of People 's Deputies and served as ex officio chairman of that body , but all future elections were to have been by popular vote . During the election of the president several candidates were nominated , among leading contenders were KGB persona Vadim Bakatin and Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov .   The Vice President of the Soviet Union was Gennady Yanayev , who briefly usurped Gorbachev as president in the 1991 attempted coup as leader of the State Committee of the State of Emergency .

Announcement   The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on 12 October 2007 . It stated that responses to indications of future climate changes must follow the precautionary principle , and that extensive changes would damage living standards , leading to likelihood of wars and violent conflicts . It paid tribute to the work of the IPCC :   It said that `` Al Gore has for a long time been one of the world ’ s leading environmentalist politicians '' , and described him as `` probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted . '' In conclusion , it said the Nobel Committee was `` seeking to contribute to a sharper focus on the processes and decisions that appear to be necessary to protect the world ’ s future climate , and thereby to reduce the threat to the security of mankind . Action is necessary now , before climate change moves beyond man ’ s control . ''   The award was given immediate publicity : an Associated Press article published by USA Today on 12 October 2007 and headlined `` Gore , scientists share Nobel Peace Prize '' quoted Pachauri as saying `` All the scientists that have contributed to the work of the IPCC are the Nobel laureates who have been recognized and acknowledged by the Nobel Prize Committee '' . He added that `` they should feel deeply encouraged and inspired . It is their contribution which has been recognized '' , and said `` I only happen to be a functionary that essentially oversees the process . '' On the same day , the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory listed its scientists who had contributed to the IPCC 's work , and said that Pachauri had sent a letter to lead authors of the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report saying that he had `` been stunned in a pleasant way with the news of the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for the IPCC . This makes each of you a Nobel Laureate and it is my privilege to acknowledge this honour on your behalf '' . The letter went on to say that `` The fact that the IPCC has earned the recognition that this award embodies , is really a tribute to your knowledge , hard work and application . ''   Presentation   In Oslo on 10 December 2007 , the presentation was made with a speech by Ole Danbolt Mjøs as Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee , and followed by Nobel Lectures given by Rajendra K. Pachauri , representing the IPCC , and Al Gore . In his lecture , Pachauri thanked those contributing to the IPCC :   IPCC certificates   The IPCC presented scientists who had `` contributed substantially to the preparation of IPCC reports '' with personalized certificates for `` contributing to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2007 to the IPCC '' . The certificates , which name the individual and feature a reproduction of the Nobel Peace Prize diploma , were sent to `` coordinating lead authors , lead authors , review editors , Bureau members , staff of the technical support units and staff of the secretariat from the IPCC ’ s inception in 1988 until the award of the prize in 2007 . ''   In a statement of 29 October 2012 the IPCC clarified that the `` prize was awarded to the IPCC as an organisation , and not to any individual involved with the IPCC . Thus it is incorrect to refer to any IPCC official , or scientist who worked on IPCC reports , as a Nobel laureate or Nobel Prize winner . It would be correct to describe a scientist who was involved with AR4 or earlier IPCC reports in this way : ' X contributed to the reports of the IPCC , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 .

''"], [219, "The original Siegfried Line ( ) was a First World War line of defensive forts and tank defences built by Germany in northern France during 1916–17 as a section of the Hindenburg Line . In English the term `` Siegfried Line '' commonly refers to the `` Westwall '' , the German term for a similar Second World War-era defensive line built further east during the 1930s opposite the French Maginot Line . This line stretched more than 630 km and featured more than 18,000 bunkers , tunnels and tank traps . The network of defensive structures stretched from Kleve on the border with the Netherlands , along the western border of the old German Empire , to the town of Weil am Rhein on the border to Switzerland . It was planned in 1936 and built between 1938 and 1940 .   Origin of the name Westwall   The official name for the Second World War-era defensive line construction program that collectively came to be known as the `` Westwall '' in German and `` Siegfried Line '' in English changed several times during the late 1930s reflecting areas in progress :   * Border Watch programme ( pioneering programme ) for the most advanced positions ( 1938 )  * Limes Programme ( 1938 )  * Aachen-Saar Programme ( 1939 )  * Geldern Emplacement between Brüggen and Kleve ( 1939–1940 )  * Western Air Defence Zone ( 1938 )   These programmes were all pushed forward with the highest priority , using every available resource . The origin of the name `` Westwall '' is unknown , but it appeared in popular use from the middle of 1939 ; there is a record of Hitler sending an Order of the Day to the soldiers and the workers at the `` Westwall '' on 20 May 1939 .   Construction programmes   Elements   Standard construction elements such as large Regelbau bunkers , smaller concrete `` pillboxes '' , and `` dragon 's teeth '' anti-tank obstacles were built as part of each construction phase , sometimes by the thousands . This standardisation was the most effective use of scarce raw materials , transport and workers .   `` Dragon 's teeth '' tank traps were also known as Höcker in German ( `` humps '' or `` pimples '' in English ) because of their shape . These blocks of reinforced concrete stand in several rows on a single foundation . There are two typical sorts of barrier : Type 1938 with four teeth getting higher toward the back , and Type 1939 with five such teeth . Many other irregular lines of teeth were also built . Another design of tank obstacle , known as the Czech hedgehog , was made by welding together several bars of steel in such a way that any tank rolling over it would get stuck . If the contour of the land allowed it , water-filled ditches were dug instead of tank traps . Examples of this kind of defence are those north of Aachen near Geilenkirchen .   Border Watch   Small bunkers with 50 cm thick walls were set up with three embrasures towards the front . Sleeping accommodations were hammocks . In exposed positions , similar small bunkers were erected with small round armoured `` lookout '' sections on the roofs . The programme was carried out by the Border Watch ( Grenzwacht ) , a small military troop activated in the Rhineland immediately after the region was re-militarised by Germany after having been de-militarised following the First World War .   Limes   The Limes Programme began in 1938 following an order by Hitler to strengthen fortifications on the western German border . Limes refers to the former borders of the Roman Empire ; the cover story for the programme was that it was an archaeological study .   Its Type 10 bunkers were more strongly constructed than the earlier border fortifications . These had thick ceilings and walls . A total of 3,471 were built along the entire length of the Siegfried Line . They featured a central room or shelter for 10-12 men with a stepped embrasure facing backwards and a combat section 50 cm higher . This elevated section had embrasures at the front and sides for machine guns . More embrasures were provided for riflemen , and the entire structure was constructed so as to be safe against poison gas .   Heating was from a safety oven , the chimney of which was covered with a thick grating . Space was tight , with about 1 m2 per soldier , who was given a sleeping-place"], [220, "São Paulo is one of the 26 states of the Federative Republic of Brazil and is named after Saint Paul of Tarsus . As the richest Brazilian state and a major industrial complex , often dubbed the `` locomotive of Brazil '' , the state alone is responsible for a third of Brazilian GDP . São Paulo also has the second highest Human Development Index ( HDI ) and GDP per capita , the fourth lowest infant mortality rate and the third lowest rate of illiteracy among the federative units of Brazil . If it were an independent country , its nominal GDP would be ranked among the top 20 in the world ( 2010 estimate ) .   With more than 45 millions inhabitants in 2014 , São Paulo is the most populous Brazilian state , the most populous national subdivision in the Americas , and the third most populous political unit of South America , surpassed only by the rest of the Brazilian Federation and Colombia . The local population is one of the most diverse in the country and descended mostly from Italians , who began immigrating to the country in the late 19th century ; of the Portuguese , who colonized Brazil and installed the first European settlements in the region ; indigenous peoples , a large number of distinct ethnic groups ; African peoples , who were brought from Africa in colonial era to be enslaved ; and migrants from other regions of the country . Other major immigration flows , as Arabs , Germans , Spanish , Japanese and Chinese , also had a significant presence in the ethnic composition of the local population .   The area that today corresponds to the state territory was already inhabited by indigenous peoples from approximately 12,000 BC . In the early 16th century , the coast of the region began to be visited by Portuguese and Spanish navigators . However , only in 1532 Martim Afonso de Sousa would establish the first Portuguese permanent settlement in the Americas - the village of São Vicente , in the Baixada Santista . In the 17th century , the paulistas bandeirantes intensified the exploration of the interior of the colony , which eventually expand the territorial domain of the Portuguese Empire in South America . In the 18th century , after the establishment of the Province of São Paulo , the region begins to gain political weight . After independence , during the Empire of Brazil , São Paulo begins to become a major agricultural producer ( mainly coffee ) , which ultimately create a rich regional rural oligarchy , which would switch on the command of the Brazilian government with the Minas Gerais 's elites during the early republican period . Under the Vargas Era , the state was one of the first to initiate a process of industrialization and its population becomes one of the most urban of the federation .   The city of São Paulo , the homonymous state capital , is ranked as the 12th largest city on the planet and its metropolitan area , with 20 millions inhabitants , is the 9th largest in the world and second in the Americas , after Greater Mexico City . Regions near the city of São Paulo are also metropolitan areas , such as Campinas , Santos , Sorocaba and São José dos Campos . The total population of these areas coupled with the capital – the so-called Expanded Metropolitan Complex – exceeds 30 million inhabitants , i.e . approximately 75 % of the population of São Paulo statewide , the first macro-metropolis in the southern hemisphere , joining 65 municipalities that together are home to 12 % of the Brazilian population .   History   Early period   In pre-European times , the area that is now São Paulo state was occupied by the Tupi people 's nation , who subsisted through hunting and cultivation . The first European to settle in the area was João Ramalho , a Portuguese sailor who may have been shipwrecked around 1510 , ten years after the first Portuguese landfall in Brazil . He married the daughter of a local chieftain and became a settler . In 1532 , the first colonial expedition , led by Martim Afonso de Sousa of Portugal , landed at São Vicente ( near the present-day port at Santos ) . De Sousa added Ramalho 's settlement to his colony .   Early European colonisation of Brazil was very limited . Portugal was more interested in Africa and Asia . But with English and French privateer ships just off the coast , the territory had to be protected .

Gable began his career as a stage actor and appeared as an extra in silent films between 1924 and 1926 , and progressed to supporting roles with a few films for MGM in 1931 . The next year , he landed his first leading Hollywood role and became a leading man in more than 60 motion pictures over the next three decades .   Gable won an Academy Award for Best Actor for It Happened One Night ( 1934 ) , and was nominated for leading roles in Mutiny on the Bounty ( 1935 ) and for his arguably best-known role as Rhett Butler in the epic Gone with the Wind ( 1939 ) .   Gable also found success commercially and critically with films such as Red Dust ( 1932 ) , Manhattan Melodrama ( 1934 ) , San Francisco ( 1936 ) , Saratoga ( 1937 ) Boom Town ( 1940 ) , The Hucksters ( 1947 ) Homecoming ( 1948 ) , and The Misfits ( 1961 ) , which was his final screen appearance .   Gable appeared opposite some of the most popular actresses of the time : Joan Crawford , who was his favorite actress with whom to work , was partnered with Gable in eight films , Myrna Loy worked with him seven times , and he was paired with Jean Harlow in six productions . He also starred with Lana Turner in four features , and with Norma Shearer and Ava Gardner in three each . Gable 's final film , The Misfits ( 1961 ) , united him with Marilyn Monroe ( also in her last screen appearance ) . Gable is considered one of the most consistent box-office performers in history , appearing on Quigley Publishing 's annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll 16 times . He was named the seventh-greatest male star of classic American cinema by the American Film Institute .   Life and career   Early life   William Clark Gable was born in Cadiz , Ohio , to William Henry `` Will '' Gable ( 1870–1948 ) , an oil-well driller , and his wife , Adeline ( née Hershelman ; 1869–1901 ) . Gable was named William after his father , but even in childhood , he was almost always called Clark . He was mistakenly listed as a female on his birth certificate . Among Gable 's ancestors were Pennsylvania Dutch ( German ) , Rhinelanders , and Bavarians . When he was six months old , his mother had him baptized as a Roman Catholic . She died when he was ten months old , possibly from a brain tumor . Will Gable refused to raise his son Catholic , provoking criticism from Adeline 's side of the family . The dispute was resolved when Will Gable agreed to allow his son to spend time with his maternal uncle , Charles Hershelman , and his wife on their farm in Vernon Township , Pennsylvania .   In April 1903 , Gable 's father married Jennie Dunlap ( 1874–1924 ) , whose family came from the small neighboring town of Hopedale . The marriage produced no children . Gable was a tall , shy child with a loud voice . His stepmother raised him to be well-dressed and well-groomed . Jennie played the piano and gave her stepson lessons at home . Later he took up brass instruments . At 13 , he was the only boy in the men 's town band . He was very mechanically inclined and loved to strip down and repair cars with his father . Though his father insisted on Gable doing `` manly '' things , like hunting and hard physical work , Gable loved language . Among trusted company , he would recite Shakespeare , particularly the sonnets . Will Gable agreed to buy a 72-volume set of The World 's Greatest Literature to improve his son 's education , but claimed he never saw his son use it . In 1917 , when Gable was in high school , his father had financial difficulties . Will decided to settle his debts and try his hand at farming , and the family moved to Ravenna , Ohio , near Akron . Despite his father 's insistence that he work the farm , Gable soon left to work in Akron 's B.F. Goodrich tire factory .   Early career   At 17 , Clark Gable was inspired to be"], [222, "The Muscovy duck ( Cairina moschata ) is a large duck native to Mexico , Central , and South America . Small wild and feral breeding populations have established themselves in the United States , particularly in Florida and the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas as well as in many other parts of North America , including southern Canada . Feral Muscovy ducks are found in New Zealand , Australia , and in parts of Europe .   They are large ducks , with the males about 76 cm long , and weighing up to 7 kg . Females are considerably smaller , and only grow to 3 kg , roughly half the males ' size . The bird is predominantly black and white , with the back feathers being iridescent and glossy in males , while the females are more drab . The amount of white on the neck and head is variable , as well as the bill , which can be yellow , pink , black , or any mixture of these . They may have white patches or bars on the wings , which become more noticeable during flight . Both sexes have pink or red wattles around the bill , those of the male being larger and more brightly colored .   Although the Muscovy duck is a tropical bird , it adapts well to cooler climates , thriving in weather as cold as and able to survive even colder conditions . In general , Barbary duck is the term used for C. moschata in a culinary context .   The domestic breed , Cairina moschata forma domestica , is commonly known in Spanish as the pato criollo ( `` creole duck '' ) . They have been bred since pre-Columbian times by Native Americans and are heavier and less able to fly long distances than the wild subspecies . Their plumage color is also more variable . Other names for the domestic breed in Spanish are pato casero ( `` backyard duck '' ) and pato mudo ( `` mute duck '' ) .   Description   All Muscovy ducks have long claws on their feet and a wide flat tail . In the domestic drake ( male ) , length is about 86 cm and weight is , while the domestic hen ( female ) is much smaller , at 64 cm in length and in weight . Large domesticated males often weigh up to 8 kg , and large domesticated females up to 5 kg .   The true wild Muscovy duck , from which all domesticated Muscovys originated , is blackish , with large white wing patches . Length can range from 66 to , wingspan from 137 to and weight from in wild Muscovys . On the head , the wild male has short crest on the nape . The bill is black with a speckling of pale pink . A blackish or dark red knob can be seen at the bill base , and the bare skin of the face is similar to that in color . The eyes are yellowish-brown . The legs and webbed feet are blackish . The wild female is similar in plumage , but is also much smaller , and she has feathered face and lacks the prominent knob . The juvenile is duller overall , with little or no white on the upperwing . Domesticated birds may look similar ; most are dark brown or black mixed with white , particularly on the head . Other colors such as lavender or all-white are also seen . Both sexes have a nude black-and-red or all-red face ; the drake also has pronounced caruncles at the base of the bill and a low erectile crest of feathers .   C. moschata ducklings are mostly yellow with buff-brown markings on the tail and wings . Some domesticated ducklings have a dark head and blue eyes , others a light brown crown and dark markings on their nape . They are agile and speedy precocial birds .   The drake has a low breathy call , and the hen a quiet trilling coo .   The karyotype of the Muscovy duck is 2n=80 , consisting of three pairs of macrochromosomes , 36 pairs of microchromosomes , and a pair of sex chromosomes . The two largest macrochromosome pairs are submetacentric , while all other chromosomes are acrocentric or ( for the smallest microchromosomes ) probably telocentric . The submetacentric chromosomes and the Z ( female ) chromosome show rather little constitutive heterochromatin ( C bands ) , while the W chromosomes are at least two-thirds heterochromatin .   Male Muscovy ducks have spiralled penises which can"], [223, "Persuasion is Jane Austen 's last completed novel , published posthumously . She began it soon after she had finished Emma and completed it in August 1816 . Persuasion was published in December 1817 , but is dated 1818 . The author died earlier in 1817 .   As the Napoleonic Wars come to an end in 1814 , Admirals and Captains of the Royal Navy are put ashore , their work done . Anne Elliot meets Captain Frederick Wentworth after seven years , by the chance of his sister and brother-in-law renting her father 's estate , while she stays for a few months with her married sister , living nearby . They fell in love the first time , but she broke off the engagement .   Besides the theme of persuasion , the novel evokes other topics , with which Austen was familiar : the Royal Navy , in which two of Jane Austen 's brothers rose to the rank of admiral ; and the superficial social life of Bath . It is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of Persuasion . In many respects , Persuasion marks a break with Austen 's previous works , both in the more biting , even irritable satire directed at some of the novel 's characters and in the regretful , resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine , Anne Elliot , in the first part of the story . Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy , which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing , engaged , and fulfilling life , and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel .   Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together , but also because both stories are set partly in Bath , a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted , having lived there from 1801 to 1805 .   Title as variation on a theme   Although readers of Persuasion might conclude that Austen intended `` persuasion '' to be the unifying theme of the story , the book 's title is not hers but her brother Henry 's , who named it after her untimely death . Certainly the idea of persuasion runs through the book , with vignettes within the story as variations on that theme . But there is no known source that documents what Austen intended to call her novel . Whatever her intentions might have been , she spoke of it as The Elliots , according to family tradition , and some critics believe that is probably the title she planned for it . As for Northanger Abbey , published at the same time , it was probably her brother Henry who chose that title as well .   On the other hand , the literary scholar Gillian Beer establishes that Austen had profound concerns about the levels and applications of `` persuasion '' employed in society , especially as it related to the pressures and choices facing the young women of her day . Beer writes that for Austen and her readers , persuasion was indeed `` fraught with moral dangers '' ; she notes particularly that Austen personally was appalled by what she came to regard as her own misguided advice to her beloved niece Fanny Knight on the very question of whether Fanny ought to accept a particular suitor , even though it would have meant a protracted engagement . Beer writes : Fanny ultimately rejected her suitor and after her aunt 's death married someone else .   Thus , Beer explains , Austen was keenly aware that the human quality of persuasion—to persuade or to be persuaded , rightly or wrongly—is fundamental to the process of human communication , and that , in her novel `` Jane Austen gradually draws out the implications of discriminating 'just ' and 'unjust ' persuasion . '' Indeed , the narrative winds through a number of situations in which people are influencing or attempting to influence other people—or themselves . Finally , Beer calls attention to `` the novel 's entire brooding on the power pressures , the seductions , and also the new pathways opened by persuasion '' .   Plot introduction   Over seven years before the novel opens , Anne Elliot , then a lovely , thoughtful , warm-hearted 19-year-old , accepted a proposal of marriage from the handsome young naval officer Frederick Wentworth . He was clever , confident , and ambitious , but poor and with"], [224, "A water clock or clepsydra ( Greek κλεψύδρα from κλέπτειν kleptein , 'to steal ' ; ὕδωρ hydor , 'water ' ) is any timepiece in which time is measured by the regulated flow of liquid into ( inflow type ) or out from ( outflow type ) a vessel where the amount is then measured .   Water clocks , along with sundials and hourglasses , are likely to be the oldest time-measuring instruments , with the only exceptions being the vertical gnomon and the day-counting tally stick . Where and when they were first invented is not known , and given their great antiquity it may never be . The bowl-shaped outflow is the simplest form of a water clock and is known to have existed in Babylon and in Egypt around the 16th century BC . Other regions of the world , including India and China , also have early evidence of water clocks , but the earliest dates are less certain . Some authors , however , claim that water clocks appeared in China as early as 4000 BC .   Some modern timepieces are called `` water clocks '' but work differently from the ancient ones . Their timekeeping is governed by a pendulum , but they use water for other purposes , such as providing the power needed to drive the clock by using a water wheel or something similar , or by having water in their displays .   The Greeks and Romans advanced water clock design to include the inflow clepsydra with an early feedback system , gearing , and escapement mechanism , which were connected to fanciful automata and resulted in improved accuracy . Further advances were made in Byzantium , Syria and Mesopotamia , where increasingly accurate water clocks incorporated complex segmental and epicyclic gearing , water wheels , and programmability , advances which eventually made their way to Europe . Independently , the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks , incorporating gears , escapement mechanisms , and water wheels , passing their ideas on to Korea and Japan .   Some water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade . These early water clocks were calibrated with a sundial . While never reaching a level of accuracy comparable to today 's standards of timekeeping , the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia , until it was replaced by more accurate pendulum clocks in 17th-century Europe .   A water clock , also known as a clepsydra , uses a flow of water to measure time . If viscosity is neglected , the physical principle required to study such clocks is the Torricelli 's law . There are two types of water clocks : inflow and outflow . In an outflow water clock , a container is filled with water , and the water is drained slowly and evenly out of the container . This container has markings that are used to show the passage of time . As the water leaves the container , an observer can see where the water is level with the lines and tell how much time has passed . An inflow water clock works in basically the same way , except instead of flowing out of the container , the water is filling up the marked container . As the container fills , the observer can see where the water meets the lines and tell how much time has passed .   Regional development   Persia   According to Callisthenes , the Persians were using water clocks in 328 BCE to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation . The use of water clocks in Iran , especially in Zibad , dates back to 500BCE . Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions , such as the Nowruz , Chelah , or Yaldā - the shortest , longest , and equal-length days and nights of the years . The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar .

The flexible late-night format meant that guests could do just about anything to be controversial . Talking about his TV career to Jo Brown of Cheers Magazine , Lamarr said The Word was :   After leaving The Word , Lamarr was an outside presenter on The Big Breakfast from 1992 to 1996 . Between 1995 and 1997 he appeared as a team captain in the surreal panel show Shooting Stars , where he displayed a mixture of dour boredom and contempt towards hosts Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer who , in turn , mocked his `` 50s throw-back '' appearance . Lamarr declined to return for the fourth series in 2002 , claiming he did not want to be typecast for appearing on panel shows . He said of his experience on the show :   Lamarr was host of Never Mind the Buzzcocks when the show launched in 1996 and continued in this role for 17 series until 2005 . Under Lamarr , the show grew a reputation as a scathing , almost rebellion like stand against the boy bands and pop music that had dominated the music scene since the early '90s , a theme that was kept by his successor . Although Lamarr initially intended to return to Buzzcocks after one series away , he was ultimately replaced by Simon Amstell from the 19th series .   The two series of the sitcom 15 Storeys High were co-written by Lamarr with comedian Sean Lock and Martin Trenaman , although Lamarr was credited under his real name , Mark Jones .   Radio   Lamarr has previously presented shows on BBC GLR , BBC Radio 5 and BBC Radio 1 . He also often guest presented the late night BBC Radio 2 show , sitting in for Mark Radcliffe . He hosted the show on the day that John Peel died ( 28 October 2004 ) . During this time he also had to cope with the BBC moving studios from Birmingham , so his link to Janice Long was often poor .   On 20 July 1998 , Lamarr launched a new show on BBC Radio 2 called Shake , Rattle and Roll , where he played tracks from his own sizeable record collection of obscure rock and roll gems . He also presented The Reggae Show series and Mark Lamarr 's Alternative '60s , where he presents lesser known tracks from the 1960s .   On 22 April 2006 , Lamarr started a new Radio 2 show called God 's Jukebox . The show aired from midnight to 3.00am on Saturdays where he played a wide variety of music from the previous 70 years including soul , ska , reggae , country , gospel and rap . He also , with Jo Brand , regularly covered the Jonathan Ross Saturday morning show on Radio 2 when Ross was away . His final God 's Jukebox show was broadcast Christmas Eve/Day , 2010 . At the end of 2010 Lamarr left Radio 2 , claiming the station had lost interest in non-mainstream music .   Lamarr presented a music show for British Airways on-board listeners as part of their in-flight entertainment . In this show he presented a mix of rock and roll , blues , reggae , soul and R 'n B .   Post-radio   Lamarr"], [226, "Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis . It can occur in four forms : skin , inhalation , intestinal , and injection . Symptoms begin between one day and two months after contracting the infection . The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless ulcer with a black center . The inhalation form presents with fever , chest pain , and shortness of breath . The intestinal form presents with nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or abdominal pain . The injection form presents with fever and an abscess at the site of drug injection .   Anthrax is spread by contact with the spores of the bacteria , which are often from infectious animal products . Contact is by breathing , eating , or through an area of broken skin . It does not typically spread directly between people . Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products , travelers , postal workers , and military personnel . Diagnosis can be confirmed based on finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by culture of a sample from the infected site .   The anthrax vaccine is recommended for people who are at high risk . Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred . Two months of antibiotics , such as doxycycline or ciprofloxacin , after exposure can also prevent infection . If infection occurs treatment is with antibiotics and possibly antitoxin . The type and number of antibiotics used depends on the type of infection . Antitoxin is recommended for those with widespread infection .   Anthrax among people is most common in Africa and central and southern Asia . It also occurs fairly regularly in southern Europe , but is uncommon in northern Europe and North America . Globally , at least 2,000 cases occur a year , with about two cases a year in the United States . Skin infections represent more than 95 % of cases . Without treatment the risk of death from skin anthrax is 24 % . For intestinal infection the risk of death is 25 % to 75 % while in inhaled anthrax despite treatment it is around 50 % to 80 % . Until the 20th century , anthrax infections killed hundreds of thousands of people and other animals each year . Anthrax has been developed as a weapon by a number of countries . In plant eating animals infection occurs when they eat or breathe in the spores while grazing . Carnivores may become infected by eating infected animals .   Signs and symptoms   Skin   Cutaneous anthrax , also known as Hide porter 's disease , is when anthrax occurs on the skin . It presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center ( eschar ) . The black eschar often shows up as a large , painless necrotic ulcer ( beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot , somewhat resembling bread mold ) at the site of infection . In general , cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure . Unlike bruises or most other lesions , cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain .   Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when B. anthracis spores enter through cuts on the skin . This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products .   Cutaneous anthrax is rarely fatal if treated , because the infection area is limited to the skin , preventing the lethal factor , edema factor , and protective antigen from entering and destroying a vital organ . Without treatment , about 20 % of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death .   Lungs   Respiratory infection in humans is relatively rare and initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days , followed by pneumonia and severe ( and often fatal ) respiratory collapse . Historical mortality rates were over 85 % , but , when treated early ( seen in the 2001 anthrax attacks ) , observed case fatality rate dropped to 45 % . Distinguishing pulmonary anthrax from more common causes of respiratory illness is essential to avoiding delays in diagnosis and thereby improving outcomes . An algorithm for this purpose has been developed .   Gastrointestinal   Gastrointestinal ( GI ) infection in humans is most often caused by consuming anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious GI difficulty , vomiting of blood , severe diarrhea"], [227, "In heraldry , gules is the tincture with the colour red , and belongs to the class of dark tinctures called `` colours '' . In engraving , it is sometimes depicted as a region of vertical lines or else marked with gu . as an abbreviation .   In Polish heraldry , gules is the most common tincture of the field . Through the sixteenth century , nearly half of all noble coats of arms in Poland had a field gules with one or more argent charges on them .   The original coat of arms of the d'Albret family was plain gules .   Sometimes , the different tinctures are said to be connected with special meanings or virtues , and represent certain elements and precious stones . Even if this is an idea mostly disregarded by serious heraldists throughout the centuries , it may be of anecdotal interest to see what they are , since people often ask for this information . Many sources give different meanings , but the gules tincture is often said to represent the following :  * of jewels , the ruby ;  * of heavenly bodies , Mars .   Etymology   The term `` gules '' derives from the Old French word goules , literally meaning `` throats '' ( related to the English gullet ; modern French gueules ) , but also used to refer to a fur neckpiece , usually made of red fur .   For many decades , heraldic authors have believed that the term may have arisen from the Persian word gol `` rose '' ( coming to Europe via Muslim Spain or brought back by returning Crusaders ) , but according to Brault there is no evidence to support this derivation ."], [228, "Opera ( ; English plural : operas ; Italian plural : opere ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text ( libretto ) and musical score , usually in a theatrical setting . In traditional opera , singers do two types of singing : recitative , a speech-inflected style and arias , a more melodic style . Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre , such as acting , scenery , and costumes and sometimes includes dance . The performance is typically given in an opera house , accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble , which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor .   Opera is part of the Western classical music tradition . It started in Italy at the end of the 16th century ( with Jacopo Peri 's lost Dafne , produced in Florence in 1598 ) and soon spread through the rest of Europe : Schütz in Germany , Lully in France , and Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century . In the 18th century , Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe ( except France ) , attracting foreign composers such as Handel . Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera , until Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his `` reform '' operas in the 1760s . In the 2000s , the most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Mozart , who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas , especially The Marriage of Figaro ( Le Nozze Di Figaro ) , Don Giovanni , and Così fan tutte , as well as The Magic Flute ( Die Zauberflöte ) , a landmark in the German tradition .   The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style , with Rossini , Donizetti and Bellini all creating works that are still performed in the 2000s It also saw the advent of Grand Opera typified by the works of Auber and Meyerbeer . The mid-to-late 19th century was a `` golden age '' of opera , led and dominated by Wagner in Germany and Verdi in Italy . The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Puccini and Strauss in the early 20th century . During the 19th century , parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe , particularly in Russia and Bohemia . The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles , such as atonality and serialism ( Schoenberg and Berg ) , Neoclassicism ( Stravinsky ) , and Minimalism ( Philip Glass and John Adams ) . With the rise of recording technology , singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans . Since the invention of radio and television , operas were also performed on ( and written for ) these mediums . Beginning in 2006 , a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas around the world . In 2009 , an opera company offered an online download of a complete performance .   Operatic terminology   The words of an opera are known as the libretto ( literally `` small book '' ) . Some composers , notably Richard Wagner , have written their own libretti ; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists , e.g . Mozart with Lorenzo Da Ponte . Traditional opera , often referred to as `` number opera '' , consists of two modes of singing : recitative , the plot-driving passages sung in a style designed to imitate and emphasize the inflections of speech , and aria ( an `` air '' or formal song ) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style . Vocal duets , trios and other ensembles often occur , and choruses are used to comment on the action . In some forms of opera , such as singspiel , opéra comique , operetta , and semi-opera , the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue . Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of , or instead of , recitative , are also referred to as arioso . The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in detail below . During both the Baroque and Classical periods , recitative could appear in two basic forms , each of which was accompanied by a different instrumental ensemble : secco ( dry ) recitative , sung with"], [229, "The Hunter Valley is one of Australia 's best known wine regions . Located in the state of New South Wales , the region has played a pivotal role in the history of Australian wine as one of the first wine regions planted in the early 19th century . Hunter Valley Semillon is widely considered the iconic wine of the region but the Hunter produces wine from a variety of grapes including Shiraz , Chardonnay , Cabernet Sauvignon and Verdelho .   Under Australia 's wine appellation system , the Hunter Valley zone Australian Geographical Indication ( GI ) covers the entire catchment of the Hunter River and its tributaries . Within that , the Hunter region is almost as large , and includes most of the wine-producing areas , excluding the metropolitan area of Newcastle and nearby coastal areas , some national parks , and any land that was in the Mudgee Shire ( at the western heights of the catchment ) . There are three named subregions in the Hunter region . These are the Upper Hunter Valley , Broke Fordwich and Pokolbin subregions . The Lower Hunter Valley is not strictly defined , but in general includes the Pokolbin subregion , along with the districts around Wollombi , Mount View , Cessnock and Lovedale . Much of the history of Hunter was played out in this area and it is generally what is referred as the Hunter Valley wine country . The majority of the Hunter Valley 's most prestigious vineyards are located on the southern valley and foothills of the Brokenback Range ( part of the Great Dividing Range ) . The topography of the Hunter includes mostly gently sloping hills with modest gradients . The one notable exception are the vineyards of Mount View just west of the town of Cessnock . The terrain of the Upper Hunter is noticeably flatter as the Goulburn River and other tributaries of the Hunter River dominate the area .   Despite being the area 's namesake , the Hunter River itself is not the dominant feature of the region—falling behind the Brokenback Range for that distinction . The greater river system of the Hunter , which includes the Goulburn and important tributaries such as Giants Creek , do provide needed irrigation for areas such as the Upper Hunter than can be prone to drought condition . The origins of the river begin the Liverpool Range of the volcanic Barrington Tops and flows south and then east down to the Pacific Ocean at the seaport city of Newcastle .   The success of the Hunter Valley wine industry has been dominated by its proximity to Sydney with its settlement and plantings in the 19th century fuelled by the trade network that linked the valley to the city . The steady demand of consumers from Sydney continues to drive much of the Hunter Valley wine industry , including a factor in the economy by the tourism industry .   History   Over 30,000 years ago the Wonnarua tribe of aboriginal Australians inhabited the land that is now known as the Hunter Valley wine region . Along with the Worimi tribe to the north and the Awabakal to the south , the Wonnarua developed a trading route connecting the Coquun ( Hunter ) Valley to the harbour now known as Sydney harbour .   The wine-making history of Hunter Valley begins with the European settlement of the Sydney and the New South Wales region of Australia in the late 18th century as a penal colony of the British Empire . The Hunter River itself was discovered , by accident , in 1797 by British Lieutenant John Shortland as he searched for escaped convicts . The region soon became a valuable source for timber and coal that fuelled the steamship trade coming out of Sydney .   Grapevines were planted in Sydney soon after its discovery in 1788 and as settlements fanned northward up towards the Hunter , government authorities actively encouraged plantings as a means of promoting both public sobriety and safety . The logic behind the promotion of viticulture and winemaking was that men tend to become more drunk and disorderly when under the influence of highly alcoholic spirits . If enough wine was provided , it was believed , it could be a moderate influence that could tame the `` savagery '' .   It was under these auspices that the grapevine followed land prospector John Howe as he cut a path through the Australian wilderness from Sydney up to the overland area in what is now known as the ( Lower ) Hunter Valley proper in 1820 . Today , the modern Putty Road between the cities of Windsor and"], [230, "From the 1340s to the 19th century , excluding two brief intervals in the 1360s and the 1420s , the kings and queens of England ( and , later , of Great Britain ) also claimed the throne of France . The claim dates from Edward III , who claimed the French throne in 1340 as the sororal nephew of the last direct Capetian , Charles IV . Edward and his heirs fought the Hundred Years War to enforce this claim , and were briefly successful in the 1420s under Henry V and Henry VI , but the House of Valois , a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty , was ultimately victorious and retained control of France . Despite this , English and British monarchs continued to prominently call themselves kings of France , and the French fleur-de-lys were included in the royal arms . This continued until 1801 , by which time France had no monarch , having become a republic . The Jacobite claimants , however , did not explicitly relinquish the claim .   Overview   The title was first assumed in 1340 by Edward III of England , the Kingdom of England being ruled by the French Plantagenet dynasty at the time . Edward III claimed the throne of France after the death of his uncle Charles IV of France . At the time of Charles IV 's death in 1328 , Edward was his nearest male relative through Edward 's mother Isabella of France . Since the election of Hugh Capet in 987 , the French crown had always passed based on male-line relations ( father to son until 1316 ) . There was no precedent for someone succeeding to the French throne based on his maternal ancestry , nor had there been a need to . There had been no shortage of sons for more than three centuries from the inception of the House of Capet until the early 14th century , when new precedents concerning female inheritance finally had to be introduced . On the death of Philip IV the Fair 's son Louis X in 1316 , immediately followed by that of his posthumous son John I , it had to be decided whether his young daughter Joan or his brother Philip would succeed to the throne . Philip arranged for his coronation , and became Philip V of France . He was challenged by the supporters of the Princess Joan , daughter of Louis X , on the basis of his right to the throne . In response , he convened an assembly of prelates , barons , and burgesses at Paris , who acknowledged him as their lawful king , and declared that `` Women do not succeed to the throne of France . '' This was later said to have been based on the 5th century Salic law , but it is now known that the Salic Law was only rediscovered later and used by the lawyers of the Valois kings to fortify their masters ' title with an additional aura of authenticity .   At the time of Charles 's death in 1328 , there was once again a dispute over the succession . Although it had come to be accepted that a woman could not possess the French throne in her own right , Edward III , the nephew of the deceased king and thus the nearest adult male relative , based his claim on the theory that a woman could transmit a right of inheritance to her son . This claim was rejected by French jurists however , under the principle Nemo plus juris ad alium transfere potest quam ipse habet ( no one can transfer a greater right to another than he himself has ) , and the throne was given to the male line heir , Philip , Count of Valois , a first cousin of the deceased king . At the time , Edward accepted this result , and paid homage to Philip VI for his Duchy of Aquitaine . However , in 1337 , Edward , in his capacity as Duke of Aquitaine , refused to pay homage to Philip . The French king 's response was to confiscate what was left of lands in English held Aquitaine , namely Gascony , thus precipitating the Hundred Years ' War and Edward 's revival of his claim to the throne and title of King of France in 1340 .   The decision to assume the title of `` King of France '' was made at the solicitation of his Flemish allies , who had signed a treaty that they would no longer attack the French king . They said that if Edward took the French royal title ,"], [231, "`` Who 's on First ? '' is a comedy routine made famous by Abbott and Costello . The premise of the sketch is that Abbott is identifying the players on a baseball team for Costello , but their names and nicknames can be interpreted as non-responsive answers to Costello 's questions . For example , the first baseman is named `` Who '' ; thus , the utterance `` Who 's on first '' is ambiguous between the question ( `` Which person is the first baseman ? '' ) and the answer ( `` The name of the first baseman is 'Who ' '' ) .   History   `` Who 's on First ? '' is descended from turn-of-the-century burlesque sketches that used plays on words and names . Examples are `` The Baker Scene '' ( the shop is located on Watt Street ) and `` Who Dyed '' ( the owner is named `` Who '' ) . In the 1930 movie Cracked Nuts , comedians Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey examine a map of a mythical kingdom with dialogue like this : `` What is next to Which . '' `` What is the name of the town next to Which ? '' `` Yes . '' In English music halls ( England 's equivalent of vaudeville theatres ) , comedian Will Hay performed a routine in the early 1930s ( and possibly earlier ) as a schoolmaster interviewing a schoolboy named Howe who came from Ware but now lives in Wye . By the early 1930s , a `` Baseball Routine '' had become a standard bit for burlesque comics across the United States . Abbott 's wife recalled him performing the routine with another comedian before teaming with Costello .   Bud Abbott stated that it was taken from an older routine called `` Who 's The Boss ? `` , a performance of which can be heard in an episode of the radio comedy program It Pays to Be Ignorant from the 1940s . After they formally teamed up in burlesque in 1936 , he and Costello continued to hone the sketch . It was a big hit in 1937 , when they performed the routine in a touring vaudeville revue called `` Hollywood Bandwagon '' .   In February 1938 , Abbott and Costello joined the cast of The Kate Smith Hour radio program , and the sketch was first performed for a national radio audience that March . The routine may have been further polished before this broadcast by burlesque producer John Grant , who became the team 's writer , and Will Glickman , a staff writer on the radio show . Glickman may have added the nicknames of then-contemporary baseball players like Dizzy and Daffy Dean to set up the routine 's premise . This version , with extensive wordplay based on the fact that most of the fictional baseball team 's players had `` strange nicknames '' that seemed to be questions , became known as `` Who 's on First ? '' Some versions continue with references to Enos Slaughter , which Costello misunderstands as `` He knows '' Slaughter . By 1944 , Abbott and Costello had the routine copyrighted .   Abbott and Costello performed `` Who 's on First ? '' numerous times in their careers , rarely performing it exactly the same way twice . They did the routine for President Franklin Roosevelt several times . An abridged version was featured in the team 's 1940 film debut , One Night in the Tropics . The duo reprised the bit in their 1945 film The Naughty Nineties , and it is that longer version which is considered their finest recorded rendition . They also performed `` Who 's on First ? '' numerous times on radio and television ( notably in The Abbott and Costello Show episode `` The Actor 's Home '' , widely considered the definitive version ) .   In 1956 , a gold record of `` Who 's on First ? '' was placed in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown , New York . A video ( taken from The Naughty Nineties ) now plays continuously on screens at the Hall .   In the 1970s , Selchow and Righter published a `` Who 's on First ? '' board game .   In 1999 , Time named the routine Best Comedy Sketch of the 20th century .   An early radio recording was placed in the Library of Congress 's National Recording Registry in 2003 .   In 2005 , the line `` Who 's on First ? '' was included"], [232, "The Winter Olympic Games ( French : Jeux olympiques d'hiver ) is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years . Unlike the Summer Olympics , the Winter Olympics feature sports practiced on snow and ice . The first Winter Olympics , the 1924 Winter Olympics , was held in Chamonix , France . The original five sports ( broken into nine disciplines ) were bobsleigh , curling , ice hockey , Nordic skiing ( consisting of the disciplines military patrol , cross-country skiing , Nordic combined , and ski jumping ) , and skating ( consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating ) . The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936 , after which they were interrupted by World War II . The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years . Until 1992 , the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years , but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years , the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994 .   The Winter Games have evolved since its inception . Sports and disciplines have been added and some of them , such as Alpine skiing , luge , short track speed skating , freestyle skiing , skeleton , and snowboarding , have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic program . Others ( such as curling and bobsleigh ) have been discontinued and later reintroduced , or have been permanently discontinued ( such as military patrol , though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it ) . Still others , such as speed skiing , bandy and skijoring , were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports . The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced the profile of the Games . It created an income stream , via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising , which has become lucrative for the IOC . This allowed outside interests , such as television companies and corporate sponsors , to exert influence . The IOC has had to address several criticisms , internal scandals , the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians , as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics . Nations have used the Winter Games to showcase the claimed superiority of their political systems .   The Winter Olympics has been hosted on three continents by eleven different countries . The United States has hosted the Games four times ( 1932 , 1960 , 1980 , 2002 ) ; France has been the host three times ( 1924 , 1968 , 1992 ) ; Austria ( 1964 , 1976 ) , Canada ( 1988 , 2010 ) , Japan ( 1972 , 1998 ) , Italy ( 1956 , 2006 ) , Norway ( 1952 , 1994 ) , and Switzerland ( 1928 , 1948 ) have hosted the Games twice . Germany ( 1936 ) , Yugoslavia ( 1984 ) , and Russia ( 2014 ) have hosted the Games once . The IOC has selected Pyeongchang , South Korea , to host the 2018 Winter Olympics and Beijing , China , to host the 2022 Winter Olympics . No country in the southern hemisphere has hosted or even been an applicant to host the Winter Olympics ; the major challenge preventing one hosting the games is the dependence on winter weather , and the traditional February timing of the games falls in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer .   Twelve countries – Austria , Canada , Finland , France , Great Britain , Hungary , Italy , Norway , Poland , Sweden , Switzerland and the United States – have sent athletes to every Winter Olympic Games . Six of those – Austria , Canada , Finland , Norway , Sweden and the United States – have earned medals at every Winter Olympic Games , and only one – the United States – has earned gold at each Games . Germany and Japan have been banned at times from competing in the Games .   Sports   The Olympic Charter limits winter sports to `` those ... which are practised on snow or ice . '' Since 1992 a number of new sports have been added to the Olympic programme ; which include short track speed skating , snowboarding , freestyle and moguls skiing . The addition of these events has broadened the appeal of the Winter Olympics beyond Europe and North America . While European powers such as Norway and Germany still dominate the traditional"], [233, "Puerto Rico ( Spanish for 'Rich Port ' ) ( or ; , ) , officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( , `` Associated Free State of Puerto Rico '' ) is the largest insular territory of the United States , and it is located in the northeastern Caribbean Sea . It is an archipelago that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller islands such as Mona , Culebra , and Vieques . The capital and most populous city is San Juan . The territory does not observe daylight saving time , and its official languages are Spanish , which is predominant , and English . The island 's population is approximately 3.5 million . Puerto Rico 's rich history , tropical climate , diverse natural scenery , renowned traditional cuisine , and attractive tax incentives make it a popular destination for travelers from around the world .   Originally populated by the aboriginal Taíno people , the island was claimed in 1493 by Christopher Columbus for the Kingdom of Spain , enduring several invasion attempts by the French , Dutch , and British . During the four centuries of Spanish rule , the island 's ethnic , cultural and physical landscapes were transformed , as the island was settled overwhelmingly by Spanish settlers , primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , continuing right up until the end of the 19th century , as a result of which it is overwhelmingly Catholic and markedly Hispanic territory in terms of culture and language . In 1898 , following the Spanish–American War , the United States annexed the island under the terms of the Treaty of Paris .   Puerto Ricans are natural-born citizens of the United States . Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the United States Congress , which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950 . As a U.S. territory , American citizens residing on the island are `` disenfranchised at the national level '' and may not vote for president and vice president of the United States . However , Congress approved a local constitution , allowing U.S. citizens on the territory to elect a governor .   A 2012 referendum showed a majority ( 54 % of the electorate ) disagreed with `` the present form of territorial status , '' with full statehood as the preferred option among those who voted for a change of status . However , 470,000 voters left the second question blank , leading statehood opponents to suggest that the referendum actually revealed only 45 % support for statehood . Following the vote , the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution to request the president and Congress of the United States to end its current status as an unincorporated U.S. territory and begin the process of admission to the union as a state .   Etymology   Puerto Ricans often call the island Borinquen – a derivation of Borikén , its indigenous Taíno name , which means `` Land of the Valiant Lord . '' The terms boricua and borincano derive from Borikén and Borinquen respectively , and are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage . The island is also popularly known in Spanish as la isla del encanto , meaning `` the island of enchantment . ''   Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista , in honor of Saint John the Baptist , while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico ( ) . Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico , while San Juan became the name used for the main trading/shipping port and the capital city .   The island 's name was briefly changed to `` Porto Rico '' by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898 . The anglicized name was used by the US government and private enterprises . The name was finally changed back to Puerto Rico by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by Félix Córdova Dávila in 1931 .   History   Pre-Columbian era   The ancient history of the archipelago known today as Puerto Rico is not well known . Unlike other larger , more advanced indigenous communities in the New World ( Aztec and Inca ) whose people left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies , the indigenous population of Puerto Rico left scant artifacts and evidence . The scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish scholarly accounts from the colonial era constitute the basis of knowledge about them . The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was"], [234, "The Triassic is a geologic period and system that extends from to million years ago , an interval of 50.87 million years . It is the first period of the Mesozoic Era , and lies between the Permian and Jurassic periods . Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events . The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti , after the three distinct rock layers ( tri meaning `` three '' ) that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europe—red beds , capped by marine limestone , followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstones—called the `` Trias '' .Friedrich von Alberti , Beitrag zu einer Monographie des bunten Sandsteins , Muschelkalks und Keupers , und die Verbindung dieser Gebilde zu einer Formation [ Contribution to a monograph on the colored sandstone , shell limestone and mudstone , and the joining of these structures into one formation ] ( Stuttgart and Tübingen , ( Germany ) : J.

Alberti coined the term `` Trias '' on [ https : //books.google.com/books ? id1ClSAAAAcAAJ & pg  PA324 # vonepage & q & f  false page 324 ] : '' … bunter Sandstein , Muschelkalk und Keuper das Resultat einer Periode , ihre Versteinerungen , um mich der Worte E. de Beaumont ’ s zu bedeinen , die Thermometer einer geologischen Epoche seyen , … also die bis jezt beobachtete Trennung dieser Gebilde in 3 Formationen nicht angemessen , und es mehr dem Begriffe Formation entsprechend sey , sie zu einer Formation , welche ich vorläufig Trias nennen will , zu verbinden . `` ( … colored sandstone , shell limestone , and mudstone are the result of a period ; their fossils are , to avail myself of the words of E. de Beaumont , the thermometer of a geologic epoch ; … thus the separation of these structures into 3 formations , which has been maintained until now , is n't appropriate , and it is more consistent with the concept of `` formation '' to join them into one formation , which for now I will name `` trias '' . )   The Triassic began in the wake of the Permian–Triassic extinction event , which left the Earth 's biosphere impoverished ; it would take well into the middle of the period for life to recover its former diversity . Therapsids and archosaurs were the chief terrestrial vertebrates during this time . A specialized subgroup of archosaurs , dinosaurs , first appeared in the Late Triassic but did not become dominant until the succeeding Jurassic . The first true mammals , themselves a specialized subgroup of Therapsids also evolved during this period , as well as the first flying vertebrates , the pterosaurs , who like the dinosaurs were a specialized subgroup of archosaurs . The vast supercontinent of Pangaea existed until the mid-Triassic , after which it began to gradually rift into two separate landmasses , Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south . The global climate during the Triassic was mostly hot and dry , [ http : //news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121018-triassic-extinctions-hot-global-warming-science-environment/ `` Lethally Hot '' Earth Was Devoid of Life—Could It Happen Again ? ] with deserts spanning much of Pangaea 's interior . However , the climate shifted and became more humid as Pangaea began to drift apart . The end of the period was marked by yet another major mass extinction , the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event , wiping out many groups and allowing dinosaurs to assume dominance in the Jurassic .   Dating and subdivisions   The Triassic is usually separated into Early , Middle , and Late Triassic Epochs , and the corresponding rocks are referred to as Lower , Middle , or Upper Triassic . The faunal stages from the youngest to oldest are :   Paleogeography   During the Triassic , almost all the Earth 's land mass was concentrated into a single supercontinent centered more or less on the equator , called Pangaea ( `` all the land '' ) . From the east a vast gulf entered Pangaea , the Tethys sea . It opened farther westward in the mid-Triassic , at the expense of the shrinking Paleo-Tethys Ocean , an ocean that existed during the Paleozoic . The remaining shores were surrounded by the world-ocean known as Panthalassa ( `` all the sea '' ) . All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through subduction of oceanic plates ; thus , very little is known of the Triassic open ocean .  The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic—especially late in the period—but had not yet separated . The first nonmarine"], [235, "Spider is a type of Patience game . It is one of the more popular two-deck solitaire games .   The game   The main purpose of the game is to remove all cards from the table , assembling them in the tableau before removing them . Initially , 54 cards are dealt to the tableau in ten piles , face down except for the top cards . The tableau piles build down by rank , and in-suit sequences can be moved together . The 50 remaining cards can be dealt to the tableau ten at a time when none of the piles are empty .   Variants   * Gigantic Spider : Four decks  * Relaxed Spider : Does not require all spaces to be filled before redealing  * Spiderette : Only one pack , Klondike layout ; see below  * Spiderwort : Three decks  * Will o ' the Wisp is another solitaire card game which was invented by Geoffrey Mott-Smith and is played the same way as Spiderette . The exception is that on the onset , twenty-one cards are dealt into seven columns of three with only the top card of each column face-up .   Software implementations   Common software versions of Spider are included with versions of Microsoft Windows Windows 7 , Vista , ME and XP as Spider Solitaire . Spider Solitaire was introduced in the Microsoft Plus ! 98 addition pack for Windows 98 . There are 104 cards , enough to make 8 decks . The game comes in three versions : Easy ( with 8 Spade packs ) , Medium ( with four packs each of Spades and Hearts ) , and Hard ( with two each of all four packs ) .   An earlier version was written for Windows 3.x in 1991 by John A. Junod , the original developer of WS_FTP . The final version was Windows Spider Solitaire version 92.01.04 . He also wrote a DOS version called EGA-Spider with version up to 93.07.05 . A similar game called Arachnid , was also written for Windows 3.x in 1991 by Ian Heath , a computer science professor at the University of Southampton in the UK . The latest known version is 1.2 and is quite well polished . This game was also re-written for 32-bit operating systems and is referred to as Arachnid 32 .   On Unix operating systems , an early version was developed around 1989 at Sun Microsystems . A version of Spider Solitaire typically comes bundled with both the KDE and GNOME desktop environments on other Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and BSD , under the names KPatience and AisleRiot Solitaire , respectively . Versions for Macintosh and most other operating systems are also available .   The newer Windows versions offer three levels of difficulty , with one , two , or four suits . These play modes are equivalent to disregarding suit difference , either within the colors or altogether , and thus can be simulated in the physical card game , though the computer version aids visibility by representing all cards as spades and/or hearts .   Scoring   Different software implementations of spider offer alternative scoring rules . The version from Sun Microsystems from 1989 defines the following rules in the manual : 10 points for each initially face down card that gets turned over ; 15 additional points for each column where all the face-down cards have been turned over ( even if you do n't manage to get a space ) ; 2 points for each card that is sitting atop the next higher card of the same suit ; 50 points for each completed suit removed from the tableau ( in which case you do not also score for the 12 cards sitting atop next higher cards ) . This yields a maximum score of 990 . If you win the game with 4 or more completed suits still in the tableau , add 2 points for each suit after the first three . Thus winning with all eight suits still in the tableau yields a score of 1000 .   In the Windows versions of Spider Solitaire , the scoring is calculated with a starting score of 500 . One point is subtracted for each move ; 100 points are added for each set removed . This gives a theoretical maximum of 1254 points ( assuming all 50 cards from the decks are dealt exactly into place ) . A bonus of 100 points is gained for completing 4 sets of the same colour ."], [236, "The date of the start of the history of the United States is a subject of debate among historians . Older textbooks start with the arrival of Christopher Columbus on October 12 , 1492 and emphasize the European background , or they start around 1600 and emphasize the American frontier . In recent decades American schools and universities typically have shifted back in time to include more on the colonial period and much more on the prehistory of the Native peoples .   Indigenous people lived in what is now the United States for thousands of years before European colonists began to arrive , mostly from England , after 1600 . The Spanish had small settlements in Florida and the Southwest , and the French along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast . By the 1770s , thirteen British colonies contained two and a half million people along the Atlantic coast east of the Appalachian Mountains . In the 1760s , the British government imposed a series of new taxes while rejecting the American argument that any new taxes had to be approved by the people ( see Stamp Act 1765 ) . Tax resistance , especially the Boston Tea Party ( 1774 ) , led to punitive laws ( the Intolerable Acts ) by Parliament designed to end self-government in Massachusetts . American Patriots ( as they called themselves ) adhered to a political ideology called republicanism that emphasized civic duty , virtue , and opposition to corruption , fancy luxuries and aristocracy .   All thirteen colonies united in a Congress that called on them to write new state constitutions . After armed conflict began in Massachusetts , Patriots drove the royal officials out of every colony and assembled in mass meetings and conventions . Those Patriot governments in the colonies unanimously empowered their delegates to Congress to declare independence . In 1776 , Congress declared that there was a new , independent nation , the United States of America , not just a collection of disparate colonies . With large-scale military and financial support from France and military leadership by General George Washington , the American Patriots rebelled against British rule and succeeded in the Revolutionary War .   The peace treaty of 1783 gave the new nation the land east of the Mississippi River ( except Florida and Canada , and Spain disputed the Mississippi Territory until 1795 ) and confirmed Great Britain 's recognition of the United States as a nation . The central government established by the Articles of Confederation proved ineffectual at providing stability , as it had no authority to collect taxes and had no executive officer . Congress called a convention to meet secretly in Philadelphia in 1787 to revise the Articles of Confederation . It wrote a new Constitution , which was adopted in 1789 . In 1791 , a Bill of Rights was added to guarantee inalienable rights . With Washington as the Union 's first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief political and financial adviser , a strong central government was created . When Thomas Jefferson became president he purchased the Louisiana Territory from France , doubling the size of the United States . A second and final war with Britain was fought in 1812 .   Encouraged by the notion of Manifest Destiny , federal territory expanded all the way to the Pacific . The U.S. always was large in terms of area , but its population was small , only 4 million in 1790 . Population growth was rapid , reaching 7.2 million in 1810 , 32 million in 1860 , 76 million in 1900 , 132 million in 1940 , and 321 million in 2015 . Economic growth in terms of overall GDP was even faster . However the nation 's military strength was quite limited in peacetime before 1940 . The expansion was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for yeoman farmers and slave owners . The expansion of slavery was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles , which were resolved by compromises . Slavery was abolished in all states north of the Mason–Dixon line by 1804 , but the South continued to profit off the institution , producing high-value cotton exports to feed increasing high demand in Europe . The 1860 presidential election of Republican Abraham Lincoln was on a platform of ending the expansion of slavery and putting it on a path to extinction .   Seven cotton-based deep South slave states seceded and later founded the Confederacy months before Lincoln 's inauguration . No nation ever recognized the Confederacy , but it opened the war by attacking Fort Sumter in 1861 . A surge of nationalist outrage in the North fueled a"], [237, "Italy ( ) , officially the Italian Republic ( ) , is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.The Italian peninsula is geographically located in Southern Europe , while North Italy can be placed partly or totally in Central Europe . Due to cultural , political and historical reasons , Italy is a Western European country . Italy covers an area of 301338 km2 and has a largely temperate seasonal climate or Mediterranean climate ; due to its shape , it is often referred to in Italy as lo Stivale ( the Boot ) . With 61 million inhabitants , it is the third most populous EU member state . Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea , Italy shares open land borders with France , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , San Marino and Vatican City .   Since classical times , ancient Phoenicians and Greeks , Etruscans , and Celts have inhabited the south , centre and north of the Italian Peninsula respectively , with various Italic peoples dispersed throughout Italy alongside other ancient Italian tribes and Greek , Carthaginian , and Phoenician colonies . The Italic tribe known as the Latins formed the Roman Kingdom , which eventually spread throughout Italy , assimilating and conquering other nearby civilizations and forming the Roman Republic . Rome ultimately emerged as the dominant power , conquering much of the ancient world and becoming the leading cultural , political , and religious centre of Western civilisation . The legacy of the Roman Empire is widespread and can be observed in the global distribution of civilian law , republican governments , Christianity and the Latin script .   During the Middle Ages , Italy suffered sociopolitical collapse amid calamitous barbarian invasions , but by the 11th century , numerous rival city-states and maritime republics rose to great prosperity through shipping , commerce , and banking , and even laid the groundwork for capitalism . These independent city-states and regional republics , acting as Europe 's main port of entry for Asian and Near Eastern imported goods , often enjoyed a greater degree of democracy in comparison to the monarchies and feudal states found throughout Europe at the time , though much of central Italy remained under the control of the theocratic Papal States , while Southern Italy remained largely feudal , partially as a result of a succession of Byzantine , Arab , Norman , Spanish , and Bourbon conquests of the region .   The Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe , bringing a renewed interest in humanism , science , exploration , and art with the start of the modern era . Italian culture flourished at this time , producing famous scholars , artists , and polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci , Galileo , Michelangelo , and Machiavelli . Explorers from Italy such as Marco Polo , Christopher Columbus , Amerigo Vespucci , and Giovanni da Verrazzano discovered new routes to the Far East and the New World , helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery . Nevertheless , Italy 's importance as a hub of commercial and political power significantly waned with the opening of trade routes from the New World , as New World imports and trade routes became more influential in Europe and bypassed the East Asian and Mediterranean trade routes that the Italian city-states had dominated . Furthermore , the Italian city-states constantly engaged one another in bloody warfare , with this tension and violent rivalry culminating in the Italian Wars of the 15th and 16th centuries , a series of wars and foreign invasions that left the Italian states vulnerable to annexation by neighboring European powers . Italy would remain politically fragmented and fall prey to conquest , occupation , and general foreign domination by European powers such as France , Spain , and Austria , subsequently entering a long period of decline .   By the mid-19th century , a rising movement in support of Italian nationalism and Italian independence from foreign control lead to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the Risorgimento , which sought to bring about a rebirth of Italian cultural and economic prominence by liberating and consolidating the Italian peninsula and insular Italy into an independent and unified nation-state . After various unsuccessful attempts , the Italian Wars of Independence , the Expedition of the Thousand and the capture of Rome resulted in the eventual unification of the country , now a great power after centuries of foreign domination and political division . From the late 19th century to the early 20th century , the new Kingdom of Italy rapidly industrialized , especially in the so-called Industrial Triangle of Milan , Turin and Genoa in the"], [238, "Dame Jennifer Mary `` Jenny '' Shipley ( née Robson , born 4 February 1952 ) was the 36th Prime Minister of New Zealand from December 1997 to December 1999 , the first woman to hold this office and to date the only female leader of the New Zealand National Party .   Early life   Born in Gore , New Zealand , Shipley was one of four sisters . After attending Marlborough Girls ' College , she qualified in 1971 as a teacher and taught in New Zealand primary schools until 1976 . In 1973 she married Burton Shipley and settled in Ashburton . She assisted in a number of educational and child-care organisations , such as the Plunket Society .   Member of Parliament   Having joined the National Party in 1975 , Shipley successfully stood in Ashburton , a safe National seat in the country areas surrounding Christchurch , in the 1987 election . Entering parliament at age 35 , she was one of parliament 's youngest members . She represented this electorate until her retirement from politics in 2002 , though it was renamed Rakaia in 1990 .   Cabinet Minister   Shipley rose quickly in the National caucus . While still in her second term , party leader Jim Bolger named her the party 's spokeswoman on social welfare . When Bolger led the National Party to victory in the general election of 1990 , Shipley became Minister of Social Welfare , and also served as Minister for Women 's Affairs ( 1990–1996 ) .   In her role as Minister of Social Welfare , Shipley presided over sharp cutbacks to state benefits . Later , when she became Minister of Health in 1993 , she caused further controversy by attempting to reform the public health service , introducing an internal market . When National gained re-election in 1996 , Shipley left the Women 's Affairs portfolio and took on several others , including responsibility for state-owned enterprises and transport .   Prime Minister   Shipley grew increasingly frustrated and disillusioned with the cautious pace of National 's leader , Jim Bolger , and with what she saw as the disproportionate influence of coalition partner New Zealand First . She began gathering support to replace Bolger in mid-1997 . Later that year , while Bolger attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting , Shipley convinced a majority of her National Party colleagues to back her bid for the leadership . Bolger , seeing that he no longer had the support of his party , resigned , and Shipley replaced him . As leader of the governing party , she became Prime Minister on 8 December 1997 .   Despite continued economic growth , the Shipley government became increasingly politically unstable . In particular , the relationship between National and New Zealand First deteriorated . While Bolger had been able to maintain good relations with New Zealand First and with its leader , Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters , the alliance became strained after Shipley rose to power . Finally , on 14 August 1998 , Shipley sacked Peters from Cabinet .   Peters immediately withdrew support for Shipley 's government . However , several New Zealand First MPs wanted to continue the coalition , and led by NZF deputy leader Tau Henare they tried to oust Peters as leader . When they failed , they left their party , either becoming independents or trying to form their own parties . Shipley gained sufficient support from these MPs to keep National in power . On the same day Shipley unexpectedly backed Cultural Affairs Minister Marie Hasler 's call for a change in the New Zealand flag .   Shipley , along with the New Zealand Tourism Board , backed the quasi-national emblem of the silver fern on a black background as a possible alternative flag , along the lines of the Canadian flag , but she took pains to publicly disassociate herself from Bolger 's support for republicanism . As the debate continued in 1999 , the Princess Royal visited New Zealand , and Shipley stated , `` I am an unashamed royal supporter , along with many New Zealanders . '' However , the debate was muted by the controversy surrounding Tourism Board contracts going to the public-relations firm Saatchi & Saatchi , whose World CEO Kevin Roberts , also an advocate of the silver fern flag , was a good friend of Shipley .   She was the first Prime Minister to attend the gay and lesbian Hero Parade , being the first National Party leader to seek to make electoral overtures to the gay and lesbian voting public .

He was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the decade and one of its best-selling artists . By 1974 , he was firmly established as America 's best-selling performer , and AllMusic has described Denver as `` among the most beloved entertainers of his era '' . After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family , Denver began his music career in folk music groups in the late 1960s . Throughout his life , Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs , about 200 of which he composed , with total sales of over 33 million .   He recorded and performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature , his enthusiasm for music , and his relationship trials . Denver 's music appeared on a variety of charts , including country and western , the Billboard Hot 100 , and adult contemporary , in all earning him twelve gold and four platinum albums with his signature songs `` Take Me Home , Country Roads '' , `` Annie 's Song '' , `` Rocky Mountain High '' , `` Thank God I 'm a Country Boy '' , and `` Sunshine on My Shoulders '' .   Denver further starred in films and several notable television specials in the 1970s and 1980s . In the following decade , he continued to record , but also focused on calling attention to environmental issues , lent his vocal support to space exploration , and testified in front of Congress to protest against censorship in music . He was known for his love of the state of Colorado , which he sang about numerous times . He lived in Aspen , Colorado , for much of his life . He was named Poet Laureate of the state in 1974 . The Colorado state legislature also adopted `` Rocky Mountain High '' as one of its state songs in 2007 . Denver was an avid pilot and died in a single-fatality crash of his personal experimental aircraft at the age of 53 .   Biography   Early years   Henry John Deutschendorf , Jr. , was born in Roswell , New Mexico , to Lt. Col. Henry John Deutschendorf , Sr. , an Air Force officer ( who set three speed records in the B-58 Hustler bomber and earned a place in the Air Force Hall of Fame ) and Erma Louise Swope . Henry Sr. was of German ancestry , and met and married his `` Oklahoma Sweetheart '' . Denver 's Irish Catholic and German maternal grandmother was the one who imbued Denver with his love of music . In his autobiography , Take Me Home , Denver described his life as the eldest son of a family shaped by a stern father who could not show his love for his children . He is also the nephew of singer Dave Deutschendorf of The New Christy Minstrels .   Because Denver 's father was in the military , the family moved often , making it difficult for Denver to make friends and fit in with other children of his own age . Constantly being the new kid was troubling for the introverted Denver , and he grew up always feeling like he should be somewhere else , but never knowing where that `` right '' place was . While living in Tucson , Arizona , Denver was a member of the Tucson Arizona Boys Chorus for two years . Denver was happy living in Tucson , but his father was transferred to Montgomery , Alabama , then in the midst of the Montgomery boycotts . The family later moved to Fort Worth , Texas , where Denver graduated from Arlington Heights High School . Attending high school in Fort Worth was a distressing experience for the disenfranchised Denver . In his third year of high school , he borrowed his father 's car and ran away to California to visit family friends and begin his music career . His father flew to California in a friend 's jet to retrieve him and Denver reluctantly returned to finish high school .   At the age of 11 , Denver received an acoustic guitar from his grandmother . He learned to play well enough to perform at local clubs by the time he was in college . He adopted the surname `` Denver ''"], [240, "Mermaids is a 1990 American comedy-drama film directed by Richard Benjamin and starring Cher , Bob Hoskins , Winona Ryder ( who was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actress for her role ) , and Christina Ricci in her first film role . It is based on the 1986 novel of the same title written by Patty Dann . It was shot in and around the town of Ipswich , Massachusetts and Pawtucket , Rhode Island .   Plot   The film is narrated by Charlotte Flax , a 15-year-old girl living in Oklahoma with her glamorous but eccentric mother , Rachel ( whom she calls `` Mrs. Flax '' ) , and 9-year-old sister , Kate , who calls her by her given name . The narration begins in early fall 1963 , just as Rachel 's latest fling with her married employer ends and she decides to relocate once again . This time , they move to a new home near a convent in the small town of Eastport , Massachusetts . Charlotte has an obsession with Catholicism and idolizes the nuns living in the convent . She is always reminded by Rachel that they are Jewish . Kate , on the other hand , loves oceans and swimming . She apparently learned to do so when she was a baby , allowing her to win many competitions .   In Eastport , Charlotte becomes especially interested in Joe , the 26-year-old handsome caretaker of the convent and local school bus driver while Rachel falls in love with a local shop owner named Lou Landsky . After the assassination of John F. Kennedy , Charlotte comforts Joe in mourning and they end up kissing in the bell tower where he rings the church bell . After the encounter , she begins fasting in order to purge her sinful thoughts . Soon fearing that God may be punishing her by making her pregnant ( and unable to talk to her mother about it ) , she steals Rachel 's car and runs away . She stops at the house of a `` nuclear perfect family '' in Connecticut asking to spend the night , tells them her name is Sal Val , and other wild stories ( which they do n't seem to completely believe ) . Later on , she is picked up by Lou and taken home . Upon returning home , Charlotte receives a harsh scolding from Rachel who calms down after drinking Scotch liquor and tells Charlotte that she was worried sick about her safety and , thinking that it 's her fault that Charlotte ran away from home , admits that even though she 's not an expert in her parenting , she 's willing to compromise and try her best to take care of both Charlotte and Kate . The next day , Charlotte makes an appointment at the nearest hospital , where she goes to see an obstetrician and is told she is still a virgin . Relieved , she goes home , dispelled of her assumption that `` one kiss can get you pregnant '' .   At a New Year 's costume party , Lou asks Rachel to move in with him but she declines , reminding him that they 're still married to different spouses and not willing to break up with him nor let their relationship progress , and they have a big fight . Rachel then asks Joe for a ride home after which she wishes him a happy new year and kisses him . Charlotte sees this and feels that her mother is trying to steal him away . The night after the incident , Charlotte dresses up in Rachel 's clothes and makeup and she and Kate get drunk on wine . She then takes her to the convent to see Joe . Kate decides to stay behind and collect rocks while Charlotte goes up to the bell tower to find Joe and ends up losing her virginity to him . Unbeknownst to them , Kate falls into a river and almost drowns , but is saved by the nuns . Rachel is very angry at the turn of events and she and Charlotte have a big fight , later deciding to move again to avoid embarrassment as the whole town is talking about Charlotte and Joe . However , Charlotte convinces her to stay there at least for another year .   Rachel stays behind and her relationship with Lou progresses . Joe moves to California but keeps in touch with Charlotte via postcards , while she gains a reputation in high school and takes Greek myths as her new passion ( even though Rachel"], [241, "Julia Eileen Gillard ( born 29 September 1961 ) is a former Australian politician who served as the 27th Prime Minister of Australia from 2010 to 2013 , as leader of the Australian Labor Party . She previously served as the 13th Deputy Prime Minister of Australia , and held the cabinet positions of Minister for Education , Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion from 2007 to 2010 . She was the first and to date only woman to hold the positions of deputy prime minister , prime minister and leader of a major party in Australia .   Born in Barry , Wales , Gillard migrated with her family to Adelaide , South Australia , in 1966 . She attended Mitcham Demonstration School and Unley High School . Subsequently , Gillard studied at the University of Adelaide , but cut short her courses to move to Melbourne , Victoria , in 1982 , where she worked with the Australian Union of Students and served as the organisation 's president from 1983 to 1984 . Gillard later graduated from the University of Melbourne , with a Bachelor of Laws degree ( 1986 ) and a Bachelor of Arts degree ( 1989 ) . In 1987 , she joined the law firm Slater & Gordon and became a partner in 1990 , specialising in industrial law . A departure from the law firm in 1996 saw Gillard serve as chief of staff to the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria John Brumby , which preceded her own entry into federal politics .   Gillard was first elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election for the seat of Lalor . Following the 2001 federal election , she was elected to the Shadow Cabinet and was given the portfolio of Population and Immigration . In 2003 , she took on the responsibility for both Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs and Health . In December 2006 , when Kevin Rudd was elected as Labor Leader and became Leader of the Opposition , Gillard was elected unopposed as his deputy . Upon Labor 's victory in the 2007 federal election , Gillard became the first female Deputy Prime Minister of Australia , and held the cabinet portfolios of Minister for Education , Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion . On , after Rudd lost the support of his party and resigned , Gillard was elected unopposed as the Leader of the Labor Party , thus becoming the 27th Prime Minister of Australia . The subsequent 2010 federal election saw the first hung parliament since the 1940 federal election . Gillard was able to form a minority government with the support of a Green MP and three independent MPs . On 26 June 2013 , after a leadership spill , Gillard lost the leadership of the Labor Party to Rudd . Her resignation as Prime Minister took effect the following day . Gillard retired from politics on 5 August 2013 , before the impending federal election .   Following her departure from politics , in August 2013 Gillard became an honorary visiting professor at the University of Adelaide , and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution 's Center for Universal Education in October . Gillard released her political memoirs , My Story , in September 2014 . She has been on the board of mental health organisation beyondblue from December 2014 , and was made an honorary fellow of Aberystwyth University in June 2015 . In addition to her various appointments , Gillard has served as the chairwoman of the Global Partnership for Education since February 2014 .   Early life and family   Gillard was born on 29 September 1961 , in Barry , Wales . After she suffered from bronchopneumonia as a child , her parents were advised it would aid her recovery if they were to live in a warmer climate . This led the family to migrate to Australia in 1966 , settling in Adelaide . In 1974 , eight years after they arrived , Gillard and her family became Australian citizens . As a result , Gillard held dual Australian/British citizenship until she renounced her British citizenship prior to entering Parliament in 1998 . Her father , John Oliver Gillard ( 1929–2012 ) , was of English , Irish and Welsh descent , and worked as a psychiatric nurse . Gillard 's mother , Moira Gillard ( née Mackenzie ) , worked at the local Salvation Army nursing home and currently lives in Pasadena , South Australia . Moira 's ancestry is Scottish and Irish . Gillard also has a sister , Alison , who is three years older .   Education"], [242, "The Lake District , also known as The Lakes or Lakeland , is a mountainous region in North-West England . A popular holiday destination , it is famous for its lakes , forests and mountains ( or fells ) and its associations with the early 19th century writings of William Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets .   Historically split between Cumberland , Westmorland and Lancashire , the Lake District is now entirely in Cumbria . All the land in England higher than 3000 ft above sea level lies within the National Park , including Scafell Pike , the highest mountain in England . It also contains the deepest and longest bodies of water in England , respectively Wastwater and Windermere .   Lake District National Park   The Lake District National Park includes nearly all of the Lake District , though the town of Kendal and the Lakeland Peninsulas are currently outside the park boundary .   The area , which was designated a national park on 9 May 1951 ( less than a month after the first UK national park designation — the Peak District ) , is the most visited national park in the United Kingdom with 15.8 million annual visitors and more than 23 million annual day visits , the largest of the thirteen national parks in England and Wales , and the second largest in the UK after the Cairngorms . Its aim is to protect the landscape by restricting unwelcome change by industry or commerce . Most of the land in the park is in private ownership , with about 55 % registered as agricultural land . Landowners include :  * Individual farmers and other private landowners , with more than half of the agricultural land farmed by the owners .  * The National Trust owns about a quarter of the total area ( including some lakes and land of significant landscape value ) .  * The Forestry Commission and other investors in forests and woodland .  * United Utilities owns 8 %  * Lake District National Park Authority ( 3.9 % ) The National Park Authority is based at offices in Kendal . It runs a visitor centre on Windermere at a former country house called Brockhole , Coniston Boating Centre , and Information Centres . It is reducing its landholding .   In common with all other national parks in England , there is no restriction on entry to , or movement within the park along public routes , but access to cultivated land is usually restricted to public footpaths , bridleways and byways . Much of the uncultivated land has statutory open access rights - which cover around 50 % of the park .   The lakes and mountains combine to form impressive scenery . Farmland and settlement add aesthetic value to the natural scenery with an ecology modified by human influence for millennia and including important wildlife habitats . The Lake District failed in a previous attempt to gain World Heritage status as a natural World Heritage Site , because of human activities , such as commercial forestry , which have adversely impacted the park 's assessment . However , in 2016 the [ http : //www.lakesworldheritage.co.uk English Lake District bid ] for World Heritage Status was submitted to UNESCO in the category of cultural landscape . A decision is expected in 2017 .   Extension to the National Park   In December 2009 , Natural England proposed extending the National Park in the direction of the Yorkshire Dales National Park . This would include land of high landscape value in the Lune Valley . The proposal was opposed by Cumbria County Council who said it would lead to less democratic control and would make local housing less affordable . A public inquiry was held into the proposals , which required a decision by the Secretary of State . The decision to recommend approval was announced on October 23 , 2015 , and the size of the park increased by 3 % on 1 August 2016 .   Human geography   General   The precise extent of the Lake District was not defined traditionally , but is slightly larger than that of the National Park , the total area of which is about 885 sqmi . The park extends just over 32 mi from east to west and nearly 40 mi from north to south , with areas such as the Lake District Peninsulas to the south lying outside the National Park .   Settlement   The Lake District is one of the most highly populated national parks . There are , however , only a handful of major settlements within this"], [243, "The Philippines ( ; ) , officially the Republic of the Philippines ( ) , is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia situated in the western Pacific Ocean . It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south : Luzon , Visayas , and Mindanao . The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City , both part of Metro Manila .   The Philippines ' location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons , but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world 's greatest biodiversity . The Philippines has an area of approximately 300000 km2 , and a population of more than 100 million with faster growth than any other east Asian country . It is the seventh-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world . An additional 12 million Filipinos live overseas , comprising one of the world 's largest diasporas . Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands . In prehistoric times , Negritos were some of the archipelago 's earliest inhabitants . They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples . Exchanges with Chinese , Malay , Indian , and Islamic states occurred . Then , various nations were established under the rule of Datus , Rajahs , Sultans or Lakans .   The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in Homonhon , Eastern Samar in 1521 marked the beginning of Hispanic colonization . In 1543 , Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain . With the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi from Mexico City , in 1565 , the first Hispanic settlement in the archipelago was established . The Philippines became part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years . This resulted in Roman Catholicism becoming the dominant religion . During this time , Manila became the western hub of the trans-Pacific trade connecting Asia with Acapulco in the Americas using Manila galleons .   As the 19th century gave way to the 20th , there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution , which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic , followed by the bloody Philippine–American War of conquest by US military force . Aside from the period of Japanese occupation , the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II , when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation . Since then , the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy , which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution .   The nation 's large population and economic potential have led it to be classified as a middle power . It is a founding member of the United Nations , World Trade Organization , Association of Southeast Asian Nations , the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , and the East Asia Summit . It also hosts the headquarters of the Asian Development Bank . The Philippines is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country , which has an economy transitioning from being one based on agriculture to one based more on services and manufacturing . [ https : //www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html # Econ CIA World Factbook , Philippines ] , Retrieved May 15 , 2009 .   Etymology   The Philippines was named in honor of King Philip II of Spain . Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of Leyte and Samar Felipinas after the then Prince of Asturias . Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago . Before that became commonplace , other names such as Islas del Poniente ( Islands of the West ) and Magellan 's name for the islands San Lázaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands .   The official name of the Philippines has changed several times in the course of its history . During the Philippine Revolution , the Malolos Congress proclaimed the establishment of the República Filipina or the Philippine Republic . From the period of the Spanish–American War ( 1898 ) and the Philippine–American War ( 1899–1902 ) until the Commonwealth period ( 1935–46 ) , American colonial authorities referred to the country as the Philippine Islands , a translation of the Spanish name . From the 1898 Treaty of Paris , the name Philippines began to appear and it has since become the country 's common name . Since the end of World War"], [244, "Cheshire ( or ; archaically the County Palatine of Chester ; abbreviated Ches . ) is a county in North West England , bordering Merseyside and Greater Manchester to the north , Derbyshire to the east , Staffordshire and Shropshire to the south and Wales to the west ( bordering Wrexham and Flintshire ) . Cheshire 's county town is Chester ; the largest town is Warrington .   Other major towns include Congleton , Crewe , Ellesmere Port , Macclesfield , Northwich , Runcorn , Widnes , Wilmslow , and Winsford . The county covers 2343 km2 and has a population of around 1 million . It is mostly rural , with a number of small towns and villages supporting the agricultural and other industries which produce Cheshire cheese , salt , chemicals and silk .   History   Toponymy   Cheshire 's name was originally derived from an early name for Chester , and was first recorded as Legeceasterscir in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle , Harris , B. E. and Thacker , A. T. ( 1987 ) . p. 237. meaning the shire of the city of legions.Crosby , A . ( 1996 ) . page 31 . Although the name first appears in 980 , it is thought that the county was created by Edward the Elder around 920 . In the Domesday Book , Chester was recorded as having the name Cestrescir ( Chestershire ) , derived from the name for Chester at the time . A series of changes that occurred as English itself changed , together with some simplifications and elision , resulted in the name Cheshire , as it occurs today .   Because of the historically close links with the land bordering Cheshire to the west , which became modern Wales , there is a history of interaction between Cheshire and North Wales . The Domesday Book records Cheshire as having two complete Hundreds ( Atiscross and Exestan ) that later became the principal part of Flintshire . Additionally , another large portion of the Duddestan Hundred later became known as Maelor Saesneg when it was transferred to North Wales . For this and other reasons , the Welsh name for Cheshire ( Swydd Gaerlleon ) is sometimes used within Wales and by Welsh speakers .   Administrative history   After the Norman conquest of 1066 by William I , dissent and resistance continued for many years after the invasion . In 1069 local resistance in Cheshire was finally put down using draconian measures as part of the Harrying of the North . The ferocity of the campaign against the Saxon populace was enough to end all future resistance . Examples were made of major landowners such as Saxon Earl Edwin of Mercia , their properties confiscated and redistributed amongst Norman barons . William I made Cheshire a county palatine and gave Gerbod the Fleming the new title of Earl of Chester . When Gerbod returned to Normandy in about 1070 , the king used his absence to declare the earldom forfeit and gave the title to Hugh d'Avranches ( nicknamed Hugh Lupus , or `` wolf '' ) . Due to Cheshire 's strategic location on Welsh Marches , the Earl had complete autonomous powers to rule on behalf of the king in the county palatine .   Palatine hundreds   Cheshire in the Domesday Book ( 1086 ) is recorded as a much larger county than it is today . It included two hundreds , Atiscross and Exestan , that later became part of North Wales . At the time of the Domesday Book , it also included as part of Duddestan Hundred the area of land later known as English Maelor ( which used to be a detached part of Flintshire ) in Wales . The area between the Mersey and Ribble ( referred to in the Domesday Book as `` Inter Ripam et Mersam '' ) formed part of the returns for Cheshire . Sylvester ( 1980 ) . p. 14 . Although this has been interpreted to mean that at that time south Lancashire was part of Cheshire , more exhaustive research indicates that the boundary between Cheshire and what was to become Lancashire remained the River Mersey . With minor variations in spelling across sources , the complete list of hundreds of Cheshire at this time are : Atiscross , Bochelau , Chester , Dudestan , Exestan , Hamestan , Middlewich , Riseton , Roelau , Tunendune , Warmundestrou and Wilaveston .   Palatine feudal baronies   Feudal baronies or baronies by tenure were granted by the Earl as forms of feudal land tenure within the palatinate in a similar way to which the king granted"], [245, "The James Bond film series is a British series of spy films based on the fictional character of MI6 agent James Bond , `` 007 '' , who originally appeared in a series of books by Ian Fleming . It is one of the longest continually-running film series in history , having been in on-going production from 1962 to the present ( with a six-year hiatus between 1989 and 1995 ) . In that time Eon Productions has produced 24 films , most of them at Pinewood Studios . With a combined gross of over $ 7 billion to date , the films produced by Eon constitute the third-highest-grossing film series , behind the Harry Potter and Marvel Cinematic Universe films ( accounting for the effects of inflation the Bond films are the highest-grossing series amassing over $ 13 billion at 2011/2012 prices ) . Six actors have portrayed 007 in the Eon series , the latest being Daniel Craig .   Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman co-produced most of the Eon films until 1975 , when Broccoli became the sole producer . The single exception during this period was Thunderball , on which Broccoli and Saltzman became executive producers while Kevin McClory produced . From 1984 to 1989 Broccoli was joined by his stepson Michael G. Wilson as producer until 1995 , when Albert Broccoli stepped aside from Eon and was replaced by his daughter Barbara , who has co-produced with Wilson since . Broccoli 's ( and until 1975 , Saltzman 's ) family company , Danjaq , has held ownership of the series through Eon , and maintained co-ownership with United Artists since the mid-1970s . The Eon series has seen continuity both in the main actors and in the production crews , with directors , writers , composers , production designers , and others employed through a number of films .   From the release of Dr. No ( 1962 ) to For Your Eyes Only ( 1981 ) , the films were distributed solely by United Artists . When Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer absorbed United Artists in 1981 , MGM/UA Entertainment Co. was formed and distributed the films until 1995 . MGM solely distributed three films from 1997 to 2002 after United Artists was retired as a mainstream studio . From 2006 to present , MGM and Columbia Pictures have co-distributed the film series , following the 2005 acquisition of MGM by a consortium led by Columbia 's parent company , Sony Pictures Entertainment . In November 2010 ; MGM filed for bankruptcy ; following its emergence from insolvency , Columbia has been co-production partner of the series with Danjaq until Sony 's distribution rights to the franchise comes to the end with the release of Spectre .   Independently of the Eon series , there have been three additional productions with the character of James Bond : a 1954 American television adaptation , Casino Royale , produced by CBS ; a 1967 spoof , Casino Royale , produced by Charles K. Feldman ; and a 1983 remake of Thunderball entitled Never Say Never Again , produced by Jack Schwartzman , who had obtained the rights to the film from McClory .   Development   First screen adaptation   In 1954 the American CBS television network paid Ian Fleming $ 1,000 ( $ in dollars ) for the rights to turn his first novel , Casino Royale , into a one-hour television adventure as part of the dramatic anthology series Climax Mystery Theater , which ran between October 1954 and June 1958 . It was adapted for the screen by Anthony Ellis and Charles Bennett ; Bennett was well known for his collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock , including The 39 Steps and Sabotage . Due to the restriction of a one-hour play , the adapted version lost many of the details found in the book , although it retained its violence , particularly in Act III . The hour-long `` Casino Royale '' episode , which starred American actor Barry Nelson as Bond and Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre , aired on 21 October 1954 as a live production .   Eon Productions   Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman ( 1962–64 )   In 1959 producer Albert R. `` Cubby '' Broccoli at Warwick Films expressed interest in adapting the Bond novels , but his colleague Irving Allen was unenthusiastic . In June 1961 Fleming sold a six-month option on the film rights to his published and future James Bond novels and short stories to Harry Saltzman , with the exception of Casino Royale , which he had previously sold . Towards the end of Saltzman 's option period , screenwriter Wolf Mankowitz introduced him"], [246, "Amanda de Cadenet ( born 19 May 1972 ) is a British photographer , actress and talk show host .

The film was the first to be produced by Morgan Creek Productions . The film stars Emilio Estevez , Kiefer Sutherland , Lou Diamond Phillips , Charlie Sheen , Dermot Mulroney , Casey Siemaszko , Terence Stamp , Terry O'Quinn , Brian Keith , and Jack Palance .   Young Guns is a retelling of the adventures of Billy the Kid during the Lincoln County War , which took place in New Mexico during 1877–78 . It was filmed in and around New Mexico . Historian Dr. Paul Hutton called Young Guns the most historically accurate of all prior Billy the Kid films . It opened no . 1 at the box office , eventually earning $ 45 million from a moderate $ 11 million budget . A sequel , Young Guns II , was released in 1990 .   Plot   John Tunstall ( Terence Stamp ) , an educated Englishman and cattle rancher in Lincoln County , New Mexico , hires wayward young gunmen to live and work on his ranch . Tunstall is in heavy competition with a well-connected Irishman named Lawrence Murphy ( Jack Palance ) , who owns a large ranch ; their men clash on a regular basis . Tunstall recruits Billy ( Emilio Estevez ) and advises him to renounce violence saying that `` He who sows the wind will reap the whirlwind . '' Tensions escalate between the two camps , resulting in the murder of Tunstall . Billy , Doc Scurlock ( Kiefer Sutherland ) , Jose Chavez y Chavez ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) , Richard M. `` Dick '' Brewer ( Charlie Sheen ) , `` Dirty '' Steve Stephens ( Dermot Mulroney ) , and Charlie Bowdre ( Casey Siemaszko ) , consult their lawyer friend Alexander McSween ( Terry O'Quinn ) , who manages to get them deputized and given warrants for the arrest of Murphy 's murderous henchmen .   Billy quickly challenges Dick 's authority as leader , vowing revenge against Murphy and the men responsible for killing Tunstall . The men call themselves The Regulators and arrest some of the murderers , but hot-headed Billy is unable to wait for justice . He guns down unarmed men and goes on to kill one of his fellow Regulators ( later arrival J. McCloskey ) in the paranoid ( but correct ) belief that he was still in league with Murphy . The men are stripped of their badges , which they find out about by reading a newspaper . That same paper also confuses Dick for Billy , showing a picture of Dick labeled Billy the Kid , a nickname to which Billy takes an immediate liking .   While the local authorities begin their hunt for Billy and the boys , the Regulators argue about continuing with their warrants or to go on the run . One of the men on their list of warrants , Buckshot Roberts ( Brian Keith ) , tracks them down , barricades himself in an outhouse , and Dick dies in an intense shootout . Billy appoints himself as the new leader , the gang becomes famous and the U.S. Army is charged with bringing them to justice under Murphy 's corrupt political influence .   The gang eludes attention for some time , and Charlie gets married in Mexico . While attending the wedding , Billy meets Pat Garrett ( Patrick Wayne ) who is not yet a sheriff , but warns Billy of an attempt on Alex 's life by Murphy 's men that will happen the next day . Thus the gang packs up and heads off to save Alex .   Back in Lincoln , Murphy 's men , led by George W. Peppin , surround Alex 's house , trapping the Regulators , and a shootout begins . A ceasefire is called for the night . In the morning , accompanied by Murphy , the army comes in and torches the house , but Chavez escapes out the back . While the house is burning , the men come up with an escape plan . They begin throwing Alex 's possessions out the windows of the second floor . Billy places himself inside of a large trunk , and when it lands in front of the house , he leaps out and begins to open fire .

She remains the most awarded female country recording artist , including her being the only female ACM Artist of the Decade ( 1970s ) .   Early years   Lynn is the second of eight children born to homemaker Clara Marie `` Clary '' ( née Ramey ; May 5 , 1912November 24 , 1981 ) and coal miner Melvin Theodore `` Ted '' Webb ( October 24 , 1906February 23 , 1959 ) .

Path to stardom   In January 1948 , 15-year-old Loretta married Oliver `` Doolittle '' Lynn ( 1926–1996 ) . Their life together inspired the music she wrote .   In 1953 Doolittle bought her a $ 17 Harmony guitar . She taught herself to play . Over the following three years she worked to improve her guitar playing and with Doolittle 's encouragement started her own band , `` Loretta and the Trailblazers '' , with her brother , Jay Lee , playing lead guitar . She often appeared at Bill 's Tavern in Blaine , Washington , and the Delta Grange Hall in Custer , Washington , with the Pen Brothers ' band and The Westerneers .

Lynn focused on blue-collar women 's issues with themes about philandering husbands and persistent mistresses , inspired by issues she faced in her marriage . She pushed boundaries in the conservative genre of country music by singing about birth control ( `` The Pill '' ) , repeated childbirth ( `` One 's on the Way '' ) , double standards for men and women ( `` Rated `` X '' '' ) , and being widowed by the draft during the Vietnam War ( `` Dear Uncle Sam '' ) .

Piano sonatas are usually written in three or four movements , although some piano sonatas have been written with a single movement ( Scarlatti , Scriabin , Medtner ) , two movements ( Haydn ) , five ( Brahms ' Third Piano Sonata ) or even more movements . The first movement is generally composed in sonata form .   The Baroque keyboard sonata   In the Baroque era , the use of the term `` sonata '' generally referred to either the sonata da chiesa ( church sonata ) or sonata da camera ( chamber sonata ) , both of which were sonatas for various instruments ( usually one or more violins plus basso continuo ) . The keyboard sonata was relatively neglected by most composers .   The sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti ( of which there are over 500 ) were the hallmark of the Baroque keyboard sonata , though they were for the most part unpublished during Scarlatti 's lifetime . The majority of these sonatas are in one-movement binary form , both sections being in the same tempo and utilizing the same thematic material . These sonatas are prized for both their technical difficulty and their musical and formal ingenuity . The influence of Spanish folk music is evident in Scarlatti 's sonatas .   Other composers of keyboard sonatas ( which were primarily written in two or three movements ) include Marcello , Giustini , Durante and Platti .   Piano sonatas in the Classical era   Although various composers in the 17th century had written keyboard pieces which they entitled `` Sonata '' , it was only in the classical era , when the piano displaced the earlier harpsichord and sonata form rose to prominence as a principle of musical composition , that the term `` piano sonata '' acquired a definite meaning and a characteristic form .   All the well-known Classical era composers , especially Joseph Haydn , Muzio Clementi , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , and Ludwig van Beethoven , wrote many piano sonatas . Muzio Clementi wrote more than 110 piano sonatas . He is well known as `` The Father of the Pianoforte '' . Clementi 's Opus 2 was the first real piano sonata composed . The much younger Franz Schubert also wrote many .   The 32 sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven , including the well-known Pathétique Sonata and the Moonlight Sonata , are often considered the pinnacle of piano sonata composition .   Piano sonatas in the Romantic era   As the Romantic era progressed after Beethoven and Schubert , piano sonatas continued to be composed , but in lesser numbers as the form took on a somewhat academic tinge and competed with shorter genres more compatible with Romantic compositional style . Franz Liszt 's comprehensive `` three-movements-in-one '' Sonata in B minor draws on the concept of thematic transformation first introduced by Schubert in his Wanderer Fantasie of 1822 . Piano sonatas have been written throughout the 19th and 20th centuries and up to the present day .

He created some of the world 's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era .. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity .   Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms .   Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features . His plots were carefully constructed , and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives . Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them , opening up and inspiring a new class of readers .   Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age . His 1843 novella , A Christmas Carol , remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre . Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted , and , like many of his novels , evoke images of early Victorian London . His 1859 novel , A Tale of Two Cities , set in London and Paris , is his best-known work of historical fiction . Dickens 's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton—for its realism , comedy , prose style , unique characterisations , and social criticism . On the other hand , Oscar Wilde , Henry James , and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth , loose writing , and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism . The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings , such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters .   Early years   Charles John Huffam Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 , at 1 Mile End Terrace ( now 393 Commercial Road ) , Landport in Portsea Island ( Portsmouth ) , the second of eight children of John Dickens ( 1785–1851 ) and Elizabeth Dickens ( née Barrow ; 1789–1863 ) . His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district . He asked Christopher Huffam , rigger to His Majesty 's Navy , gentleman , and head of an established firm , to act as godfather to Charles . Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey , the owner of a shipping company in Dickens 's eponymous Dombey and Son ( 1848 ) .   In January 1815 John Dickens was called back to London , and the family moved to Norfolk Street , Fitzrovia . When Charles was four , they relocated to Sheerness , and thence to Chatham , Kent , where he spent his formative years until the age of 11 . His early life seems to have been idyllic , though he thought himself a `` very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy '' .   Charles spent time outdoors but also read voraciously , including the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding , as well as Robinson Crusoe and Gil Blas . He read and reread The Arabian Nights and the Collected Farces of Elizabeth Inchbald . He retained poignant memories of childhood , helped by an excellent memory of people and events , which he used in his writing .

The genre is considered a form of speculative fiction alongside science fiction films and horror films , although the genres do overlap . Fantasy films often have an element of magic , myth , wonder , escapism , and the extraordinary . [ http : //www.filmsite.org/fantasyfilms.html Fantasy Films ]   Subgenres   Several sub-categories of fantasy films can be identified , although the delineations between these subgenres , much as in fantasy literature , are somewhat fluid .   The most common fantasy subgenres depicted in movies are High Fantasy and Sword and Sorcery . Both categories typically employ quasi-medieval settings , wizards , magical creatures and other elements commonly associated with fantasy stories .   High Fantasy films tend to feature a more richly developed fantasy world , and may also be more character-oriented or thematically complex . Often , they feature a hero of humble origins and a clear distinction between good and evil set against each other in an epic struggle . Many scholars cite J. R. R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings novel as the prototypical modern example of High Fantasy in literature , and the recent Peter Jackson film adaptation of the books is a good example of the High Fantasy subgenre on the silver screen .   Sword and Sorcery movies tend to be more plot-driven than high fantasy and focus heavily on action sequences , often pitting a physically powerful but unsophisticated warrior against an evil wizard or other supernaturally endowed enemy . Although Sword and Sorcery films sometimes describe an epic battle between good and evil similar to those found in many High Fantasy movies , they may alternately present the hero as having more immediate motivations , such as the need to protect a vulnerable maiden or village , or even being driven by the desire for vengeance .   The 1982 film adaptation of Robert E. Howard 's Conan the Barbarian , for example , is a personal ( non-epic ) story concerning the hero 's quest for revenge and his efforts to thwart a single megalomaniac—while saving a beautiful princess in the process . Some critics refer to such films by the term Sword and Sandal rather than Sword and Sorcery , although others would maintain that the Sword and Sandal label should be reserved only for the subset of fantasy films set in ancient times on the planet Earth , and still others would broaden the term to encompass films that have no fantastic elements whatsoever . To some , the term Sword and Sandal has pejorative connotations , designating a film with a low-quality script , bad acting and poor production values .   Another important subgenre of fantasy films that has become more popular in recent years is contemporary fantasy . Such films feature magical effects or supernatural occurrences happening in the `` real '' world of today .   Films with live action and animation such as Disney 's Mary Poppins , Pete 's Dragon , Enchanted and the Robert Zemeckis film Who Framed Roger Rabbit are also fantasy films although are more often referred to as Live action/animation hybrids ( 2 of those are also classified as musicals ) .   Fantasy films set in the afterlife , called Bangsian Fantasy , are less common , although films such as the 1991 Albert Brooks comedy Defending Your Life would likely qualify . Other uncommon subgenres include Historical Fantasy and Romantic Fantasy , although 2003 's Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl successfully incorporated elements of both .   As noted above , superhero movies and fairy tale films might each be considered subgenres of fantasy films , although most would classify them as altogether separate movie genres .   Fantasy movies and the film industry   As a cinematic genre , fantasy has traditionally not been regarded as highly as the related genre of science fiction film . Undoubtedly , the fact that until recently fantasy films often suffered from the `` Sword and Sandal '' afflictions of inferior production values , over-the-top acting and decidedly poor special effects was a significant factor in fantasy film 's low regard .   Since the late 1990s , however , the genre has gained new respectability in a way , driven principally by the successful adaptations of J.R.R . Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings and J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter series . Jackson 's The Lord of the Rings trilogy is notable due to"], [252, "The Saxons ( , , , , , ) were a group of Germanic tribes first mentioned as living near the North Sea coast of what is now Germany ( Old Saxony ) , in late Roman times . They were soon mentioned as raiding and settling in many North Sea areas , as well as pushing south inland towards the Franks . Significant numbers settled in large parts of Great Britain in the early Middle Ages and formed part of the merged group of Anglo-Saxons who eventually organised the first united Kingdom of England . Many Saxons however remained in Germania , where they resisted the expanding Frankish Empire through the leadership of the semi-legendary Saxon hero , Widukind .   The Saxons ' earliest area of settlement is believed to have been Northern Albingia , an area approximately that of modern Holstein . This general area also included the probable homeland of the Angles . Saxons , along with the Angles and other continental Germanic tribes , participated in the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain during and after the 5th century . The British-Celtic inhabitants of the isles tended to refer to all these groups collectively as Saxons . It is unknown how many Saxons migrated from the continent to Britain , though estimates for the total number of Anglo-Saxon settlers are around 200,000 . During the Middle Ages , because of international Hanseatic trading routes and contingent migration , Saxons mixed with and had strong influences upon the languages and cultures of the Baltic peoples , Finnic peoples , and Polabian Slavs and Pomeranians , both West Slavic peoples , as well as influencing the North Germanic languages .   Etymology   The Saxons may have derived their name from seax , a kind of knife for which they were known . The seax has a lasting symbolic impact in the English counties of Essex and Middlesex , both of which feature three seaxes in their ceremonial emblem . Their names , along with those of Sussex and Wessex , contain a remnant of the word `` Saxon '' .   The Elizabethan era play Edmund Ironside suggests the Saxon name derives from the Latin saxa ( stone ) :   Saxon as a demonym   Celtic languages   In the Celtic languages , the words designating English nationality derive from the Latin word Saxones . The most prominent example , a loanword in English , is the Scottish Gaelic Sassenach ( Saxon ) , often used disparagingly in Scottish English/Scots . It derives from the Scottish Gaelic Sasunnach meaning , originally , `` Saxon '' , from the Latin `` Saxones '' . Scots- or Scottish English-speakers in the 21st century usually use it in jest , as a ( friendly ) term of abuse . The Oxford English Dictionary ( OED ) gives 1771 as the date of the earliest written use of the word in English .   Sasanach , the Irish word for an Englishman , has the same derivation , as do the words used in Welsh to describe the English people ( Saeson , sing . Sais ) and the language and things English in general : Saesneg and Seisnig .   Cornish terms the English Sawsnek , from the same derivation . In the 16th century Cornish-speakers used the phrase Meea navidna cowza sawzneck to feign ignorance of the English language .   `` England '' in Scottish Gaelic , is Sasainn ( Saxony ) . Other examples include the Welsh Saesneg ( the English language ) , Irish Sasana ( England ) , Breton saoz ( on ) ( English , saozneg `` the English language '' , Bro-saoz `` England '' ) , and Cornish Sowson ( English people ) , Sowsnek ( English language ) , and Pow Sows for 'Land [ Pays ] of Saxons ' .   Romance languages   The label `` Saxons '' ( in Romanian Saşi ) was also applied to German settlers who migrated during the 13th century to southeastern Transylvania . From Transylvania , some Saxons migrated to the neighbouring Moldavia , as the name of the town , Sas-cut , shows . Sascut is located in the part of Moldavia that is today part of Romania .   During Georg Friederich Händel 's visit to Italy , much was made of his being from Saxony ; in particular , the Venetians greeted the 1709 performance of his opera Agrippina with the cry Viva il caro Sassone , `` Cheers for the beloved Saxon !

She was one of the highest profile European actresses of the 1950s and early 1960s , a period in which she was an international sex symbol .   As her film career slowed , she established second careers as a photojournalist and sculptor . In the 1970s , she achieved a scoop by gaining access to Fidel Castro for an exclusive interview .   She has continued as an active supporter of Italian and Italian American causes , particularly the National Italian American Foundation ( NIAF ) . In 2008 , she received the NIAF Lifetime Achievement Award at the Foundation 's Anniversary Gala . In 2013 , she sold her jewelry collection , and donated the nearly $ 5 million from the sale to benefit stem cell therapy research .   Youth   Born Luigina Lollobrigida in Subiaco , Italy , she is one of four daughters of a furniture manufacturer and his wife . Her sisters are Giuliana ( b . 1924 ) , Maria ( b . 1929 ) and Fernanda ( 1930–2011 ) . In her youth , Lollobrigida did some modelling , and from that , she participated successfully in several beauty contests . At around this time , she began appearing in Italian films in minor roles .   In 1945 , at age 18 , she played a part in the comedy Santarellina by Eduardo Scarpetta at the Teatro della Concordia of Monte Castello di Vibio . ( It is the smallest theatre all'italiana in the world . )   In 1947 , Lollobrigida entered the Miss Italia pageant and came in third place , giving her national exposure .   Career   Cinema   In 1950 , Howard Hughes invited Lollobrigida to work in Hollywood , but she refused , preferring to remain in Europe ; this decision prevented her from working in American movies filmed in the USA until 1959 , though not from working in American productions shot in Europe . Her performance in Bread , Love and Dreams ( Pane , amore e fantasia , 1953 ) led to her receiving a BAFTA nomination and won a Nastro d'Argento award . Lollobrigida also appeared in The Wayward Wife ( 1953 ) and in Woman of Rome ( 1954 ) . These were three of her most renowned Italian films , but she worked also in the French industry on such films as Fearless Little Soldier ( Fanfan la Tulipe , 1952 ) , Beauties of the Night ( Les Belles de nuit , also 1952 ) and Le Grand Jeu ( 1954 ) .   Her first widely seen English language film was Beat the Devil ( 1953 ) , a film which was shot in Italy . In this film , directed by John Huston , she played the wife of Humphrey Bogart , with Jennifer Jones as her rival . She then took part in the Italian-American production Crossed Swords ( 1954 ) , co-starring with Errol Flynn . Her appearance in The World 's Most Beautiful Woman ( also known as Beautiful But Dangerous , 1955 ) led to her receiving the first David di Donatello for Best Actress award ; in this film she interpreted the Italian soprano Lina Cavalieri , singing some arias from Tosca with her own voice . She had the principal female lead in the circus drama Trapeze ( 1956 ) directed by Carol Reed co-starring with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis and in The Hunchback of Notre Dame ( 1956 ) , appeared as Esmeralda with Anthony Quinn as Quasimodo . The film was directed by Jean Delannoy .   In 1959 , she appeared in the French movie The Law , alongside Yves Montand and Marcello Mastroianni ; then , she co-starred with Frank Sinatra in Never So Few ( 1959 ) and with Yul Brynner in Solomon and Sheba ( also 1959 ) . The latter was the last film directed by King Vidor , and features an almost unique orgy scene in Hollywood motion pictures of that era ; furthermore , Brynner was chosen to substitute Tyrone Power , who died before the shots were completed .   In the romantic comedy Come September ( 1961 ) , Lollobrigida had a leading role along with Rock Hudson , Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin . It was a film for which she won a Golden Globe Award . She appeared , also in 1961 , with Ernest Borgnine and Anthony Franciosa in the drama Go Naked in the World .

There are 118 elements that have been identified , of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements . There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes , which decay over time into other elements . Iron is the most abundant element ( by mass ) making up Earth , while oxygen is the most common element in the crust of Earth .   Chemical elements constitute all of the ordinary matter of the universe . However astronomical observations suggest that ordinary observable matter is only approximately 15 % of the matter in the universe : the remainder is dark matter , the composition of which is unknown , but it is not composed of chemical elements .  The two lightest elements , hydrogen and helium were mostly formed in the Big Bang and are the most common elements in the universe . The next three elements ( lithium , beryllium and boron ) were formed mostly by cosmic ray spallation , and are thus more rare than those that follow . Formation of elements with from six to twenty six protons occurred and continues to occur in main sequence stars via stellar nucleosynthesis . The high abundance of oxygen , silicon , and iron on Earth reflects their common production in such stars . Elements with greater than twenty-six protons are formed by supernova nucleosynthesis in supernovae , which , when they explode , blast these elements far into space as supernova remnants , where they may become incorporated into planets when they are formed .   The term `` element '' is used for a kind of atoms with a given number of protons ( regardless of whether they are or they are not ionized or chemically bonded , e.g . hydrogen in water ) as well as for a pure chemical substance consisting of a single element ( e.g . hydrogen gas ) . For the second meaning , the terms `` elementary substance '' and `` simple substance '' have been suggested , but they have not gained much acceptance in the English-language chemical literature , whereas in some other languages their equivalent is widely used ( e.g . French corps simple , Russian простое вещество ) . One element can form multiple substances different by their structure ; they are called allotropes of the element .   When different elements are chemically combined , with the atoms held together by chemical bonds , they form chemical compounds . Only a minority of elements are found uncombined as relatively pure minerals . Among the more common of such `` native elements '' are copper , silver , gold , carbon ( as coal , graphite , or diamonds ) , and sulfur . All but a few of the most inert elements , such as noble gases and noble metals , are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form , as chemical compounds . While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms , most of these occur as mixtures . For example , atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen , oxygen , and argon , and native solid elements occur in alloys , such as that of iron and nickel .   The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon , sulfur , copper and gold . Later civilizations extracted elemental copper , tin , lead and iron from their ores by smelting , using charcoal . Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more , with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900 .   The properties of the chemical elements are summarized on the periodic table , which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows ( `` periods '' ) in which the columns ( `` groups '' ) share recurring ( `` periodic '' ) physical and chemical properties . Save for unstable radioactive elements with short half-lives , all of the elements are available industrially , most of them in high degrees of purity .   Description   The lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium , both created by Big Bang nucleosynthesis during the first 20 minutes of the universe in a ratio of around 3:1 by mass ( or 12:1 by number of atoms ) , along with tiny traces of the next two elements , lithium and"], [255, "Sir Cliff Richard ( born Harry Rodger Webb , 14 October 1940 ) is a British pop singer , musician , performer , actor and philanthropist . Richard has sold more than 250 million records worldwide . He has total sales of over 21 million singles in the UK and is the third-top-selling artist in UK Singles Chart history , behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley .   With his backing group , the Shadows , Richard , originally positioned as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard and Elvis Presley , dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s and early 1960s . His 1958 hit single , `` Move It '' , is often described as Britain 's first authentic rock and roll song , and John Lennon once claimed that `` before Cliff and the Shadows , there had been nothing worth listening to in British music . '' Increased focus on his Christian faith and subsequent softening of his music later led to a more middle of the road pop image , and he sometimes ventured into contemporary Christian music .   Over a career spanning more than 50 years Richard has amassed many gold and platinum discs and awards , including three Brit Awards—winning Best British Male twice and the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music , and two Ivor Novello Awards . He has had more than 130 singles , albums and EPs make the UK Top 20 , more than any other artist and holds the record ( with Elvis Presley ) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades ( 1950s–2000s ) . He has achieved 14 UK No . 1 singles , and is the only singer to have had a No . 1 single in the UK in five consecutive decades : the 1950s through to the 1990s .   In 2008 , he celebrated his 50th anniversary in music by releasing a greatest hits album , featuring the new track `` Thank You for a Lifetime '' , which reached No . 3 in the UK singles chart . In November 2013 , Richard released The Fabulous Rock 'n ' Roll Songbook , which became the 100th album of his career .   Richard has never achieved the same impact in the United States despite eight US Top 40 singles , including the million-selling `` Devil Woman '' and `` We Do n't Talk Anymore , '' the latter becoming the first to reach the Billboard Hot 100 's top 40 in the 1980s by a singer who had been in the Billboard top 40 in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s . In Canada , Richard achieved comparatively more success , with a successful period in the early 1960s , and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s with some singles and albums reaching gold and platinum status . He has remained a popular music , film , and television personality in Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Northern Europe and Asia , and he retains a following in other countries .   Richard has been a resident in the United Kingdom for most of his life , but in 2010 , he confirmed that he had become a citizen of Barbados . He divides his time between living in Barbados and Portugal .

He is known by the epithet `` father of modern taxonomy '' . Many of his writings were in Latin , and his name is rendered in Latin as ( after 1761 Carolus a Linné ) .   Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Småland , in southern Sweden . He received most of his higher education at Uppsala University , and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730 . He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738 , where he studied and also published a first edition of his ' in the Netherlands . He then returned to Sweden , where he became professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala . In the 1740s , he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals . In the 1750s and 1760s , he continued to collect and classify animals , plants , and minerals , and published several volumes . At the time of his death , he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe .   The Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message : `` Tell him I know no greater man on earth . '' The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote : `` With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza , I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly . '' Swedish author August Strindberg wrote : `` Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist '' . Among other compliments , Linnaeus has been called ' ( Prince of Botanists ) , `` The Pliny of the North , '' and `` The Second Adam '' . He is also considered as one of the founders of modern ecology .   In botany , the author abbreviation used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for species ' names is L. In older publications , sometimes the abbreviation `` Linn . '' is found ( for instance in : Cheeseman , T.F . ( 1906 ) – Manual of the New Zealand Flora ) . Linnaeus ' remains comprise the type specimen for the species Homo sapiens , following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , since the sole specimen he is known to have examined when writing the species description was himself .

''   Biography   Childhood   Linnæus was born in the village of Råshult in Småland , Sweden , on 23 May 1707 . He was the first child of Nicolaus ( Nils ) Ingemarsson ( who later adopted the family name Linnæus ) and Christina Brodersonia . His siblings were Anna Maria Linnæa , Sofia Juliana Linnæa , Samuel Linnæus , and Emerentia Linnæa .   One of a long line of peasants and priests , Nils was an amateur botanist , a Lutheran minister , and the curate of the small village of Stenbrohult in Småland . Christina was the daughter of the rector of Stenbrohult , Samuel Brodersonius .   A year after Linnæus ' birth , his grandfather Samuel Brodersonius died , and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult . The family moved into the rectory from the curate 's house . Carl had one brother , Samuel ( who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on beekeeping ) . and three sisters .   Even in his early years , Linnæus seemed to have a liking for plants , flowers in particular . Whenever he was upset , he was given a flower , which immediately calmed him . Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names . Soon Linnæus was given his own patch of"], [257, "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a cricket field , at the centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch with a wicket , a set of three wooden stumps sited at each end . One team , designated the batting team , attempts to score as many runs as possible , whilst their opponents field . Each phase of play is called an innings . After either ten batsmen have been dismissed or a set number of overs have been completed , the innings ends and the two teams then swap roles . The winning team is the one that scores the most runs , including any extras gained , during their period batting .   At the start of each game , two batsmen and eleven fielders enter the field of play . The play begins when a designated member of the fielding team , known as the bowler , delivers the ball from one end of the pitch to the other , towards a set of wooden stumps , in front of which stands one of the batsmen , known as the striker . The striker 's role is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps through use of his bat , and simultaneously strike it sufficiently well to score runs . The other batsman , known as the non-striker , waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler . The bowler 's intention is to both prevent the scoring of runs and to dismiss the batsman , at which point the dismissed batsman has to leave the field and another teammate replaces him at the crease .   The most common forms of dismissal are bowled , when the bowler hits the stumps directly with the ball , leg before wicket , when the batsman prevents the ball from hitting the stumps with his body instead of his bat , and caught , when the batsman hits the ball into the air and it is intercepted by a fielder before touching the ground . Runs are scored through two main methods : either hitting the ball sufficiently powerfully that it crosses the boundary , or through the two batsmen swapping ends by each simultaneously running the length of the pitch in opposite directions whilst the fielders are retrieving the ball . If a fielder is able to retrieve the ball sufficiently quickly and put down the wicket with either batsman out of his ground , a run-out occurs . Adjudication is performed on-field by two umpires .   The laws of cricket are maintained by the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) and Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) . There are various formats ranging from Twenty20 , played over a few hours with each team having a single innings of 20 overs , to Test cricket , played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams playing two innings apiece . Traditionally , cricketers play in all-white kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours . In addition to the basic kit , some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard , solid object made of compressed leather enclosing a cork core .   Although cricket 's origins are uncertain , it is first recorded in south-east England in the 16th century . It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire , leading to the first international matches in the mid-19th century . ICC , the game 's governing body , has over 100 members , ten of which are full members who play Test cricket . Women 's cricket , which is organised and played separately , has also achieved international standard . Cricket is the world 's second most popular spectator sport , after association football , and is followed primarily in Australasia , Great Britain and Ireland , the Indian subcontinent , southern Africa and the West Indies .   Etymology   A number of words have been suggested as sources for the term `` cricket '' . In the earliest definite reference to the sport in 1598 it is called creckett . One possible source for the name is the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff.Birley , p. 3 . In Samuel Johnson 's Dictionary , he derived cricket from `` cryce , Saxon , a stick '' . In Old French , the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick .

The Czech Republic covers an area of with mostly temperate continental climate . It is a unitary parliamentary republic , has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague , with over 1.2 million residents . The Czech Republic includes its historical territories of Bohemia , Moravia , and Czech Silesia .   The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire . After the fall of the Empire in 907 , the centre of power transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the Přemyslid dynasty . In 1004 , the duchy was formally recognized as part of the Holy Roman Empire , becoming the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 and reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century . Besides Bohemia itself , the king of Bohemia ruled the lands of the Bohemian Crown , he had a vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor , and Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century . In the Hussite wars of the 15th century driven by the Bohemian Reformation , the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five crusades proclaimed by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church .   Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526 , the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary . The Protestant Bohemian Revolt ( 1618–20 ) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years ' War , after which the monarchy consolidated its rule , reimposed Catholicism , and adopted a policy of gradual Germanization . With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 , the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire and the Czech language experienced a revival as a consequence of widespread romantic nationalism . In the 19th century , the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia , which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I .   Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany in World War II , and was liberated in 1945 by the Soviet and the United States armies . The country lost the majority of its German-speaking inhabitants after they were expelled following the war . The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won the 1946 elections . Following the 1948 coup d'état , Czechoslovakia became a one-party communist state under Soviet influence . In 1968 , increasing dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known as the Prague Spring , which ended in a Soviet-led invasion . Czechoslovakia remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution , when the communist regime collapsed and a multiparty parliamentary republic was formed . On 1 January 1993 , Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved , with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia .   The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004 ; it is a member of the United Nations , the OECD , the OSCE , and the Council of Europe . It is a developed country with an advanced , high income economy and high living standards . The UNDP ranks the country 14th in inequality-adjusted human development . The Czech Republic also ranks as the 6th most peaceful country , while achieving strong performance in democratic governance . It has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union .   Etymology   The traditional English name `` Bohemia '' derives from Latin `` Boiohaemum '' , which means `` home of the Boii '' . The current name comes from the endonym Čech , spelled `` Cžech '' until the orthographic reform in 1842 .  The name comes from the Slavic tribe ( Czechs , ) and , according to legend , their leader Čech , who brought them to Bohemia , to settle on Říp Mountain . The etymology of the word Čech can be traced back to the Proto-Slavic root * čel- , meaning `` member of the people ; kinsman '' , thus making it cognate to the Czech word člověk ( a person ) .   The country has been traditionally divided into three lands , namely Bohemia ( Čechy ) in the west , Moravia ( Morava ) in the southeast , and Czech Silesia ( Slezsko ;"], [259, "Lawrence Mark `` Larry '' Sanger ( ; born July 16 , 1968 ) is an American Internet project developer , co-founder of Wikipedia , and the founder of Citizendium .  He grew up in Anchorage , Alaska . From an early age he has been interested in philosophy . Sanger received a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Reed College in 1991 and a Doctor of Philosophy in philosophy from Ohio State University in 2000 . Most of his philosophical work has focused on epistemology , the theory of knowledge .   He has been involved with various online encyclopedia projects . He is the former editor-in-chief of Nupedia ,  chief organizer ( 2001–02 ) of its successor , Wikipedia , and founding editor-in-chief of Citizendium . From his position at Nupedia , he assembled the process for article development . Sanger proposed implementing a wiki , which led directly to the creation of Wikipedia . Initially Wikipedia was a complementary project for Nupedia . He was Wikipedia 's early community leader and established many of its original policies .   Sanger left Wikipedia in 2002 , and has since been critical of the project . He states that , despite its merits , Wikipedia lacks credibility due to , among other things , a lack of respect for expertise . In October 2006 , Sanger started a somewhat similar encyclopedia to Wikipedia , Citizendium .   Sanger has taught philosophy at Ohio State University and was an early strategist for the expert-authored Encyclopedia of Earth . He has worked on developing educational projects for individuals behind WatchKnowLearn . He has designed a web-based reading program named Reading Bear which aims to teach children how to read . In February 2013 , he attempted to start a news crowdsourcing project named Infobitt ; it ran out of money in mid-2015 without the code being ready to handle a fullscale launch .   Early life and education   Sanger was born in Bellevue , Washington . His father was a marine biologist and his mother cared for the children .  When he was seven years old , the family moved to Anchorage , Alaska .  At an early age , he was interested in philosophical topics .   He graduated from high school in 1986 and went off to Reed College , majoring in philosophy . In college he became interested in the Internet and its publishing abilities .  He set up a listserver as a medium for students and tutors to meet up for `` expert tutoring '' and `` to act as a forum for discussion of tutorials , tutorial methods , and the possibility and merits of a voluntary , free network of individual tutors and students finding each other via the Internet for education outside the traditional university setting . ''  He started and moderated a philosophy discussion list , the Association for Systematic Philosophy .  Sanger wrote in 1994 a manifesto for the discussion group :   The history of philosophy is full of disagreement and confusion . One reaction by philosophers to this state of things is to doubt whether the truth about philosophy can ever be known , or whether there is any such thing as the truth about philosophy . But there is another reaction : one may set out to think more carefully and methodically than one 's intellectual forebears .   Sanger received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from Reed College in 1991 , a Master of Arts from Ohio State University in 1995 , and a Doctor of Philosophy from Ohio State University in 2000 . Beginning in 1998 he ran a website called `` Sanger 's Review of Y2K News Reports '' , a resource for those concerned about the year 2000 problem , such as managers of computer systems .   Philosophy   In 2007 , Sanger examined the possibilities for education online . He explained , `` Imagine that education were not delivered but organized and managed in a way that were fully digitized , decentralized , self-directed , asynchronous , and at-a-distance . '' He further stated , `` There would be no bureaucracy to enforce anything beyond some very basic rules , and decision-making would be placed almost entirely in the hands of teachers and students . ''   In 2007 , Sanger wrote an essay for the Edge stating in part :   As it turns out , our many Web 2.0 revolutionaries have been so thoroughly seized with the successes of strong collaboration that they are resistant to recognizing some hard truths .

He was also an important printmaker in etching . He was the son of the painter Bernardo Canal , he visited England between 1746–56 and he is famous for his urban landscapes of Venice . He is very famous for his scenes , usually associated with `` evocative views of the city '' . The Stonemason´s Yard , was his finest work around 1725 and was presented by Sir George Beaumont in 1823/8 .   Canaletto , together with Giambattista Pittoni , Giovan Battista Tiepolo , Giovan Battista Piazzetta , Giuseppe Maria Crespi and Francesco Guardi forms the ultimate group of Venetian old master painters .   Early career   He was born in Venice as the son of the painter Bernardo Canal , hence his mononym Canaletto ( `` little Canal '' ) , and Artemisia Barbieri . Canaletto served his apprenticeship with his father and his brother . He began in his father 's occupation , that of a theatrical scene painter . Canaletto was inspired by the Roman vedutista Giovanni Paolo Pannini , and started painting the daily life of the city and its people .   After returning from Rome in 1719 , he began painting in his topographical style . His first known signed and dated work is Architectural Capriccio ( 1723 , Milan , in a private collection ) . Studying with the older Luca Carlevarijs , a moderately-talented painter of urban cityscapes , he rapidly became his master 's equal .   In 1725 , the painter Alessandro Marchesini , who was also the buyer for the Lucchese art collector Stefano Conti , had inquired about buying two more 'views of Venice ' , when the agent urged him to consider instead the work of `` Antonio Canale ... it is like Carlevaris , but you can see the sun shining in it . ''   Outdoor painting   Much of Canaletto 's early artwork was painted `` from nature '' , differing from the then customary practice of completing paintings in the studio . Some of his later works do revert to this custom , as suggested by the tendency for distant figures to be painted as blobs of colour – an effect produced by using a camera obscura , which blurs farther-away objects .   However , his paintings are always notable for their accuracy : he recorded the seasonal submerging of Venice in water and ice .   Early and late work   Canaletto 's early works remain his most coveted and , according to many authorities , his best . One of his early pieces is The Stonemason 's Yard ( 1729 , London , the National Gallery ) which depicts a humble working area of the city .   Later Canaletto painted grand scenes of the canals of Venice and the Doge 's Palace . His large-scale landscapes portrayed the city 's pageantry and waning traditions , making innovative use of atmospheric effects and strong local colors . For these qualities , his works may be said to have anticipated Impressionism .   His graphic print S.A Giustina in Prà della Vale was found in the 2012 Nazi loot discovery .   Work in England   Many of his pictures were sold to Englishmen on their Grand Tour , often through the agency of the merchant Joseph Smith ( who was later appointed British Consul in Venice in 1744 ) .   It was Smith who acted as an agent for Canaletto , first in requesting paintings of Venice from the painter in the early 1720s and helping him to sell his paintings to other Englishmen .   In the 1740s Canaletto 's market was disrupted when the War of the Austrian Succession led to a reduction in the number of British visitors to Venice . Smith also arranged for the publication of a series of etchings of `` capricci '' ( or architectural phantasies ) ( capriccio Italian for fancy ) in his vedute ideale , but the returns were not high enough , and in 1746 Canaletto moved to London , to be closer to his market .   He remained in England until 1755 , producing views of London ( including several of the new Westminster Bridge , which was completed during his stay ) and of his patrons ' castles and houses . His 1754 painting of Old Walton Bridge includes an image of Canaletto himself .   He was often expected to paint England"], [261, "Chief Clarence `` Clancy '' Wiggum is a fictional character from the animated television series The Simpsons , voiced by Hank Azaria . He is the chief of police in the show 's setting of Springfield . He is the father of Ralph Wiggum and the husband of Sarah Wiggum .   The character 's comedic value relies heavily on his incompetence and irresponsibility as a police officer , and his laziness and gluttony . Chief Wiggum 's more responsible fellow officers Eddie and Lou play the straight men to his shenanigans .   Biography   Chief Wiggum was born in Ireland and moved to Springfield at an early age . Per the episode Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in `` The Curse of the Flying Hellfish '' , Wiggum 's father , Iggy , served in Abe Simpson 's infantry squad , implying the Wiggums emigrated to America by the early 1940s at the latest . In the episode `` Mother Simpson '' , a teenaged Wiggum was a trainee security guard at Springfield University when Homer 's mother Mona sabotaged the University 's laboratory , which Mr. Burns was using for biological weapons . Antibiotics used to kill the weapons cured Wiggum 's asthma , allowing him to join the police force .   Many episodes have dealt with the back story of how Wiggum , despite his incompetences , occupies such a high role in the police force . As with those of most supporting characters on the show , they are jokes for one episode and contradict each other . Wiggum was temporarily promoted to Commissioner of Police for Springfield 's state in the 2005 episode `` Pranksta Rap '' .   Chief Wiggum is the father of Ralph Wiggum , whom he loves and is patient of , but he sometimes does not understand his son 's eccentricities .   Incompetence   Wiggum 's descriptions of suspects , evidence and location is often very poor . He also has been known to arrest people impulsively , disregarding their involvement of a determined situation or crime , evident in `` Brother from Another Series '' where he arrested Sideshow Bob by the incidents of the episode , despite Bart and Lisa ( the main witnesses ) confirming his innocence , and in `` The Frying Game '' where he gleefully condemns Homer and Marge to death for murder without using a lie detector or making a DNA examination . He has also , on occasions had people arrested or put in a jail cell for an invalid reason . For example in `` Midnight Rx '' , he attempts to arrest Grandpa on a charge of startling a police officer rather than for the drug smuggling he had been involved in with Homer during the episode . in `` Much Apu About Nothing '' , he orders Barney to be booked on one count of being an accessory to being a bear , in `` Homer 's Barbershop Quartet '' , it is implied that he arrests Homer , Principal Skinner , Barney and Apu for rejecting him from their group The B-Sharps and in `` On a Clear Day I Ca n't See My Sister '' he puts Lou in a police cell because his coffee came back cold ( despite Lou insisting that Wiggum ordered `` an iced coffee ) . Furthermore in `` The Seven-Beer Snitch '' , he assists Mr Burns in filling up his newly opened prison with convicts by reinstating old and forgotten laws- which subsequently results in Homer being arrested for `` Illegally transporting litter '' ( five kicks of the same can ) .   Wiggum also often fails to comply with his police duties in a real emergency , and sometimes does not take emergency calls seriously . Occasionally , he turns off his receiver when he is not in the mood to fight crime , or makes an excuse that he is too busy to help and it is then shown that the police are taking part in a trivial activity . He has demonstrated a lack of respect for firearms safety , having sold parts of his service pistol after losing his job ( `` Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment '' ) , used it to crack walnuts ( `` I Love Lisa '' ) and eaten donuts off its barrel , nearly killing himself as a result when it goes off ( The Simpsons Movie ) .   It is also frequently implied that Chief Wiggum is corrupt . He has been seen asking both Homer and Troy McLure for bribes and on his badge , it states `` Cash Bribes only ''"], [262, "Melbourne City Centre ( sometimes referred to as `` Central City '' , and colloquially known as simply `` The City '' ) is an area of Melbourne , Victoria , Australia . It is the area in which Melbourne was established in 1835 , by John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner , and its boundaries are defined by the Government of Victoria 's Melbourne Planning Scheme . Today it comprises the two oldest areas of Melbourne ; the Hoddle Grid and Queen Victoria Market , as well as sections of the redeveloped areas of Docklands and Southbank/Wharf . It is not to be confused with the larger local government area of the City of Melbourne .   It is the core central activities district ( CAD ) of Melbourne 's inner suburbs and the major central business district ( CBD ) of Greater Melbourne 's metropolitan area , and is a major financial centre in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region . The Hoddle Grid in the City Centre is home to Melbourne 's famed alleyways and arcades and is renowned for its distinct blend of contemporary and Victorian architecture as well as expansive parks and gardens which surround its edges . The City Centre is home to five of the six tallest buildings in Australia . In recent times , it has been placed alongside New York City and Berlin as one of the world 's great street art meccas , and designated a `` City of Literature '' by UNESCO in its Creative Cities Network .   Foundation   Batman 's Treaty   In April 1835 , John Batman , a prominent grazier and a member of the Geelong and Dutigalla Association ( later Port Phillip Association ) , sailed from Launceston on the island of Van Diemen 's Land ( now the State of Tasmania ) , aboard the schooner Rebecca , in search of fresh grazing land in the south-east of the Colony of New South Wales ( the mainland Australian continent ) . He sailed across Bass Strait , into the bay of Port Phillip , and arrived at the mouth of the Yarra River in May . After exploring the surrounding area , he met with the elders of the indigenous Aboriginal group , the Wurundjeri of the Kulin nation alliance , and negotiated a transaction for 600,000 acres ( 2,400 km² ; 940 mi² ) which later became known as Batman 's Treaty . The transaction , which is believed to have taken place on the bank of Merri Creek ( near the modern day suburb of Northcote ) , consisted of an offering of : blankets , knives , mirrors , sugar , and other such items ; to be also tributed annually to the Wurundjeri . The last sentence of Batman 's journal entry on this day became famous as the founding charter of the settlement .   Upon returning to Van Diemen 's Land , Batman 's treaty was deemed invalid by the Governor of New South Wales , Sir Richard Bourke , under the Proclamation of Governor Bourke in August 1835 . It was the belief of Governor Bourke , as well as the Governor of Van Diemen 's Land , Sir George Arthur , that the Aboriginal people did not have any official claims to the lands of the Australian continent . The proclamation formally declared , under the doctrine of terra nullius , that The Crown owned the whole of the Australian continent and that only it alone could sell and distribute land . It therefore voided any contracts or treaties made without the consent of the government , and declared any person attempting to rely on such a treaty to be trespassing . However , at the time the proclamation was being drawn up , a prominent businessman from Van Diemen 's Land , John Pascoe Fawkner , had also funded an expedition to the area ; which sailed from George Town aboard the schooner Enterprize . At the same time , the Port Phillip Association had also funded a second expedition ; which sailed from Launceston aboard the Rebecca .   Fawkner 's fait accompli   The settlement party aboard the Enterprize entered the Yarra River , and anchored close to the site chosen by Batman , on 29 August . The party went ashore the following day ( near what is today William Street ; and is now celebrated as Melbourne Day ) and landed their stores , livestock and began to construct the settlement . The Association party aboard the Rebecca arrived in September after spending time at a temporary camp at Indented Head , where they encountered William Buckley – an escaped convict , believed"], [263, "Linus van Pelt is a character in Charles M. Schulz 's comic strip Peanuts . The best friend of Charlie Brown , Linus is also the younger brother of Lucy van Pelt and older brother of Rerun van Pelt . He first appeared on September 19 , 1952 , but was not mentioned by name until three days later . He was first referenced two months earlier , on July 14 . Linus spoke his first words in 1954 , the same year he was shown with his security blanket .   The character 's creator , Charles M. Schulz , has said of the character , `` Linus , my serious side , is the house intellectual , bright , well-informed which , I suppose may contribute to his feelings of insecurity . ''   Lee Mendelson , producer of the majority of the Peanuts television specials , has said that Linus is his favorite character :   Personality   Though young , Linus is very intelligent , and acts as the strip 's philosopher and theologian , often quoting the Gospels . Juvenile aspects of his character are also displayed ; for example , Linus is almost always depicted holding his blue security blanket—for which he is often mocked by other characters—and often sucks his thumb . He invented his own legendary being , the Great Pumpkin , who , Linus claims , appears every Halloween at the most `` sincere '' pumpkin patch , bearing gifts . Linus is the only person who believes in the Great Pumpkin , although he occasionally temporarily convinces other characters the Great Pumpkin is real , only to stubbornly maintain his faith when they lose theirs . On one occasion , Linus had a commanding lead in the polls for school president—until he brought up the subject of the Great Pumpkin , at which point he was nearly laughed out of the election . ( He ended up winning anyway by one vote , cast by his opponent , who decided that Linus would make a better school president . ) A similar occurrence was featured in a strip with the same storyline ; Charlie Brown asks him why he had to bring up the Great Pumpkin and Linus gives his reasons . After Linus says that Charlie Brown is looking at him as if he was crazy , Charlie Brown responds , `` I 'm looking at you like I could 've been vice president ! ''   Security Blanket   Linus is almost never seen without his blue security blanket , which debuted in the June 1 , 1954 , strip . He holds it over his shoulder while sucking his thumb . Ridicule of the habit is not a major concern for him . His friend Roy warned him at summer camp that he would be viciously teased for it ; in response , Linus used his blanket like a whip and sheared off a tree branch with intimidating power , saying , `` They never tease me more than once . '' The blanket , it turns out , is an autonomous ( although nonverbal ) entity . In a 1965 strip , it engaged in a campaign of clandestine attacks on Lucy , even routing her from the house , due to her constant , albeit failed , attempts to get rid of it by throwing it in the trash burner . In the special A Boy Named Charlie Brown , it performed a complex dance routine with Linus upon being reunited with its owner . Linus had lost the blanket , causing him depression , panic attacks , sweating and other withdrawal symptoms .   In the earlier strips , Linus 's relationship to his blanket was one of intense emotional attachment to the point of manifesting physical symptoms if he was deprived of it even for a short while . He suffered weakness and dizziness , for example , when Lucy took it from him only long enough to have it laundered , spontaneously recovering when it was restored to him . In A Boy Named Charlie Brown , Linus manifested similar symptoms when he gave his blanket to Charlie Brown . On another occasion , Lucy snatched his blanket away and buried it in an effort to break Linus of his habit . Linus literally dug up the neighborhood for days trying to find it until Snoopy finally dug it up .   Possession of the blanket is often sought by Snoopy , who has used many tricks and subterfuges to relieve Linus of it , even at one point having the blanket delivered to his doghouse . Snoopy commonly runs up , quickly grabs"], [264, "Wales ( ; ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain . It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west , and the Bristol Channel to the south . It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20779 km2 . Wales has over 1680 mi of coastline and is largely mountainous , with its higher peaks in the north and central areas , including Snowdon ( ) , its highest summit . The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable , maritime climate .   Welsh national identity emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century , and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales , though Owain Glyndŵr briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century . The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century . Welsh Liberalism , exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century ; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962 . Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , the National Assembly for Wales holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters .   At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation ; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales ' population . Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales , mainly in and around Cardiff ( the capital ) , Swansea and Newport , and in the nearby valleys . Now that the country 's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline , Wales ' economy depends on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . Wales ' 2010 gross value added ( GVA ) was £45.5 billion ( £15,145 per head , 74.0 % of the average for the UK , and the lowest GVA per head in Britain ) .   Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain , and the vast majority of the population speaks English , the country has retained a distinct cultural identity and is officially bilingual . Over 560,000 Welsh language speakers live in Wales , and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west . From the late 19th century onwards , Wales acquired its popular image as the `` land of song '' , in part due to the eisteddfod tradition . At many international sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams , though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness .   Etymology   The English words `` Wales '' and `` Welsh '' derive from the same Germanic root ( singular Walh , plural Walha ) , which was itself derived from the name of the Celtic tribe known to the Romans as Volcae and which came to refer indiscriminately to all Celts and , later , to all inhabitants of the Roman Empire . The Old English-speaking Anglo-Saxons came to use the term Wælisc when referring to the Celtic Britons in particular , and Wēalas when referring to their lands . The modern names for some Continental European lands ( e.g . Wallonia and Wallachia ) and peoples ( e.g . the Vlachs via a borrowing into Old Church Slavonic ) have a similar etymology .   Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that the Anglo-Saxons associated with the Britons , including other non-Germanic territories in Britain ( e.g . Cornwall ) and Germanic territories particularly associated with Celtic Britons ( e.g . Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ) , as well as items associated with non-Germanic Europeans , such as the walnut .   The modern Welsh name for themselves"], [265, "Ancient Rome was an Italic civilization that began on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 8th century BC . Located along the Mediterranean Sea and centered on the city of Rome , it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants ( roughly 20 % of the world 's populationMcEvedy and Jones ( 1978 ) . ) and covering 6.5 million square kilometers ( 2.5 million sq mi ) at its height between the first and second centuries AD .   In its approximately 12 centuries of existence , Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to a classical republic and then to an increasingly autocratic empire . Through conquest and assimilation , it came to dominate Southern and Western Europe , Asia Minor , North Africa , and parts of Northern and Eastern Europe . Rome was preponderant throughout the Mediterranean region and was one of the most powerful entities of the ancient world . It is often grouped into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece , and their similar cultures and societies are known as the Greco-Roman world .   Ancient Roman society has contributed to modern government , law , politics , engineering , art , literature , architecture , technology , warfare , religion , language and society . A highly developed civilization , Rome professionalized and expanded its military and created a system of government called res publica , the inspiration for modern republics such as the United States and France . It achieved impressive technological and architectural feats , such as the construction of an extensive system of aqueducts and roads , as well as the construction of large monuments , palaces , and public facilities .   By the end of the Republic ( 27 BC ) , Rome had conquered the lands around the Mediterranean and beyond : its domain extended from the Atlantic to Arabia and from the mouth of the Rhine to North Africa . The Roman Empire emerged with the end of the Republic and the dictatorship of Augustus Caesar . 721 years of Roman-Persian Wars started in 92 BC with their first war against Parthia . It would become the longest conflict in human history , and have major lasting effects and consequences for both empires . Under Trajan , the Empire reached its territorial peak . Republican mores and traditions started to decline during the imperial period , with civil wars becoming a prelude common to the rise of a new emperor . Splinter states , such as the Palmyrene Empire , would temporarily divide the Empire during the crisis of the 3rd century .   Plagued by internal instability and attacked by various migrating peoples , the western part of the empire broke up into independent kingdoms in the 5th century . This splintering is a landmark historians use to divide the ancient period of universal history from the pre-medieval `` Dark Ages '' of Europe .   Founding myth   According to the founding myth of Rome , the city was founded on 21 April 753 BC by twin brothers Romulus and Remus , who descended from the Trojan prince Aeneas and who were grandsons of the Latin King , Numitor of Alba Longa . King Numitor was deposed from his throne by his brother , Amulius , while Numitor 's daughter , Rhea Silvia , gave birth to the twins . Because Rhea Silvia was raped and impregnated by Mars , the Roman god of war , the twins were considered half-divine .   The new king , Amulius , feared Romulus and Remus would take back the throne , so he ordered them to be drowned . A she-wolf ( or a shepherd 's wife in some accounts ) saved and raised them , and when they were old enough , they returned the throne of Alba Longa to Numitor .   The twins then founded their own city , but Romulus killed Remus in a quarrel over the location of the Roman Kingdom , though some sources state the quarrel was about who was going to rule or give his name to the city . Romulus became the source of the city 's name . In order to attract people to the city , Rome became a sanctuary for the indigent , exiled , and unwanted . This caused a problem for Rome , which had a large workforce but was bereft of women . Romulus traveled to the neighboring towns and tribes and attempted to secure marriage rights , but as Rome was so full of undesirables they all refused . Legend says that the Latins invited the Sabines to a"], [266, "`` God Save the Queen '' ( alternatively `` God Save the King '' , depending on the gender of the reigning monarch ) is the national and/or royal anthem in a number of Commonwealth realms , their territories , and the British Crown Dependencies . The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant , but a 1619 attribution to John Bull is sometimes made .   It is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national anthems used by New Zealand since 1977 , as well as for several of the UK 's territories that have their own additional local anthem . It is also the royal anthem of all the aforementioned countries , as well as Australia ( since 1984 ) , Canada ( since 1980 ) , Barbados and Tuvalu . In countries not previously part of the British Empire , the tune of `` God Save the Queen '' has provided the basis for various patriotic songs , though still generally connected with royal ceremony . In the United States , the melody is used for the patriotic song `` My Country , 'T is of Thee '' . The melody is also used for the national anthem of Liechtenstein , Oben am jungen Rhein ( `` Up above the Young Rhine '' ) .   Beyond its first verse , which is consistent , `` God Save the King/Queen '' has many historic and extant versions . Since its first publication , different verses have been added and taken away and , even today , different publications include various selections of verses in various orders . In general , only one verse is sung . Sometimes two verses are sung , and on rare occasions , three .   The sovereign and his or her consort are saluted with the entire anthem , while other members of the Royal Family who are entitled to royal salute ( such as the Prince of Wales ) receive just the first six bars . The first six bars also form all or part of the Vice Regal Salute in some Commonwealth realms outside the UK ( e.g. , in Canada , governors general and lieutenant governors at official events are saluted with the first six bars of `` God Save the Queen '' followed by the first four and last four bars of `` O Canada '' ) , as well as the salute given to governors of British overseas territories .   History   In The Oxford Companion to Music , Percy Scholes points out the similarities to an early plainsong melody , although the rhythm is very distinctly that of a galliard , and he gives examples of several such dance tunes that bear a striking resemblance to `` God Save The King/Queen '' . Scholes quotes a keyboard piece by John Bull ( 1619 ) which has some similarities to the modern tune , depending on the placing of accidentals which at that time were unwritten in certain cases and left to the discretion of the player ( see musica ficta ) . He also points to several pieces by Henry Purcell , one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune , set to the words `` God Save The King '' . Nineteenth-century scholars and commentators mention the widespread belief that an old Scots carol , `` Remember O Thou Man '' was the source of the tune .   The first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in Thesaurus Musicus . The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year , with the landing of Charles Edward Stuart and was published in The Gentleman 's Magazine ( see illustration above ) . This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points , one as early as the first bar , but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem . It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745 , with , for example , Thomas Arne writing a setting of the tune for the Drury Lane Theatre .   Scholes ' analysis includes mention of `` untenable '' and `` doubtful '' claims , as well as `` an American misattribution '' . Some of these are :  * The French Marquise de Créquy wrote in her book `` Souvenirs '' , that the tune Grand Dieu Sauve Le Roi , was written by Jean-Baptiste Lully in gratitude for the survival by Louis XIV of an anal fistula operation . The surgical knife that was purpose-built for the occasion is"], [267, "The Gulf War ( 2 August 1990 – 28 February 1991 ) , codenamed Operation Desert Shield ( 2 August 1990 – 17 January 1991 ) , for operations leading to the buildup of troops and defense of Saudi Arabia and Operation Desert Storm ( 17 January 1991 – 28 February 1991 ) in its combat phase , was a war waged by coalition forces from 34 nations led by the United States against Iraq in response to Iraq 's invasion and annexation of Kuwait .   The war is also known under other names , such as the Persian Gulf War , First Gulf War , Gulf War I , Kuwait War , First Iraq War , or Iraq War before the term `` Iraq War '' became identified instead with the 2003 Iraq War ( also referred to in the U.S. as `` Operation Iraqi Freedom '' ) .  The Iraqi Army 's occupation of Kuwait that began 2 August 1990 was met with international condemnation , and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the U.N. Security Council . U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia , and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene . An array of nations joined the Coalition , the largest military alliance since World War II . The great majority of the Coalition 's military forces were from the U.S. , with Saudi Arabia , the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors , in that order . Kuwait and Saudi Arabia paid around US $ 32 billion of the US $ 60 billion cost .   The war was marked by the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle , principally by the U.S. network CNN . The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast of images from cameras on board U.S. bombers during Operation Desert Storm .   The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial and naval bombardment on 17 January 1991 , continuing for five weeks . This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February . This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces , who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory . The Coalition ceased its advance , and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started . Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq , Kuwait , and areas on Saudi Arabia 's border . Iraq launched Scud missiles against Coalition military targets in Saudi Arabia and against Israel .   Terminology   The following names have been used to describe the conflict itself :  * Gulf War and Persian Gulf War have been the most common terms for the conflict used within western countries . A problem with these terms is that the usage is ambiguous , having now been applied to at least three conflicts : see Gulf War ( disambiguation ) . The use of the term Persian Gulf ( as opposed to Arabian Gulf ) is also disputed : see Persian Gulf naming dispute . With no consensus of naming , various publications have attempted to refine the name . Some variants include :  * * Gulf War ( e.g . The Gulf War , BBC television series , 2005 ; Modern Conflicts : The Gulf War , Discovery Channel DVD set , 2010 )  * * Persian Gulf War ( e.g .

He is one of the Twelve Olympians , and the son of Zeus and Hera . In Greek literature , he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war , in contrast to his sister the armored Athena , whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship .   The Greeks were ambivalent toward Ares : although he embodied the physical valor necessary for success in war , he was a dangerous force , `` overwhelming , insatiable in battle , destructive , and man-slaughtering . '' His sons Fear ( Phobos ) and Terror ( Deimos ) and his lover , or sister , Discord ( Enyo ) accompanied him on his war chariot . In the Iliad , his father Zeus tells him that he is the god most hateful to him . An association with Ares endows places and objects with a savage , dangerous , or militarized quality . His value as a war god is placed in doubt : during the Trojan War , Ares was on the losing side , while Athena , often depicted in Greek art as holding Nike ( Victory ) in her hand , favored the triumphant Greeks .   Ares plays a relatively limited role in Greek mythology as represented in literary narratives , though his numerous love affairs and abundant offspring are often alluded to . When Ares does appear in myths , he typically faces humiliation . He is well known as the lover of Aphrodite , the goddess of love , who was married to Hephaestus , god of craftsmanship . The most famous story related to Ares and Aphrodite shows them exposed to ridicule through the wronged husband 's clever device .   The counterpart of Ares among the Roman gods is Mars , Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia , The Book People , Haydock , 1995 , p. 215. who as a father of the Roman people was given a more important and dignified place in ancient Roman religion as a guardian deity . During the Hellenization of Latin literature , the myths of Ares were reinterpreted by Roman writers under the name of Mars . Greek writers under Roman rule also recorded cult practices and beliefs pertaining to Mars under the name of Ares . Thus in the classical tradition of later Western art and literature , the mythology of the two figures becomes virtually indistinguishable .   Names and epithets   The etymology of the name Ares is traditionally connected with the Greek word ( arē ) , the Ionic form of the Doric ( ara ) , `` bane , ruin , curse , imprecation '' . There may also be a connection with the Roman god of war Mars , via hypothetical Proto-Indo-European * M̥rēs ; compare Ancient Greek μάρναμαι ( marnamai ) , `` I fight , I battle '' . Walter Burkert notes that `` Ares is apparently an ancient abstract noun meaning throng of battle , war . '' R. S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name .   The earliest attested form of the name is the Mycenaean Greek , a-re , written in the Linear B syllabic script .   The adjectival epithet , Areios , was frequently appended to the names of other gods when they took on a warrior aspect or became involved in warfare : Zeus Areios , Athena Areia , even Aphrodite Areia . In the Iliad , the word ares is used as a common noun synonymous with `` battle . ''   Inscriptions as early as Mycenaean times , and continuing into the Classical period , attest to Enyalios as another name for the god of war .   Character , origins , and worship   Ares was one of the Twelve Olympians in the archaic tradition represented by the Iliad and Odyssey . Zeus expresses a recurring Greek revulsion toward the god when Ares returns wounded and complaining from the battlefield at Troy :   Then looking at him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him : '' Do not sit beside me and whine , you double-faced liar.To me you are the most hateful of all gods who hold Olympus.Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart , wars and battles.…And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain , sinceyou are my child , and it was to me that your mother bore you.But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinouslong since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky .

According to the 1947 constitution , he is `` the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people . '' Historically , he is also the highest authority of the Shinto religion as he and his family are said to be the direct descendants of the sun-goddess Amaterasu , and his importance also lies in dealing with heavenly affairs , including Shinto ritual and rites throughout the nation .   In Japanese , the Emperor is called Tennō ( 天皇 ) , which means `` heavenly sovereign '' . In English , the use of the term Mikado ( 帝 ) for the Emperor was once common , but is now considered obsolete .   Currently , the Emperor of Japan is the only remaining monarch in the world reigning under the title of `` Emperor '' . The Imperial House of Japan is the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world . In the Kojiki or Nihon Shoki , a book of Japanese history finished in the eighth century , it is said that Japan was founded in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu . The current Emperor is Akihito . He acceded the Chrysanthemum Throne upon the death of his father , Emperor Shōwa ( Hirohito ) , in 1989 .   The role of the Emperor of Japan has historically alternated between a largely ceremonial symbolic role and that of an actual imperial ruler . Since the establishment of the first shogunate in 1192 , the Emperors of Japan have rarely taken on a role as supreme battlefield commander , unlike many Western monarchs . Japanese Emperors have nearly always been controlled by external political forces , to varying degrees . In fact , between 1192 and 1867 , the shoguns , or their shikken regents in Kamakura ( 1203–1333 ) , were the de facto rulers of Japan , although they were nominally appointed by the Emperor . After the Meiji restoration in 1867 , the Emperor was the embodiment of all sovereign power in the realm , as enshrined in the Meiji Constitution of 1889 . His current status as a figurehead dates from the 1947 Constitution .   Since the mid-nineteenth century , the Imperial Palace has been called Kyūjō ( 宮城 ) , later Kōkyo ( 皇居 ) , and is located on the former site of Edo Castle in the heart of Tokyo . Earlier , Emperors resided in Kyoto for nearly eleven centuries .   The Emperor 's Birthday ( December 23 ) is a national holiday .   Current role   Unlike most constitutional monarchies , the Emperor is not the nominal Chief Executive . Article 65 of the Constitution explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet , of which the Prime Minister is the leader . The Emperor is also not the ( ceremonial ) commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces . The Japan Self-Defense Forces Act of 1954 also explicitly vests this role with the Prime Minister .   The Emperor 's powers are limited only to important ceremonial functions . Article 4 of the Constitution stipulates that the Emperor `` shall perform only such acts in matters of state as are provided for in the Constitution and he shall not have powers related to government . '' It also stipulates that `` the advice and approval of the Cabinet shall be required for all acts of the Emperor in matters of state '' ( Article 3 ) . Article 4 also states that these duties can be delegated by the Emperor as provided for by law .   While the Emperor formally appoints the Prime Minister to office , Article 6 of the Constitution requires him to appoint the candidate `` as designated by the Diet '' , without specifically giving the Emperor the right to decline appointment .   Article 6 of the Constitution delegates the Emperor the following ceremonial roles :  # Appointment of the Prime Minister as designated by the Diet .  # Appointment of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as designated by the Cabinet .   The Emperor 's other duties are laid down in article 7 of the Constitution , where it is stated that the `` Emperor with the advice and approval of the Cabinet , shall perform the following acts in matters of state on behalf of the people '' :  # Promulgation of amendments of the constitution , laws , cabinet orders , and treaties .  # Convocation of the Diet .  #"], [271, "Earth ( otherwise known as the world , in Gaia , or in Latin : Terra ) is the third planet from the Sun , the densest planet in the Solar System , the largest of the Solar System 's four terrestrial planets , and the only astronomical object known to harbor life .   According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence , Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago . Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space , especially the Sun and the Moon . During one orbit around the Sun , Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times , creating 365.26 solar days or one sidereal year . Earth 's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4° away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane , producing seasonal variations on the planet 's surface within a period of one tropical year ( 365.24 solar days ) . The Moon , Earth 's only permanent natural satellite , by its gravitational relationship with Earth , causes ocean tides , stabilizes the orientation of Earth 's rotational axis , and gradually slows Earth 's rotational rate .   Earth 's lithosphere is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years . 71 % of Earth 's surface is covered with water . The remaining 29 % is land mass—consisting of continents and islands—that together has many lakes , rivers , and other sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere . The majority of Earth 's polar regions are covered in ice , including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack . Earth 's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the Earth 's magnetic field , and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics .   Within its first billion years , life appeared in Earth 's oceans , and began to affect the atmosphere and surface , leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms . Since then , the combination of Earth 's distance from the Sun , physical properties , and geological history have allowed life to evolve and today thrive . The earliest undisputed life on Earth arose at least 3.5 billion years ago . Earlier physical evidence of life includes biogenic graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in southwestern Greenland , as well as `` remains of biotic life '' found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia . Except when interrupted by mass extinction events , Earth 's biodiversity has continually expanded . Although scholars estimate that over 99 % of all species of life ( over five billion ) that ever lived on Earth are today extinct , there are an estimated 10–14 million species still in existence , of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 % have not yet been described . More recently , in May 2016 , scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described . In July 2016 , scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the Last Universal Common Ancestor ( LUCA ) of all organisms living on Earth . Over 7.3 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and minerals for their survival . Earth 's human population is divided among about 200 sovereign states that interact through diplomacy , conflict , travel , trade , and communication media .   Name and etymology   The modern English word Earth developed from a wide variety of Middle English forms , which derived from an Old English noun most often spelled '.Oxford English Dictionary , `` earth , n.¹ '' Oxford University Press ( Oxford ) , 2010 . It has cognates in every Germanic language , and their proto-Germanic root has been reconstructed as * erþō . In its earliest appearances , eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin ' and Greek ( gē ) : the ground , its soil , dry land , the human world , the surface of the world ( including the sea ) , and the globe itself . As with Terra and Gaia , Earth was a personified goddess in Germanic paganism : the Angles were listed by Tacitus as among the devotees of Nerthus , and later Norse mythology included Jörð , a giantess often given as the mother of Thor .   Originally , earth was written in lowercase , and from early Middle English , its definite sense as `` the globe '' was expressed as the earth .

The advertisements were designed by the Doyle Dane Bernbach ad agency , with the goal of distinguishing 100 % -Colombian coffee from coffee blended with beans from other countries . He typically appears with his mule Conchita , carrying sacks of harvested coffee beans . He has become an icon for Colombia as well as coffee in general , and Juan Valdez 's iconic appearance is frequently mimicked or parodied in television and other media .   The Juan Valdez character is used as an ingredient brand , to specifically denote coffee beans that are only grown and harvested in Colombia . Part of the advertising campaign includes convincing consumers that there are specific benefits of Colombian-grown and harvested coffee beans , `` including how soil components , altitude , varieties and harvesting methods create good flavor . '' The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia is entirely owned and controlled by Colombia 's coffee farmers , ( cafeteros ) which number over 500,000 people .   History   Juan Valdez was initially portrayed by José F. Duval in both print advertisements and on television until 1969 . José Duval died in 1993 at the age of 72 .   Juan Valdez had been embodied by Carlos Sánchez since 1969 and voiced by Norman Rose . Sánchez played Valdez in a brief sequence in the 2003 comedy film Bruce Almighty . In 2006 , Sánchez announced his retirement , and Carlos Castañeda , a grower from the town of Andes , Antioquia , was selected by the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia as the new face of Juan Valdez .   Brand   There were 238 Juan Valdez coffee shops in 2013 , 135 in Colombia and 35 shops in other countries . Juan Valdez brand coffee is available in Chile , Costa Rica , Aruba , Ecuador , El Salvador , Panama , Spain , Kuwait , and the United States at supermarkets and Juan Valdez coffee shops .   Controversies   The name `` Juan Valdez '' is by no means unique , as both Juan and Valdez are common Spanish-language names and there are possibly thousands of men with this name alive today ( although the Valdez name is hardly known in the coffee growing regions of Colombia ) ; this became relevant in a 2006 lawsuit over the phrase `` Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee '' .   The National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia sued cartoonist Mike Peters , creator of Mother Goose & Grimm , for a cartoon talking about Juan Valdez and Colombian coffee in January 2009 . In a weeklong series making fun of various commercial products , he referenced violence in Colombia by having a character say : `` Y'know , there 's a big crime syndicate in Colombia . So when they say there 's a little bit of Juan Valdez in every can , maybe they 're not kidding . '' The lawsuit was dropped after Mr. Peters apologized publicly .

October 19 ] 1735 – July 4 , 1826 ) was an American lawyer , author , statesman , and diplomat . He served as the second President of the United States ( 1797–1801 ) , the first Vice President ( 1789–97 ) , and as a Founding Father was a leader of American independence from Great Britain . Adams was a political theorist in the Age of Enlightenment who promoted republicanism and a strong central government . His innovative ideas were frequently published . He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent , particularly with his wife and key advisor Abigail .   He collaborated with his cousin , revolutionary leader Samuel Adams , but he established his own prominence prior to the American Revolution . After the Boston Massacre , despite severe local anti-British sentiment , he provided a successful though unpopular legal defense of the accused British soldiers , driven by his devotion to the right to counsel and the Presumption of innocence| '' protect [ ion ] of innocence '' . As a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress , Adams played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence . He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , and was its foremost advocate in the Congress . As a diplomat in Europe , he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain , and acquired vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers . Adams was the primary author of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 which influenced American political theory , as did his earlier Thoughts on Government ( 1776 ) .   Adams ' credentials as a revolutionary secured for him two terms as President George Washington 's vice president ( 1789 to 1797 ) and also his own election in 1796 as the second president . In his single term as president , he encountered fierce criticism from the Jeffersonian Republicans , as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party , led by his rival Alexander Hamilton . Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts , and built up the army and navy in the face of an undeclared naval `` Quasi-War '' with France . The major accomplishment of his presidency was a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton 's opposition . Due to his strong posture on defense , Adams is `` often called the father of the American Navy '' . He was the first U.S. president to reside in the executive mansion , now known as the White House .   In 1800 , Adams lost re-election to Thomas Jefferson , and retired to Massachusetts . He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson upon the latter 's own retirement by initiating a correspondence which lasted fourteen years . He and his wife established a family of politicians , diplomats , and historians now referred to as the Adams political family . Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams , the sixth President of the United States . He died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence . Modern historians in the aggregate have ranked his administration favorably .   Early life and education   Childhood   John Adams was born on October 30 , 1735 ( October 19 , 1735 Old Style , Julian calendar ) , to John Adams Sr. ( 1691–1761 ) and Susanna Boylston ( 1708–1797 ) . He had two younger brothers , Peter and Elihu . Adams ' birthplace was then in Braintree , Massachusetts ( now Quincy , Massachusetts ) , and is preserved at Adams National Historical Park . Adams ' mother was from a leading medical family of current Brookline , Massachusetts . His father was a Congregationalist deacon , a farmer , a cordwainer , and a lieutenant in the militia . He further served as a selectman ( town councilman ) and supervised the building of schools and roads . Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship . His paternal great-grandfather David Adams was born and bred at `` Fferm Penybanc '' , Llanboidy , Carmarthenshire , North Wales . He emigrated from Wales in 1675 and sixty years later his great-grandson , John Adams , was born .   Though raised in modest surroundings , Adams felt an acute responsibility to live up to his family 's heritage of reverence . He was a direct descendent of Puritans , who came to the American wilderness in the 1630s , established a colonial presence in America , and profoundly affected the culture , laws , and traditions of their region ."], [274, "William Simpson `` Bill '' Fraser ( 5 June 1908 – 9 September 1987 ) was a Scottish actor who appeared on stage , screen and television for many years . In 1986 he won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Comedy Performance for his stage role in the play When We Are Married .   Early life   Fraser was born in Perth , Scotland and educated at Strathallan School . He began his career as a clerk in a bank before moving on to acting . In the early days when acting work was scarce , Fraser was often penniless , frequently sleeping rough on the Embankment in London . Before World War II he ran the Connaught Theatre in Worthing ; when called up he served in a Royal Air Force Special Liaison Unit , reaching the rank of flight lieutenant , where he met and became friends with Eric Sykes . Just after the war a chance meeting in a London street led to Fraser 's giving Sykes his first work as a writer for radio comedy and the two friends worked together many times over the following years . Fraser is also credited with giving Peter Cushing his first acting job   Career   Fraser often played irascible or belligerent characters on screen and had many roles as a policeman , soldier or judge . His first television appearance was on The Tony Hancock Show in 1956 , after which he became a regular actor on Hancock 's Half Hour . He then joined The Army Game as Sgt Claude Snudge , which led to a sequel called Bootsie and Snudge . He also played Snudge in the 1964 series Foreign Affairs . Later comedic roles included parts in the TV dramatisation of The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole , Aged 13¾ as well as Ripping Yarns , The Train Now Standing , The Corn is Green and Father , Dear Father .   He also appeared in the comedy films The Amorous Milkman and Doctor at Large ; the big-screen version of Love Thy Neighbour ; and the Frankie Howerd trilogy Up Pompeii ! , Up the Front and Up the Chastity Belt .   He had a recurring role on Rumpole of the Bailey as Judge Roger Bullingham , an unsympathetic judge privately nicknamed `` the Mad Bull '' by defence barrister Horace Rumpole .   Fraser 's straight parts included Boanerges in The Apple Cart and Eddie Waters in Comedians , both for the BBC , and appearances on The Professionals and The Avengers . He also starred in the Doctor Who story Meglos in 1980 , and appeared in the spin-off show K-9 and Company the following year . In the early 80s he was in two series of a straight drama on BBC1 , Flesh and Blood ; his performance in its first episode of an industrialist sitting at the bedside of his dying wife was regarded by many as a tour de force .   He appeared as Mr Micawber in the TV dramatisation of David Copperfield in 1966 . He played Serjeant Buzzfuzz in the TV musical Pickwick for the BBC in 1969 ; and his last role was as Mr Casby in the 1988 screened production of Little Dorrit .   Fraser also appeared in an early advertisement for the Austin Metro . In 1985 he was cast as Bert Baxter in The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole .   During those periods when Fraser was not acting , he ran a small sweetshop and tobacconists at Ilford Lane in Ilford , Essex .   Bill Fraser played husband to Googie Withers in the Chichester Theatre production of Maugham 's The Circle . It transferred to the West End and played at the Haymarket , and then toured England . The cast included Susan Hampshire and John McCallum ( Googie Withers ' husband ) .

Selected filmography"], [275, "Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter ( the others being solid , liquid , and plasma ) . A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms ( e.g . a noble gas like neon ) , elemental molecules made from one type of atom ( e.g . oxygen ) , or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms ( e.g . carbon dioxide ) . A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air . What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles . This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer . The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image . One type of commonly known gas is steam .   The gaseous state of matter is found between the liquid and plasma states , the latter of which provides the upper temperature boundary for gases . Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention . High-density atomic gases super cooled to incredibly low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either a Bose gas or a Fermi gas . For a comprehensive listing of these exotic states of matter see list of states of matter .   Elemental gases   The only chemical elements which are stable multi atom homonuclear molecules at standard temperature and pressure ( STP ) , are hydrogen ( H2 ) , nitrogen ( N2 ) and oxygen ( O2 ) ;  plus two halogens , fluorine ( F2 ) and chlorine ( Cl2 ) .  These gases , when grouped together with the monatomic noble gases ; which are helium ( He ) , neon ( Ne ) , argon ( Ar ) , krypton ( Kr ) , xenon ( Xe ) and radon ( Rn ) ; are called `` elemental gases '' . Alternatively they are sometimes known as `` molecular gases '' to distinguish them from molecules that are also chemical compounds .   Etymology   The word gas is a neologism first used by the early 17th-century Flemish chemist J.B. van Helmont . Van Helmont 's word appears to have been simply a phonetic transcription of the Greek word χάος Chaos – the g in Dutch being pronounced like ch in `` loch '' – in which case Van Helmont was simply following the established alchemical usage first attested in the works of Paracelsus . According to Paracelsus 's terminology , chaos meant something like `` ultra-rarefied water '' .   An alternative story is that Van Helmont 's word is corrupted from gahst ( or geist ) , signifying a ghost or spirit . This was because certain gases suggested a supernatural origin , such as from their ability to cause death , extinguish flames , and to occur in `` mines , bottom of wells , churchyards and other lonely places '' .   Physical characteristics   Because most gases are difficult to observe directly , they are described through the use of four physical properties or macroscopic characteristics : pressure , volume , number of particles ( chemists group them by moles ) and temperature . These four characteristics were repeatedly observed by scientists such as Robert Boyle , Jacques Charles , John Dalton , Joseph Gay-Lussac and Amedeo Avogadro for a variety of gases in various settings . Their detailed studies ultimately led to a mathematical relationship among these properties expressed by the ideal gas law ( see simplified models section below ) .   Gas particles are widely separated from one another , and consequently have weaker intermolecular bonds than liquids or solids . These intermolecular forces result from electrostatic interactions between gas particles . Like-charged areas of different gas particles repel , while oppositely charged regions of different gas particles attract one another ; gases that contain permanently charged ions are known as plasmas . Gaseous compounds with polar covalent bonds contain permanent charge imbalances and so experience relatively strong intermolecular forces , although the molecule while the compound 's net charge remains neutral . Transient , randomly induced charges exist across non-polar covalent bonds of molecules and electrostatic interactions caused by them are referred to as Van der Waals forces . The interaction of these intermolecular forces varies within a substance which determines many of the physical properties unique to each gas . A comparison of boiling points for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds leads us to this conclusion . The drifting smoke particles in"], [276, "The Prime Minister of Italy , officially the President of the Council of Ministers of the Italian Republic ( Italian : Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri della Repubblica Italiana ) , is the head of government of the Italian Republic . Prior to the establishment of the Italian Republic , the title was historically literally called `` President of the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of Italy '' ( Presidente del Consiglio dei ministri del Regno d'Italia ) . From 1925 to 1943 during the Fascist regime , the position was transformed into the dictatorial position of `` Head of the Government , Prime Minister Secretary of State '' held by Benito Mussolini , Duce of Fascism , who officially governed on the behalf of the King of Italy . King Victor Emmanuel III removed Mussolini from office in 1943 and the position was restored with Marshal Pietro Badoglio becoming Prime Minister in 1943 . Alcide De Gasperi became the first Prime Minister of the Italian Republic in 1946 .   The prime minister is the President of the Council of Ministers—which holds effective executive power— and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities . The office is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems , but the leader of the Italian government is not authorized to request the dissolution of the Parliament of Italy .   Another difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers . By virtue of that , the Prime Minister has exclusive power to : Coordinate intelligence policies , determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security ; Apply and protect State secrets ; Authorize agents to carry out operations , in Italy or abroad , in violation of the law .   The office was established by Articles 92 through to 96 of the current Constitution of Italy . The prime minister is appointed by the President of the Republic after each general election . Commonly referred to in Italy as premier , the right title of the office holder is Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri , or just Presidente del Consiglio . The formal Italian order of precedence lists the office as being ceremonially the fourth most important Italian state office .   Functions   In addition to powers inherent in being a member of the cabinet , the prime minister holds specific powers , most notably being able to nominate a list of cabinet ministers to be appointed by the President of the Republic and the countersigning of all legislative instruments having the force of law that are signed by the President of the Republic .   Article 95 of the Italian constitution provides that `` the prime minister directs and coordinates the activity of the ministers '' . This power has been used to a quite variable extent in the history of the Italian state , as it is strongly influenced by the political strength of individual ministers and thus by the parties they represent .   Often the Prime Minister 's activity consists more in mediating between the various parties in the majority coalition , rather than directing the activity of the Council of Ministers . The Prime Minister 's supervisory power is further limited by the lack of any formal authority to fire ministers , although a cabinet reshuffle ( rimpasto ) , or sometimes even an 'individual vote of no confidence ' on the part of Parliament , may in practice provide a surrogate measure .   As the `` President of the Council of Ministers '' the modern Prime Minister leads the Cabinet ( the Council of Minister ) . In addition the Prime Minister leads a major political party and generally commands the majority in the Parliament .   History   The office was first established in 1848 in Italy 's predecessor state , the Kingdom of Sardinia—although it was not mentioned in the constitution , the Albertine Statute . From 1848 to 1861 ten Prime Ministers governed the kingdom , most of them being right-wing politicians .   Historical Right and Historical Left   After the Unification of Italy and the establishment of the kingdom , the procedure did not change . In fact the candidate for office was appointed by the king , and presided over a very unstable political system . The first President of the Council was Camillo Benso di Cavour , who was appointed on 23 March 1861 , but he died on the 6th of June the same year .

The film is about a young man who receives a strange creature called a mogwai as a pet , which then spawns other creatures who transform into small , destructive , evil monsters . This story was continued with a sequel , Gremlins 2 : The New Batch , released in 1990 . Unlike the lighter sequel , Gremlins opts for more black comedy , balanced against a Christmastime setting . Both films were the center of large merchandising campaigns .   Steven Spielberg was the film 's executive producer and the screenplay was written by Chris Columbus . The film stars Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates , with Howie Mandel providing the voice of Gizmo , the main mogwai character . Gremlins was a commercial success and received positive reviews from critics . However , the film was also heavily criticized for some of its more violent sequences . In response to this and to similar complaints about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , Spielberg suggested that the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) alter its rating system , which it did within two months of the film 's release .   Plot   Randall Peltzer , a struggling inventor , visits a Chinatown antique store in the hope to find a Christmas present for his son Billy . In the store , Randall encounters a small , furry creature called a mogwai ( Cantonese : 魔怪 , `` monster '' ) . The owner Mr. Wing refuses to sell the creature to Randall , though his grandson secretly sells the mogwai to Randall but tells him to remember three important rules that must never be broken – do not expose the mogwai to bright lights or sunlight which will kill it , do not let it get wet , and never feed it after midnight .   Randall returns home to Kingston Falls where he gives the mogwai to Billy as a pet . Billy works in the local bank , and fears his dog Barney will be put down by Mrs. Deagle . Randall names the mogwai “ Gizmo ” and Billy makes sure to treat him well . But when Billy ’ s friend Pete spills a glass of water over Gizmo , five more mogwai spawn from his back , a more troublemaking sort led by the aggressive Stripe . Billy shows one of the mogwai to his former science teacher Mr. Hanson , spawning another mogwai , who Hanson experiments on . Stripe ’ s gang trick Billy into feeding them after midnight by chewing out the power cord to his bedside clock and transform into cocoons , as does Hanson ’ s mogwai . Shortly after , their cocoons hatch and they emerge as mischievous , reptilian Gremlins that torture Gizmo and try to murder Billy ’ s mother , while Hanson is killed by his Gremlin .   All of the Gremlins are killed except Stripe , who escapes to a local YMCA and jumps into a swimming pool , spawning an army of Gremlins who wreak massive chaos around Kingston Falls . Billy tries to warn the police but they don ’ t believe him . Many people are injured or outright killed by the Gremlins ’ rampage , including Mrs. Deagle , who is launched out of her house on a stair lift that has been sabotaged by the gremlins . At the local bar , the Gremlins have fun until the barmaid Kate Beringer , Billy ’ s girlfriend , flashes them with a camera and escapes into the bank with Billy and Gizmo . While hiding , she reveals her father died in a chimney while dressed as Santa Claus . Billy and Kate discover the town has fallen silent and the Gremlins are watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in a theater . They set off an explosion , killing all the Gremlins except Stripe .   Billy chases Stripe into a Montgomery Ward store , where Stripe climbs into a water fountain and tries to spawn more Gremlins . Gizmo arrives in a toy car and opens a skylight , exposing Stripe to extreme sunlight and melting him . In the aftermath of the Gremlins ’ rampage , Mr. Wing appears to collect Gizmo , scolding the Peltzers for their carelessness , thinking the Western world is not ready but comments that Billy might some day be ready to care for Gizmo properly . Gizmo likewise believes so , having become attached to Billy .

He remains the only person to set both world land and water speed records in the same year ( 1964 ) .   Family and personal life   Donald Campbell was born at Canbury House , Kingston upon Thames , Surrey , the son of Malcolm , later Sir Malcolm Campbell , holder of 13 world speed records in the 1920s and 30s in the Bluebird cars and boats , and his second wife , Dorothy Evelyn Whittall .   Campbell attended St Peter 's School , Seaford and Uppingham School . At the outbreak of the Second World War he volunteered for the Royal Air Force , but was unable to serve because of a case of childhood rheumatic fever . He joined Briggs Motor Bodies Ltd in West Thurrock , where he became a maintenance engineer . Subsequently , he was a shareholder in a small engineering company called Kine engineering , producing machine tools . Following his father 's death on New Year 's Eve , 31 December 1948 and aided by Malcolm 's chief engineer , Leo Villa , the younger Campbell strove to set speed records first on water and then land .   He married three times : to Daphne Harvey in 1945 , producing daughter Georgina ( Gina ) Campbell , born on 19 September 1949 ; to Dorothy McKegg in 1952 ; and to Tonia Bern in December 1958 , which lasted until his death in 1967 . Campbell was intensely superstitious , hating the colour green , the number thirteen and believing nothing good ever happened on a Friday . He also had some interest in the paranormal , which he nurtured as a member of the Ghost Club .   Campbell was a restless man and seemed driven to emulate , if not surpass , his father 's achievements . He was generally light-hearted and was generally , at least until his 1960 crash at the Bonneville Salt Flats , optimistic in his outlook .   Behind the public façade of speed king , he was a complex character – proud and vulnerable , increasingly anxious about his place in the world . Campbell was a great patriot and saw his achievements as being for the greater good of Britain .   Water speed records   Campbell began his speed record attempts in the summer of 1949 , using his father 's old boat , Blue Bird K4 , which he renamed Bluebird K4 . His initial attempts that summer were unsuccessful , although he did come close to raising his father 's existing record . The team returned to Coniston Water , Lancashire in 1950 for further trials . While there , they heard that an American , Stanley Sayers , had raised the record from 141 to , beyond K4 's capabilities without substantial modification .   Over the winter of 1950 to 1951 , Bluebird K4 was modified to make it a 'prop-rider ' as opposed to her original immersed propeller configuration . This greatly reduced hydrodynamic drag as the third planing point would now be the propeller hub , meaning one of the two propeller blades was always out of the water at high speed . She now sported two cockpits , the second one being for Leo Villa .   Bluebird K4 now had a chance of exceeding Sayers ' record and also enjoyed success as a circuit racer , winning the Oltranza Cup in Italy in the spring of that year . Returning to Coniston in September , they finally got Bluebird up to 170 mph after further trials , only to suffer a structural failure at 170 mph which wrecked the boat . Sayers raised the record the following year to 178 mph in Slo-Mo-Shun IV .   Along with Campbell , Britain had another potential contender for Water Speed Record honours - John Cobb . He had commissioned the world 's first purpose-built turbojet Hydroplane , Crusader , with a target speed of over 200 mph , and began trials on Loch Ness in autumn 1952 . Cobb was killed later that year , when Crusader broke up , during an attempt on the record . Campbell was devastated at Cobb 's loss , but he resolved to build a new Bluebird boat to bring the WSR back to Britain .   In early 1953 , Campbell began development of his own advanced all-metal jet-powered Bluebird K7 hydroplane to challenge the record , by now held"], [279, "A nymph ( , nymphē ) in Greek mythology and in Latin mythology is a minor female nature deity typically associated with a particular location or landform . Different from other goddesses , nymphs are generally regarded as divine spirits who animate nature , and are usually depicted as beautiful , young nubile maidens who love to dance and sing ; their amorous freedom sets them apart from the restricted and chaste wives and daughters of the Greek polis . They are beloved by many and dwell in mountainous regions and forests by lakes and streams . Although they would never die of old age nor illness , and could give birth to fully immortal children if mated to a god , they themselves were not necessarily immortal , and could be beholden to death in various forms . Charybdis and Scylla were once nymphs .   Other nymphs , always in the shape of young maidens , were part of the retinue of a god , such as Dionysus , Hermes , or Pan , or a goddess , generally the huntress Artemis . Nymphs were the frequent target of satyrs .   Etymology   Nymphs are personifications of the creative and fostering activities of nature , most often identified with the life-giving outflow of springs : as Walter Burkert ( Burkert 1985 : III.3.3 ) remarks , `` The idea that rivers are gods and springs divine nymphs is deeply rooted not only in poetry but in belief and ritual ; the worship of these deities is limited only by the fact that they are inseparably identified with a specific locality . ''   The Greek word has `` bride '' and `` veiled '' among its meanings : hence a marriageable young woman . Other readers refer the word ( and also Latin nubere and German Knospe ) to a root expressing the idea of `` swelling '' ( according to Hesychius , one of the meanings of is `` rose-bud '' ) .   Adaptations   The Greek nymphs were spirits invariably bound to places , not unlike the Latin genius loci , and the difficulty of transferring their cult may be seen in the complicated myth that brought Arethusa to Sicily . In the works of the Greek-educated Latin poets , the nymphs gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous Italian divinities of springs and streams ( Juturna , Egeria , Carmentis , Fontus ) , while the Lymphae ( originally Lumpae ) , Italian water-goddesses , owing to the accidental similarity of their names , could be identified with the Greek Nymphae . The mythologies of classicizing Roman poets were unlikely to have affected the rites and cult of individual nymphs venerated by country people in the springs and clefts of Latium . Among the Roman literate class , their sphere of influence was restricted , and they appear almost exclusively as divinities of the watery element .   In modern Greek folklore   The ancient Greek belief in nymphs survived in many parts of the country into the early years of the twentieth century , when they were usually known as `` nereids '' . At that time , John Cuthbert Lawson wrote : `` ... there is probably no nook or hamlet in all Greece where the womenfolk at least do not scrupulously take precautions against the thefts and malice of the nereids , while many a man may still be found to recount in all good faith stories of their beauty , passion and caprice .   `` Nor is it a matter of faith only ; more than once I have been in villages where certain Nereids were known by sight to several persons ( so at least they averred ) ; and there was a wonderful agreement among the witnesses in the description of their appearance and dress . ''   Nymphs tended to frequent areas distant from humans but could be encountered by lone travelers outside the village , where their music might be heard , and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool , either during the noon heat or in the middle of the night . They might appear in a whirlwind . Such encounters could be dangerous , bringing dumbness , besotted infatuation , madness or stroke to the unfortunate human . When parents believed their child to be nereid-struck , they would pray to Saint Artemidos .   Modern sexual connotations   Due to the depiction of the mythological nymphs as females who mate with men or women at their own volition , and are completely outside of male control , the term is often"], [280, "The European Union ( EU ) is a politico-economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe . It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million . The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states . EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people , goods , services , and capital within the internal market , enact legislation in justice and home affairs , and maintain common policies on trade , agriculture , fisheries , and regional development . Within the Schengen Area , passport controls have been abolished . A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002 , and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency .   The EU operates through a hybrid system of supranational and intergovernmental decision-making . The seven principal decision-making bodies—known as the institutions of the European Union—are the European Council , the Council of the European Union , the European Parliament , the European Commission , the Court of Justice of the European Union , the European Central Bank , and the European Court of Auditors .   The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) and the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , formed by the Inner Six countries in 1951 and 1958 , respectively . The community and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit . While no member state has , as yet , ever left the EU , a non-binding referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016 supported leaving . The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union in 1993 and introduced European citizenship . The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU , the Treaty of Lisbon , came into force in 2009 .   Covering 7.3 % of the world population , the EU in 2014 generated a nominal gross domestic product ( GDP ) of 18.495 trillion US dollars , constituting approximately 24 % of global nominal GDP and 17 % when measured in terms of purchasing power parity . Additionally , 26 out of 28 EU countries have a very high Human Development Index , according to the United Nations Development Program . In 2012 , the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy , the EU has developed a role in external relations and defence . The union maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations , the World Trade Organization , the G8 , and the G-20 . Because of its global influence , the European Union has been described as a current or as a potential superpower .   History   Preliminary ( 194557 )   After World War II , European integration was seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which had devastated the continent . The 1948 Hague Congress was a pivotal moment in European federal history , as it led to the creation of the European Movement International and of the College of Europe , where Europe 's future leaders would live and study together . 1952 saw the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community , which was declared to be `` a first step in the federation of Europe . '' The supporters of the Community included Alcide De Gasperi , Jean Monnet , Robert Schuman , and Paul-Henri Spaak .   Treaty of Rome ( 195792 )   In 1957 , Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome , which created the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and established a customs union . They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community ( Euratom ) for co-operation in developing nuclear energy . Both treaties came into force in 1958 .   The EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC , although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly . The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein ( Hallstein Commission ) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand ( Armand Commission ) and then Étienne Hirsch . Euratom was to integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union among members .   Through the 1960s , tensions began to show , with France seeking to limit supranational power . Nevertheless , in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a"], [281, "The White Ship ( ) was a vessel that sank in the English Channel near the Normandy coast off Barfleur , on 25 November 1120 . Only two of those aboard survived.William of Malmesbury stated one rustic survived while Orderic Vitalis identified two survivors , a butcher and a Geoffrey , the son of Gilbert de l'Aigle . Compare : J.A . Guiles , William of Malmesbury 's Chronicle of the Kings of England ( London : George Bell and Sons , 1904 ) , p. 456 , and Ordericus Vitalis , The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy , Trans . Thomas Forester , Vol IV ( London : Henry G. Bohn , 1856 ) , p. 35 . Those who drowned included William Adelin , the only surviving legitimate son and heir of King Henry I of England . William Adelin 's death led to a succession crisis and a period of civil war in England known as the Anarchy .   Shipwreck   The White Ship was a newly-refitted vessel captained by Thomas FitzStephen , whose father Stephen FitzAirard had been captain of the ship Mora for William the Conqueror when he invaded England in 1066 . Thomas offered his ship to Henry I of England to use it to return to England from Barfleur in Normandy . Henry had already made other arrangements , but allowed many in his retinue to take the White Ship , including his heir , William Adelin ; his illegitimate son Richard of Lincoln ; his illegitimate daughter Matilda FitzRoy , Countess of Perche ; and many other nobles . According to chronicler Orderic Vitalis , the crew asked William Adelin for wine and he supplied it to them in great abundance . By the time the ship was ready to leave there were about 300 people on board although some had disembarked before the ship sailed due to the excessive drinking .   The ship 's captain , Thomas FitzStephen , was ordered by the revellers to overtake the king 's ship which had already sailed . The White Ship was fast , of the best construction and had recently been fitted with new materials which made the captain and crew confident they could reach England first . But when it set off in the dark , its port side struck a submerged rock called Quillebœuf and the ship quickly capsized . William Adelin got into a small boat and could have escaped but turned back to try to rescue his half-sister , Matilda , when he heard her cries for help . His boat was swamped by others trying to save themselves , and William drowned along with them . According to Orderic Vitalis only two survived by clinging to the rock all night ; one was a butcher from Rouen , the second was Geoffrey de l'Aigle . The chronicler further claimed that when Thomas FitzStephen came to the surface after the sinking and learned that William Adelin had not survived , he let himself drown rather than face the King .   One legend holds that the ship was doomed because priests were not allowed to board it in the customary manner.William of Nangis wrote that the White Ship sank because all the men aboard were sodomites . See : ’ ’ Chron. ’ ’ in Rolls series , ed . W. Stubbs ( London , 1879 ) , vol . 2 , under A.D. 1120. which reflects the medieval belief that sin caused pestilence and disaster . See also : Codex Justinian , nov. 141 . Another theory is expounded by Victoria Chandler , `` The Wreck of the White Ship '' , in The final argument : the imprint of violence on society in medieval and early modern Europe , edited by Donald J. Kagay and L.J . Andrew Villalon ( 1998 ) . Her theory discusses the possibility of it being a mass murder .   Repercussions   A direct result of William Adelin 's death was the period known as the Anarchy . The White Ship disaster had left Henry I with only one legitimate child , a second daughter named Matilda . Although Henry I had forced his barons to swear an oath to support Matilda as his heir on several occasions , a woman had never ruled in England in her own right . Matilda was also unpopular because she was married to Geoffrey V , Count of Anjou , a traditional enemy of England 's Norman nobles . Upon Henry 's death in 1135 , the English barons were reluctant to accept Matilda as queen Regnant .

Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on July 20 , 1969 , at 20:18 UTC . Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours later on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC ; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later . They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft , and collected of lunar material for return to Earth . The third crew member , Michael Collins , piloted the Command Module Columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon 's surface . Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rendezvousing with Columbia in lunar orbit .   Launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island , Florida , on July 16 , Apollo 11 was the fifth manned mission of NASA 's Apollo program . The Apollo spacecraft had three parts : a Command Module ( CM ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that landed back on Earth ; a Service Module ( SM ) , which supported the Command Module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a Lunar Module ( LM ) that had two stages – a lower stage for landing on the Moon , and an upper stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . After being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V 's upper stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit . Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the Lunar Module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility . They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface . The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the Command Module . They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth . They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 .   Broadcast on live TV to a world-wide audience , Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as `` one small step for [ a ] man , one giant leap for mankind . '' Apollo 11 effectively ended the Space Race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by the U.S. President John F. Kennedy in a speech before the U.S. Congress : `` before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth . ''   Framework   Crew   Apollo 11 was the second all-veteran multi-person crew ( the first being Apollo 10 ) in human spaceflight history . A previous solo veteran flight had been made on Soyuz 1 in 1967 by Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov .   Collins was originally slated to be the Command Module Pilot ( CMP ) on Apollo 8 but was removed when he required surgery on his back and was replaced by Jim Lovell , his backup for that flight . After Collins was medically cleared , he took what would have been Lovell 's spot on Apollo 11 ; as a veteran of Apollo 8 , Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11 's backup crew and promoted to backup commander .   Backup crew   In early 1969 , Anders accepted a job with the National Space Council effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date . At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup Command Module Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch ( at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed ) and would later join Lovell 's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original Apollo 13 CMP .

Starring in the lead role and using his own singing voice for the musical numbers , Kevin Spacey co-wrote , directed , and co-produced the film , which takes its title from Darin 's hit version of the song of the same name .   Beyond the Sea depicts Darin 's rise to success in both the music and film industry during the 1950s and 1960s , as well as his marriage to Sandra Dee , portrayed by Kate Bosworth .   As early as 1986 , Barry Levinson intended to direct a film based on the life of Darin , and he began pre-production on the project in early 1997 . When he eventually vacated the director 's position , Spacey , along with Darin 's son Dodd , acquired the film rights .   Beyond the Sea was released in December 2004 to mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box office . Dodd Darin , Sandra Dee and former Darin manager Steve Blauner responded with enthusiastic feedback to Spacey 's work on the film . Despite a number of negative reviews , some critics praised Spacey 's performance , largely due to his decision to use his own singing voice . He received a Golden Globe nomination .   Plot   Rather than providing a straightforward biography , the film weaves fantasy sequences with scenes containing somewhat fictionalized accounts of events in Darin 's life , and throughout it , the adult singer interacts with his younger self . It chronicles his determination to rise from his working class roots as Walden Robert Cassotto , a frail Bronx boy plagued by multiple bouts of rheumatic fever , and become a singer more famous than Frank Sinatra . To achieve that goal , he forms a band and struggles to find gigs at any nightclub that will hire him .   His agent gets Darin a recording contract with Atlantic Records , where the singer enjoys teen idol success with `` Splish Splash '' . Not wanting to limit his appeal to rock and roll audiences , he changes his niche to big band singing and records major hits , such as `` Mack the Knife .

To his actress wife 's chagrin , Darin is nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as a shell shocked soldier in Captain Newman , M.D ..   In the late 1960s , Darin becomes involved in the campaign to elect Robert F. Kennedy for President and contemplates a political career of his own . His sister Nina , knowing his past will be investigated closely if Bobby opts to enter the political arena , shocks him with the news his beloved mother actually was his grandmother and he is Nina 's illegitimate child , the son of a father she can not identify .

The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal , Quebec , by Canadian Chris Haney , a photo editor for Montreal 's The Gazette , and Scott Abbott , a sports editor for The Canadian Press . After finding pieces of their Scrabble game missing , they decided to create their own game . With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner , they completed development of the game , which was released in 1982 .   In North America , the game 's popularity peaked in 1984 , a year in which over 20 million games were sold . The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982 , then to Parker Brothers ( now part of Hasbro ) in 1988 , after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group ; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights , for US $ 80 million . , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages . Northern Plastics of Elroy , Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985 . In December 1993 , Trivial Pursuit was named to the `` Games Hall of Fame '' by Games magazine . An online version of Trivial Pursuit was launched in September 2003 .   Dozens of question sets have been released for the game . The question cards are organized into themes ; for instance , in the standard Genus question set , questions in green deal with science and nature . Some question sets have been designed for younger players , and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins ( such as Star Wars , Saturday Night Live , and The Lord of the Rings movies ) .   Gameplay   The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions . Questions are split into six categories , with each one having its own color to readily identify itself ; in the classic version of Trivial Pursuit , these are Geography ( blue ) , Entertainment ( pink ) , History ( yellow ) , Arts & Literature ( originally brown , later purple ) , Science & Nature ( green ) , and Sports & Leisure ( orange ) . The game includes a board , playing pieces , question cards , a box , small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces , and a die .   Playing pieces used in Trivial Pursuit are round and divided into six sections , similar to a pie . A small plastic wedge , sometimes called cheese , can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player 's progress .   During the game , players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes . This track is divided into spaces of different colors , and the center of the board is a hexagonal `` hub '' space . At the end of each spoke is a `` category headquarters '' space . When a player 's counter lands on a square , the player answers a question according to the color of the square , which corresponds to one of the six categories . If the player answers the question correctly , their turn continues ; if the player 's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces , he/she collect a wedge of the same color , which fits into the playing piece . Some spaces say `` roll again , '' giving an extra roll of the die to the player . The hub is a `` wild '' space ; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his/her choice . Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time . A variant rule ends a player 's turn on collecting a wedge , preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board .   Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his/her playing piece , he or she must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players . If this question is answered correctly , that player wins the game . Otherwise , the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn .

( one of the few times Fudd bested Bugs , though he felt bad about it ) , the Rossini parody Rabbit of Seville , and the `` Hunting Trilogy '' of `` Rabbit Season/Duck Season '' shorts ( Rabbit Fire , Rabbit Seasoning , and Duck ! Rabbit , Duck ! ) with Fudd , Bugs Bunny , and Daffy Duck . An earlier character named Egghead set some of Elmer 's characteristics before the character 's most famous trademarks were set .   Egghead   Tex Avery introduced a new character in his cartoon short Egghead Rides Again , released July 17 , 1937 . [ http : //toonopedia.com/egghead.htm Egghead ] at Don Markstein 's Toonopedia . [ http : //www.webcitation.org/6iJt7bcDH Archived ] from the original on June 16 , 2016 . Egghead initially was depicted as having a bulbous nose , funny/eccentric clothing , a voice like Joe Penner ( provided either by radio mimic Danny Webb or actor Cliff Nazarro ) and an egg-shaped head . Many cartoon historians believe that Egghead evolved into Elmer over a period of a couple of years . However , animation historian Michael Barrier asserts , `` The Egghead-Elmer story is actually a little messy , my sense being that most of the people involved , whether they were making the films or publicizing them , not only had trouble telling the characters apart but had no idea why they should bother trying . '' Egghead made his second appearance in 1937 's Little Red Walking Hood and then in 1938 teamed with Warner Bros. ' newest cartoon star Daffy Duck in Daffy Duck and Egghead . Egghead continued to make appearances in the Warner cartoons in 1938 , such as in The Isle of Pingo Pongo and A-Lad-In Bagdad . In A Feud There Was ( 1938 ) , Egghead made his entrance riding a motor scooter with the words `` Elmer Fudd , Peacemaker '' displayed on the side , the first onscreen use of that name . Egghead shifts from having a Moe Howard haircut to being bald , and wears a brown derby , a baggy suit , and a high-collared shirt . Egghead returned decades later in the compilation film Daffy Duck 's Quackbusters . More recently , he also made a cameo appearance at the end of Looney Tunes : Back in Action and was also given in his own story , which starred him alongside Pete Puma , in the Looney Tunes comic book .   One animation history suggests that the Egghead character was based on Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! cartoonist and entertainer Robert Ripley , while the name Elmer Fudd might have been a reference to the then-popular hunter Elmer Keith .   Egghead has the distinction of being the first recurring character created for Leon Schlesinger 's Merrie Melodies series ( to be followed by such characters as Sniffles , Inki , and even Bugs Bunny ) , which had previously contained only one-shot characters , although during the Harman-Ising era , Foxy , Goopy Geer , and Piggy each appeared in a few Merrie Melodies .   In the 1939 cartoon Dangerous Dan McFoo , a new voice actor , Arthur Q. Bryan , was hired to provide the voice of the hero dog character . It was in this cartoon that the popular `` milk-sop '' voice of Elmer Fudd was created . Elmer Fudd has since been the chief antagonistic force in the majority of the Bugs Bunny cartoons , initiating one of the most famous rivalries in the history of American cinema . Barrier notes , `` Elmer Fudd was not a modified version of his fellow Warner Bros. character Egghead '' and that `` the two characters were always distinct . That was evidenced ... by Elmer 's being identified in a Warner publicity"], [286, "Kristen Mary `` Kris '' Jenner ( née Houghton , formerly Kardashian ; born November 5 , 1955 ) is an American television personality who rose to fame for starring in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians together with her family .

Batman 's place of residence was first identified as Gotham City in Batman # 4 ( Winter 1940 ) . New York Times journalist William Safire described Gotham City as `` New York City below 14th Street , from SoHo to Greenwich Village , the Bowery , Little Italy , Chinatown , and the sinister areas around the base of the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges . '' Batman artist Neal Adams sees the 1940s mobster history of Chicago as the basis for Gotham , while other comic creators have stated that Metropolis is New York in the daytime and Gotham City is New York at night .   Locations used as inspiration or filming locations for the urban portion of Gotham City in the live-action Batman films have included Chicago , Detroit , Pittsburgh , Los Angeles , and New York City . English country house locations in Nottinghamshire , Hertfordshire , and Buckinghamshire , as well as Stevenson Taylor Hall in New York , have been used to depict the less urban setting of Wayne Manor in live-action films .   Origin of name   Writer Bill Finger , on the naming of the city and the reason for changing Batman 's locale from New York City to a fictional city , said , `` Originally I was going to call Gotham City 'Civic City . ' Then I tried 'Capital City , ' then 'Coast City . ' Then I flipped through the New York City phone book and spotted the name 'Gotham Jewelers ' and said , 'That 's it , ' Gotham City . We did n't call it New York because we wanted anybody in any city to identify with it . ''   `` Gotham '' had long been a well-known nickname for New York City even prior to Batman 's 1939 introduction , which explains why `` Gotham Jewelers '' and many other businesses in New York City have the word `` Gotham '' in them . The nickname became popular in the nineteenth century ; Washington Irving had first attached it to New York in the November 11 , 1807 edition of his Salmagundi , Burrows , Edwin G. and Mike Wallace . Gotham : A History of New York City to 1898 . ( Oxford University Press , 1999 ) , 417. a periodical which lampooned New York culture and politics . Irving took the name from the village of Gotham , Nottinghamshire , England , a place inhabited , according to folklore , by fools . The village 's name derives from Old English gāt 'goat ' and hām 'home ' , literally `` homestead where goats are kept '' , and is pronounced , like the word goat ( cf . Chatham , , a similar name where the letters th represent a `` t '' sound followed by a silent `` h '' rather than a `` th '' sound ) . The Joker references this etymology in Detective Comics # 880 , in which he tells Batman that the word means `` a safe place for goats '' . In contrast , `` Gotham '' as used for New York has a different pronunciation by analogy to other words spelled with `` th '' and is pronounced as ,  like the word Goth .   Fictional history   In Swamp Thing # 53 , Alan Moore wrote a fictional history for Gotham City that other writers have generally followed . According to Moore 's tale , a Norwegian mercenary , Captain Jon Logerquist , founded Gotham City in 1635 and the British later took it over—a story that parallels the founding of New York by the Dutch ( as New Amsterdam ) and later takeover by the British . During the American Revolutionary War , Gotham City was the site of a major battle ( paralleling the Battle of Brooklyn in the American Revolution ) . This was detailed in Rick Veitch 's Swamp Thing # 85 featuring Tomahawk . Rumors held it to be the site of various occult rites .   The occult origins of Gotham are further delved into by Peter Milligan 's 1990 story arc `` Dark Knight , Dark City '' , which reveals that some of the American Founding Fathers are involved in summoning a bat-demon which becomes trapped beneath old `` Gotham Town '' , its dark influence spreading as Gotham City evolves . A similar trend is followed in 2005 's Shadowpact # 5 by Bill Willingham , which expands upon Gotham"], [289, "Copenhagen ( , ; ( ) ) is the capital and most populated city of Denmark . It has a municipal population of 591,481 and a larger urban population of 1,280,371 ( ) . The Copenhagen metropolitan area has just over 2 million inhabitants . The city is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand ; another small portion of the city is located on Amager , and is separated from Malmö , Sweden , by the strait of Øresund .   Originally a Viking fishing village founded in the 10th century , Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century . Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions , defences and armed forces . After suffering from the effects of plague and fire in the 18th century , the city underwent a period of redevelopment . This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts . After further disasters in the early 19th century when Nelson attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city , rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen 's architecture . Later , following the Second World War , the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre .   Since the turn of the 21st century , Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development , facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure . The city is the cultural , economic and governmental centre of Denmark ; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange . Copenhagen 's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector , especially through initiatives in information technology , pharmaceuticals and clean technology . Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge , Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city , Malmö , forming the Øresund Region . With a number of bridges connecting the various districts , the cityscape is characterized by parks , promenades and waterfronts . Copenhagen 's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens , the Little Mermaid Statue , the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces , Rosenborg Castle Gardens , Frederik 's Church , and many museums , restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions .   Copenhagen is home to the University of Copenhagen , the Technical University of Denmark and Copenhagen Business School . The University of Copenhagen , founded in 1479 , is the oldest university in Denmark . Copenhagen is home to the FC København and Brøndby football clubs . The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980 . Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world . The Copenhagen Metro serves central Copenhagen together with the S-train network connecting the outlying boroughs . Serving roughly 2 million passengers a month , Copenhagen Airport , Kastrup , is the largest airport in the Nordic countries .   Etymology   The name of the city reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce . The original designation , from which the contemporary Danish name derives , was Køpmannæhafn , meaning `` merchants ' harbour '' , often simply Hafn or Havn ( `` harbour '' ) . The literal English translation would be `` Chapman 's haven '' . The English name for the city was adapted from its Low German name , Kopenhagen . The abbreviations Kbh . or Kbhvn are often used in Danish for København , and kbh . for københavnsk ( of Copenhagen ) .   The chemical element hafnium is named for Copenhagen ( Latin name Hafnia ) , where it was discovered . The bacterium Hafnia is also named after Copenhagen : Vagn Møller of the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen named it in 1954 .   History   Early history   Although the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century , recent archaeological finds in connection with work on the city 's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant 's mansion near today 's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020 . Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century . The remains of an ancient church , with graves dating to the 11th century , have been unearthed near where Strøget meets Rådhuspladsen .   These finds indicate that Copenhagen 's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century . Substantial"], [290, "A Tory holds a political philosophy ( Toryism ) based on a British version of traditionalism and conservatism . In politics , the Tory political faction originated with the Cavalier faction during the English Civil War . This political philosophy is prominent in the politics of the United Kingdom , and also appears in parts of the Commonwealth of Nations , particularly in Canada . It also had exponents in parts of the former British Empire , such as the Loyalists of British America who opposed American secession during the American Revolutionary War . The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase `` God , King and Country '' . Tories generally advocate monarchism , are usually of a high church Anglican religious heritage , and are opposed to the liberalism of the Whig faction . Under the Corn Laws ( 1815–1846 ) a majority of Tories supported protectionist agrarianism with tariffs being imposed at the time for sustainability , self-sufficiency and enhanced wages in rural employment .   The Tory political faction originally emerged within the Parliament of England to uphold the legitimist rights of James II , Duke of York , to succeed his brother Charles II to the throne . James was a Catholic while the state institutions had broken from the Catholic Church—this was an issue for the Exclusion Crisis supporting Patricians , the political heirs to the nonconformist Roundheads and Covenanters . There were two Tory ministries under James II ; the first led by Laurence Hyde , 1st Earl of Rochester , the second by Lord Belasyse . A significant faction took part in the ousting of James II with the Whigs to defend the Anglican Church or definitive protestantism . A large but dwindling faction of Tories held sympathy for Catholic Stuart heirs to the throne from the 1714 accession of George I of Great Britain , the first Hanoverian monarch , many of which supported Jacobitism , the military campaigns of which saw them lost and castigated . Although only a minority of Tories gave their adhesion to the Jacobite risings , it was used by the Whigs to completely discredit the Tories and paint them as traitors . After the advent of the Prime Ministerial system under the Whig Robert Walpole , John Stuart , 3rd Earl of Bute 's premiership in the reign of George III marked a revival .   Conservatism emerged by the end of the 18th century—it synthesised moderate Whig economic positions and many Tory social values to create a new political philosophy and faction , in opposition to the French Revolution . Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger led the way in this . Interventionism and a strong military were to prove a hallmark of Toryism under subsequent Prime Ministers . Due to these Tories leading the formation of the Conservative Party , members of the party are colloquially referred to as Tories , even if they are not traditionalists . Actual adherents to traditional Toryism in contemporary times may be referred to as `` High Tories '' as the traditionalist conservative values of Toryism differ from that of the more liberal and cosmopolitan parts of the Conservative Party .   History of the term   The word `` Tory '' derives from the Middle Irish word tóraidhe ; modern Irish tóraí : outlaw , robber or brigand , from the Irish word tóir , meaning `` pursuit '' , since outlaws were `` pursued men '' . It was originally used to refer to a Rapparee and later applied to Confederates or Cavaliers in arms . The term was thus originally a term of abuse , `` an Irish rebel '' , before being adopted as a political label in the same way as `` Whig '' .   Towards the end of Charles II 's reign ( 1660–85 ) there was some debate about whether or not his brother , James , Duke of York , should be allowed to succeed to the throne . `` Whigs '' , originally a reference to Scottish cattle-drivers ( stereotypically radical anti-Catholic Covenanters ) , was the abusive term directed at those who wanted to exclude James on the grounds that he was a Roman Catholic . Those who were not prepared to exclude James were labelled `` Abhorrers '' and later `` Tories '' . Titus Oates applied the term `` Tory '' , which then signified an Irish robber , to those who would not believe in his Popish Plot , and the name gradually became extended to all who were supposed to have sympathy with the Catholic Duke of York .   The suffix -ism was quickly added to both `` Whig '' and ``"], [291, "The Archers is a long-running British radio soap opera broadcast on the BBC 's main spoken-word channel , Radio 4 .

Programme synopsis   The Archers is set in the fictional village of Ambridge in the fictional county of Borsetshire , in the English Midlands . Borsetshire is situated between , in reality , the contiguous counties of Worcestershire and Warwickshire , south of Birmingham in the West Midlands . Various villages claim to be the inspiration for Ambridge : Ambridge 's public house , The Bull , is modelled on The Old Bull in Inkberrow , whereas Hanbury 's St Mary the Virgin is often used as a stand-in for Ambridge 's parish church , St Stephen 's .   Other fictional villages include Penny Hassett , Loxley Barrett , Darrington , Hollerton , Edgeley , Waterley Cross and Lakey Green . The county town of Borsetshire is Borchester , and the nearest big city is the cathedral city of Felpersham . Felpersham also has a university . Anywhere further from Ambridge may be referred to humorously with comments such as 'that 's on the other side of Felpersham !

The show premiered on NBC on October 11 , 1975 , under the original title NBC 's Saturday Night . The show 's comedy sketches , which parody contemporary culture and politics , are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members . Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest ( who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast ) and features performances by a musical guest . An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming , `` Live from New York , it 's Saturday Night ! `` , properly beginning the show .   In 1980 Michaels left the series to explore other opportunities . He was replaced by Jean Doumanian , who was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews . Ebersol ran the show until 1985 , when Michaels returned ; Michaels has remained since then . Many of SNLs cast found national stardom while appearing on the show , and achieved success in film and television , both in front of and behind the camera . Others associated with the show , such as writers , have gone on to successful careers creating , writing , or starring in TV and film .   Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC 's headquarters in the Comcast Building , SNL has aired 808 episodes since its debut , and concluded its forty-first season on May 21 , 2016 , making it one of the longest-running network television programs in the United States . The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries , including Canada , Spain , Italy , South Korea , Japan , Brazil , and Finland , each meeting with different levels of success . Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature films , although only two met with critical and financial success : The Blues Brothers ( 1980 ) and Wayne 's World ( 1992 ) . The show has been marketed in other ways , including home media releases of `` best of '' and whole seasons , and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show .   Throughout four decades on air , Saturday Night Live has received a number of awards , including 42 Primetime Emmy Awards , two Peabody Awards , and three Writers Guild of America Awards . In 2000 , it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame . It was ranked tenth in TV Guide `` 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time '' list , and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine 's `` 100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME '' . As of 2012 , it has received 156 Emmy nominations , the most received by any TV show . The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship , with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests .   Development    From 1965 until September 1975 , NBC ran The Best of Carson reruns of The Tonight Show , airing them on either Saturday or Sunday night at local affiliates ' discretion ( originally known as The Saturday/Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson ) . In 1974 Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired during weeknights , allowing him to take time off .   In 1974 NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming , Dick Ebersol , and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot . At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller , Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels . Over the next three weeks , Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter 's idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches , political satire , and music performances . By 1975 Michaels had assembled a talented cast , including Dan Aykroyd , John Belushi , Chevy Chase , Jane Curtin , Garrett Morris , Laraine Newman , Michael O'Donoghue , Gilda Radner , and George Coe . The show was originally called NBC 's Saturday Night , because Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC . NBC purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new title on March 26 , 1977"], [293, "The Seven Year Itch is a 1955 American romantic comedy film based on a three-act play with the same name by George Axelrod . The film was co-written and directed by Billy Wilder , and stars Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell , reprising his Broadway role from the play . It contains one of the most iconic images of the 20th century – Monroe standing on a subway grate as her white dress is blown upwards by a passing train . The titular phrase , which refers to declining interest in a monogamous relationship after seven years of marriage , has been used by psychologists .   Plot   Richard Sherman ( Tom Ewell ) is a nerdy , faithful , middle-aged publishing executive with an overactive imagination and a mid-life crisis , whose wife , Helen ( Evelyn Keyes ) , and son , Ricky ( Butch Bernard ) , are spending the summer in Maine . When he returns home with the kayak paddle Ricky accidentally left behind , he meets a woman ( Marilyn Monroe ) , who is a commercial actress and former model who rents the apartment upstairs while in town to make television spots for a brand of toothpaste . That evening , he works on reading the manuscript of a book in which psychiatrist Dr. Brubaker ( Oskar Homolka ) claims that almost all men are driven to have extra-marital affairs in the seventh year of marriage . Sherman has an imaginary conversation with Helen , trying to convince her , in three fantasy sequences , that he is irresistible to women , including his secretary , a nurse , and Helen 's bridesmaid , but she laughs it off . A tomato plant then crashes into his lounge chair ; the woman upstairs apologizes for accidentally knocking it off the balcony , and Richard invites her down for a drink .   He waits for her to get dressed , including in underwear she says she keeps cool in her icebox . When she arrives , a vision in pink , they have a drink and he lies about being married . When she sees his wedding ring , he backtracks but she is unconcerned , having no designs on him , only on his air-conditioning . He has a fantasy that she is a femme fatale overcome by his playing of Rachmaninoff 's Second Piano Concerto . In reality , she prefers Chopsticks , which they play together . Richard , overcome by his fantasies , awkwardly grabs at her , causing them to fall off the piano bench . He apologizes for his indiscretion but she says it happens to her all the time . Guilt-ridden , however , he asks her to leave .   Over the next few days , they spend more time together and Richard imagines that they are growing closer , although she is immune to his imagined charms . Helen continually calls her husband , asking him to send the paddle so Ricky can use the kayak , but Richard is repeatedly distracted . His waning resolve to resist temptation fuels his fear that he is succumbing to the `` Seven Year Itch '' . He seeks help from Dr. Brubaker , but to no avail . His imagination then runs even wilder : the young woman tells a plumber ( Victor Moore ) how Richard is `` just like The Creature from the Black Lagoon '' ; the plumber repeats her story to neighbor McKenzie , whom Helen had asked to drop by to pick up Ricky 's paddle .

They come in many forms consisting of liquids , powders , gels , and pastes . Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in domestic cooking . Due to its safety and general availability , food coloring is also used in a variety of non-food applications including cosmetics , pharmaceuticals , home craft projects , and medical devices .   Purpose of food coloring   People associate certain colors with certain flavors , and the color of food can influence the perceived flavor in anything from candy to wine . Sometimes the aim is to simulate a color that is perceived by the consumer as natural , such as adding red coloring to glacé cherries ( which would otherwise be beige ) , but sometimes it is for effect , like the green ketchup that Heinz launched in 1999 . Color additives are used in foods for many reasons including :   * Offset color loss due to exposure to light , air , temperature extremes , moisture and storage conditions  * Correct natural variations in color  * Enhance colors that occur naturally  * Provide color to colorless and `` fun '' foods  * Make food more attractive and appetizing , and informative  * Allow consumers to identify products on sight , like candy flavors or medicine dosages   File : Indigo carmine.svg | Indigo carmine , which is blue .

Regulation   Past use and regulation history   The addition of colorants to foods is thought to have occurred in Egyptian cities as early as 1500 BC , when candy makers added natural extracts and wine to improve the products ' appearance . During the Middle Ages , the economy in the European countries was based on agriculture , and the peasants were accustomed to producing their own food locally or trading within the village communities . Under feudalism , aesthetic aspects were not considered , at least not by the vast majority of the generally very poor population . This situation changed with urbanization at the beginning of the Modern Age , when trade emerged—especially the import of precious spices and colors . One of the very first food laws , created in Augsburg , Germany , in 1531 , concerned spices or colorants and required saffron counterfeiters to be burned .   With the onset of the industrial revolution , people became dependent on foods produced by others . These new urban dwellers demanded food at low cost . Analytical chemistry was still primitive and regulations few . The adulteration of foods flourished . Heavy metal and other inorganic element-containing compounds turned out to be cheap and suitable to `` restore '' the color of watered-down milk and other foodstuffs , some more lurid examples being :  * Red lead ( Pb3O4 ) and vermillion ( HgS ) were routinely used to color cheese and confectionery .  * Copper arsenite ( CuHAsO3 ) was used to recolor used tea leaves for resale . It also caused two deaths when used to color a dessert in 1860 .   Sellers at the time offered more than 80 artificial coloring agents , some invented for dyeing textiles , not foods . Many color additives had never been tested for toxicity or other adverse effects . Historical records show that injuries , even deaths , resulted from tainted colorants . In 1851 , about 200 people were poisoned in England , 17 of them fatally , directly as a result of eating adulterated lozenges . In 1856 , mauveine , the first synthetic color , was developed by Sir William Henry Perkin and by the turn of the century , unmonitored color additives had spread through Europe and the United States in all sorts of popular foods , including ketchup , mustard , jellies , and wine .   Concerns over food safety led to numerous regulations throughout the world , . German food regulations released in 1882 stipulated the exclusion of dangerous minerals such as arsenic , copper , chromium , lead , mercury and zinc , which were frequently used as ingredients in colorants"], [296, "Elvis Aaron Presley ( January 8 , 1935 – August 16 , 1977 ) was an American musician and actor . Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century , he is often referred to as `` the King of Rock and Roll '' , or simply , `` the King '' .   Presley was born in Tupelo , Mississippi , as a twinless twin , and when he was 13 years old , he and his family relocated to Memphis , Tennessee . His music career began there in 1954 , when he recorded a song with producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records . Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black , Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly , an uptempo , backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues . RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker , who managed the singer for more than two decades . Presley 's first RCA single , `` Heartbreak Hotel '' , was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States . He was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records . His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style , combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement , made him enormously popular—and controversial .   In November 1956 , he made his film debut in Love Me Tender . In 1958 , he was drafted into military service . He resumed his recording career two years later , producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying soundtrack albums , most of which were critically derided . In 1968 , following a seven-year break from live performances , he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis , which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours . In 1973 , Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite , Aloha from Hawaii . Several years of prescription drug abuse severely damaged his health , and he died in 1977 at the age of 42 .   Presley is one of the most celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century . Commercially successful in many genres , including pop , blues and gospel , he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music , with estimated record sales of around 600 million units worldwide . He won three Grammys , also receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36 , and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame .   Life and career   1935–53 : Early years   Childhood in Tupelo   Presley was born on January 8 , 1935 , in Tupelo , Mississippi , the son of Gladys Love ( née Smith ; April 25 , 1912 – August 14 , 1958 ) and Vernon Elvis Presley ( April 10 , 1916 – June 26 , 1979 ) , in the two-room shotgun house built by Vernon 's father in preparation for the child 's birth . Jesse Garon Presley , his identical twin brother , was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before him . As an only child , Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother . The family attended an Assembly of God , where he found his initial musical inspiration . Although he was in conflict with the Pentecostal church in his later years , he never officially left it . Rev . Rex Humbard officiated at his funeral , as Presley had been an admirer of Humbard 's ministry .   Presley 's ancestry was primarily a Western European mix , including Scots-Irish , Scottish , German , and some French Norman . Gladys 's great-great-grandmother , Morning Dove White , was possibly a Cherokee Native American . Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family . Vernon moved from one odd job to the next , evincing little ambition . The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance . The Presleys survived the F5 tornado in the 1936 Tupelo–Gainesville tornado outbreak . In 1938 , they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of kiting a check written by the landowner , Orville S. Bean , the dairy farmer and cattle-and-hog broker for whom he then worked .

It was a Project 949A Антей ( Antey , Antaeus ; NATO reporting name `` Oscar II '' ) submarine .   It was named after the Russian city of Kursk , around which the largest tank battle in history , the Battle of Kursk , took place in 1943 . One of the first vessels completed after the end of the Soviet Union , it was commissioned into the Russian Navy 's Northern Fleet .   Construction   Work on building Kursk began in 1990 at Severodvinsk , near Arkhangelsk . Launched in 1994 , it was commissioned in December of that year . It was the penultimate Oscar II class submarine designed and approved in the Soviet era .   Capabilities   The Antey design represented the highest achievement of Soviet nuclear submarine technology . They were the largest attack submarines ever built . It was built to defeat an entire United States aircraft carrier group . A single Type 65 torpedo carried a 450 kg warhead powerful enough to sink an aircraft carrier . Both missiles and torpedoes could be equipped with nuclear warheads . She was 30 ft longer than any other Oscar I-class submarine . The senior officers had individual staterooms and the entire crew had access to a gymnasium .   The outer hull , made of high-nickel , high-chrome content stainless steel thick , had exceptionally good resistance to corrosion and a weak magnetic signature which helped prevent detection by U.S. magnetic anomaly detector ( MAD ) systems . There was a 200 cm gap to the -thick steel pressure hull . She was designed to remain submerged for up to 120 days . The sail superstructure was reinforced to allow it to break through the Arctic ice .  The submarine was armed with 24 SS-N-19/P-700 Granit cruise missiles , and eight torpedo tubes in the bow : four 533 mm and four 650 mm . The Granit missiles with a range of 550 km , were capable of supersonic flight at altitudes over 20 km . They were designed to swarm enemy vessels and intelligently choose individual targets which terminated with a dive onto the target . The torpedo tubes could be used to launch either torpedoes or anti-ship missiles with a range of 50 km . Her weapons included 18 SS-N-16 `` Stallion '' anti-ship missiles designed to defeat the best Western naval air defenses .   Kursk was part of Russia 's Northern Fleet , which had suffered funding cutbacks throughout the 1990s . Many of its submarines were anchored and rusting in Zapadnaya Litsa Naval Base , 100 km from Murmansk . Little work to maintain all but the most essential front-line equipment , including search and rescue equipment , had occurred . Northern Fleet sailors had gone unpaid in the mid-1990s .   Deployments   During her five years of service , Kursk completed only one mission , a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean during the summer of 1999 to monitor the United States Sixth Fleet responding to the Kosovo crisis . This was due to a lack of funds for fuel . As a result , many of her crew had spent little time at sea and were inexperienced .   Naval exercise and disaster   Kursk joined the `` Summer-X '' exercise , the first large-scale naval exercise planned by the Russian Navy in more than a decade , on 10 August 2000 . It included 30 ships including the fleet 's flagship Pyotr Velikiy ( `` Peter the Great '' ) , four attack submarines , and a flotilla of smaller ships . The crew had recently won a citation for its excellent performance and been recognized as the best submarine crew in the Northern Fleet . While it was an exercise , Kursk loaded a full complement of combat weapons . It was one of the few ships authorized to carry a combat load at all times .   Explosion   On the first day of the exercise , Kursk successfully launched a Granit missile armed with a dummy warhead . Two days later , on the morning of 12 August , she prepared to fire dummy torpedoes at the Kirov-class battlecruiser"], [299, "BBC Four is a British television channel operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) and available to digital television viewers on Freeview , IPTV , satellite , and cable .   BBC Four launched on 2 March 2002 , with a schedule running from 19:00 to 04:00 . The channel shows `` a wide variety of programmes including comedy , documentaries , music , international film , original programmes , drama and current affairs ... an alternative to programmes on the mainstream TV channels '' . It is required by its licence to broadcast at least 100 hours of new arts and music programmes , 110 hours of new factual programmes and to premiere twenty international films each year .   History   BBC Four launched on 2 March 2002 at 19.00 GMT , having been delayed from the original planned 2001 launch . BBC 4 began originally as a late schedule to BBC 2 , before it received its own channel , along with BBC 3 . Weirdly , BBC 4 had to launch before BBC Three as a result of the government delaying approval plans . The channel replaced BBC Knowledge , an educational and cultural channel which had undergone many changes throughout its lifetime ; in its final format it carried a schedule of documentaries and art programming , essentially a test of the new BBC Four schedule . BBC Four would rebrand this channel , and bring it into line with the well recognised BBC One and Two brands at the same time . Planning for the new channel , along with the new BBC Three , had been in progress since October 2000 ; however , the incumbent government delayed approving the new BBC digital plans . The BBC Four plans were approved earlier , and as a result launched before BBC Three .   BBC Four was different from the old BBC Knowledge : the channel would be more heavily promoted with more new and original programming and the channel would not be broadcast 24 hours a day . This was because on the Freeview digital terrestrial platform , BBC Four is broadcast in a statistically multiplexed stream in Multiplex B that timeshares with the CBeebies channel ( which is on air from 6.00 until 19.00 ) . As a result , BBC Four broadcasts from 19.00 to around 4.00 each night , with an hour 's down-time and promotions for CBeebies before the start of that channel 's schedule .   On 12 May 2011 , BBC Four was added to the Sky EPG in Ireland on channel 230 .   Organisation   BBC Four forms part of the BBC Vision group , and as a result , the channel controller is answerable to the head of this executive department : Emma Swain , as of 2012 . The channel direction is determined by the channel 's remit , set by royal charter and the corporation 's governing body ( the BBC Trust ) , and by the channel controller . In October 2013 , following the departure of Richard Klein from the controllership , the management of the channel changed , with the role of Controller of BBC Four scrapped : from this point the Controller of BBC Two would have ultimate oversight of BBC Four as part of their role , absorbing some of the former duties of the Controller of BBC Four , but a new 'Channel Editor ' post , reporting up to this controller , would be created to take day-to-day charge of Four . The controllers of BBC Four from 2002-2016 had been :   * 2002–2004 : Roly Keating  * 2004–2008 : Janice Hadlow  * 2008–2013 : Richard Klein  * 2013–2014 : Janice Hadlow ( as Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four ) `` on an interim basis '' - Hadlow had been Controller of BBC Two since departing BBC Four in 2008  * Early 2014 : Adam Barker ( interim Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four following Janice Hadlow 's departure to a new post )  * 2014–2016 : Kim Shillinglaw ( as Controller of BBC Two and BBC Four )   Channel Editors of BBC Four have been :   * 2013–present : Cassian Harrison   BBC Four has an annual budget of £54.3 million .   On 20 January 2016 , Kim Shillinglaw announced that she has decided to leave the BBC as the Controller of BBC Two & BBC Four . As a result of the reorganisation , the post of Controller BBC Two and Four will close after her departure later in 2016 .

Fewer than two percent of South Africans speak a first language other than an official one . Most South Africans can speak more than one language . Dutch and English were the first official languages of South Africa from 1910 to 1925 . Afrikaans was added as a part of Dutch in 1925 , although in practice , Afrikaans effectively replaced Dutch , which fell into disuse . When South Africa became a republic in 1961 the official relationship changed such that Afrikaans was considered to include Dutch , and Dutch was dropped in 1984 , so between 1984 and 1994 , South Africa had two official languages : English and Afrikaans .   Different government departments and official bodies use different terms to denote Northern Sotho . In South Africa , Southern Ndebele is known simply as Ndebele , as most speakers of Northern Ndebele live in Zimbabwe .   Since taking power in the 1994 election , the ANC has promoted English as the main language of government , even if South Africans often take pride in using indigenous languages for any purpose . Afrikaans also features prominently in commerce together with English , as the languages with the highest number of fluent speakers are Afrikaans and English .   In terms of linguistic classification , the official languages include two West Germanic languages ( English and Afrikaans ) and nine Bantu languages . Four of these are Nguni languages ( Zulu , Xhosa , Swati and Ndebele ) and three are Sotho–Tswana languages ( Northern Sotho , Southern Sotho and Tswana ) . Tsonga is a Tswa–Ronga language .   South African Sign Language is understood across the country , though sometimes sign-language interpreters use manually coded language .   Language demographics   The most common language spoken as a first language by South Africans is Zulu ( 23 percent ) , followed by Xhosa ( 16 percent ) , and Afrikaans ( 14 percent ) . English is the fourth most common first language in the country ( 9.6 % ) , but is understood in most urban areas and is the dominant language in government and the media .   The majority of South Africans speak a language from one of the two principal branches of the Bantu languages represented in South Africa : the Sotho–Tswana branch ( Sesotho , Northern Sotho , Tswana ) , or the Nguni branch ( Zulu , Xhosa , Swazi , Ndebele ) . For each of the two groups , the languages within that group are for the most part intelligible to a native speaker of any other language within that group .   The nine indigenous African languages of South Africa can be divided into two geographical zones , with Nguni languages being predominant in the south-eastern third of the country ( Indian Ocean coast ) and Sesotho languages being predominant in the northern third of the country located further inland , as also in Botswana and Lesotho . Gauteng is the most linguistically heterogeneous province , with roughly equal numbers of Nguni , Sesotho and Indo-European language speakers . This has resulted in the spread of an urban argot , Tsotsitaal , in large urban townships in the province .   Afrikaans , a language derived from Dutch , is the most widely spoken language in the western half of the country ( Western and Northern Cape ) . It is spoken as first language by approximately 61 percent of whites and 76 percent of Coloured ( multiracial ) people in the country . Afrikaans is also spoken widely across the centre and north of the country , as a second ( or third or even fourth ) language by Black South Africans living in farming areas .   The 2011 census recorded the following distribution of first language speakers :   Other significant languages spoken in South Africa   Other languages spoken in South Africa , though not mentioned in the Constitution , include Fanagalo , Lobedu ( Khilobedu ) , Northern Ndebele ( Sindebele ) , Phuthi ( Siphuthi ) .  Lobedu has been variously claimed to be a dialect of Northern Sotho and an autonomous language . Fanagalo is a pidgin often used as a mining lingua franca .   Significant numbers of immigrants from Europe , elsewhere in Africa , and the Indian subcontinent means that a wide variety of other languages can also be found in parts of South Africa .

According to the Hebrew Bible , he was a former Egyptian prince who later in life became a religious leader and lawgiver , to whom the authorship of the Torah is traditionally attributed . Also called Moshe Rabbenu in Hebrew ( , lit . `` Moses our Teacher '' ) , he is the most important prophet in Judaism . He is also an important prophet in Christianity , Islam , Baha'ism as well as a number of other faiths .   According to the Book of Exodus , Moses was born in a time when his people , the Israelites , an enslaved minority , were increasing in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt 's enemies . Moses ' Hebrew mother , Jochebed , secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites . Through the Pharaoh 's daughter ( identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash ) , the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile river and grew up with the Egyptian royal family . After killing an Egyptian slavemaster ( because the slavemaster was smiting a Hebrew to death ) , Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian , where he encountered The Angel of the Lord , speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb ( which he regarded as the Mountain of God ) .   God sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery . Moses said that he could not speak with assurance or eloquence , so God allowed Aaron , his brother , to become his spokesperson . After the Ten Plagues , Moses led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea , after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai , where Moses received the Ten Commandments . After 40 years of wandering in the desert , Moses died within sight of the Promised Land .   According to archaeologist William G. Dever , scholarly consensus sees Moses as a legendary figure and not a historical person . Archaeological evidence does not support a mass-migration from Egypt , as described in the Bible . Rabbinical Judaism calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391–1271 ( 120 years ) BCE ; Jerome gives 1592 BCE , and James Ussher 1571 BCE as his birth year .   Name   The Biblical account of Moses ' birth provides him with a folk etymology to explain the ostensible meaning of his name . He is said to have received it from the Pharaoh 's daughter : `` he became her son . She named him Moses ( Moshe ) , saying , `` I drew him out ( meshitihu ) of the water .

This explanation links it to a verb mashah , meaning `` to draw out '' , which makes the Pharaoh 's daughter 's declaration a play on words . The princess made a grammatical mistake which is prophetic of his role in his future life , as someone who will `` draw the people of Israel out of Egypt through the waters of the Red Sea . ''   Several etymologies have been proposed .

It ran from 1975 to 1978 and was written by Bob Larbey and John Esmonde . Opening with the midlife crisis faced by Tom Good , a 40-year-old London plastics designer , it relates the joys and miseries he and his wife Barbara experience when they attempt to escape modern commercial living by `` becoming totally self-sufficient '' in their home in Surbiton . In 2004 , it came 9th in Britain 's Best Sitcom . In the United States , it aired on various PBS stations under the title Good Neighbors .   Background   The Good Life was written by John Esmonde and Bob Larbey for Richard Briers , the only cast member with a previously established high-profile . Larbey and Esmonde were inspired by Larbey attaining his 40th birthday , which seemed to them a milestone in most people 's lives . Their storyline has the Goods ' decision to pursue self-sufficiency conflicting sharply with the habits of the Leadbetters , who live next door . The conflict between neighbours balanced with an increasingly close friendship creates comic tension as that friendship is tried to its limits .   Peter Bowles was originally cast to play the role of Jerry , but was unavailable . He later starred opposite Penelope Keith in To the Manor Born . Hannah Gordon was considered for the role of Barbara but ruled out , having recently played a similar role in the BBC sitcom My Wife Next Door . Esmonde and Larbey chose Felicity Kendal and Penelope Keith after seeing them on stage together in The Norman Conquests . The location filming was in the North London suburb of Northwood , although the series was set in Surbiton , southwest London .

Their house is paid for so he and his wife Barbara adopt a sustainable , simple and self-sufficient lifestyle while staying in their home in The Avenue , Surbiton . They turn their front and back gardens into allotments , growing soft fruit and vegetables . They introduce chickens , pigs ( Pinky and Perky ) , a goat ( Geraldine ) and a cockerel ( Lenin ) . They generate their own electricity , using methane from animal waste , and attempt to make their own clothes . They sell or barter surplus crops for essentials they can not make themselves . They cut their monetary requirements to the minimum with varying success .   Their actions horrify their kindly but conventional neighbours , Margo and Jerry Leadbetter . Margo and Jerry were intended to be minor characters , but their relationship with one another and the Goods became an essential element .

These can be yachts , military vessels , cruise liners or other cargo or passenger ships . Dockyards are sometimes more associated with maintenance and basing activities than shipyards , which are sometimes associated more with initial construction . The terms are routinely used interchangeably , in part because the evolution of dockyards and shipyards has often caused them to change or merge roles .   Countries with large shipbuilding industries include Singapore , South Korea , Australia , Japan , China , Germany , Romania , Turkey , Poland and Croatia . The shipbuilding industry tends to be more fragmented in Europe than in Asia . In European countries there are a greater number of small companies , compared to the fewer , larger companies in the shipbuilding countries of Asia .   Most shipbuilders in the United States are privately owned , the largest being Huntington Ingalls Industries , a multibillion-dollar defense contractor , and the oldest family owned shipyard being [ http : //www.colonnashipyard.com Colonna 's Shipyard ] in Norfolk , VA . The publicly owned shipyards in the US are Naval facilities providing basing , support and repair .   Shipyards are constructed nearby the sea or tidal rivers to allow easy access for their ships . In the United Kingdom , for example , shipyards were established on the River Thames ( King Henry VIII founded yards at Woolwich and Deptford in 1512 and 1513 respectively ) , River Mersey , River Tees , River Tyne , River Wear and River Clyde – the latter growing to be the World 's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre .   Sir Alfred Yarrow established his yard by the Thames in London 's Docklands in the late 19th century before moving it northwards to the banks of the Clyde at Scotstoun ( 1906–08 ) . Other famous UK shipyards include the Harland and Wolff yard in Belfast , Northern Ireland , where Titanic was built , and the naval dockyard at Chatham , England on the Medway in north Kent .   The site of a large shipyard will contain many specialised cranes , dry docks , slipways , dust-free warehouses , painting facilities and extremely large areas for fabrication of the ships .   After a ship 's useful life is over , it makes its final voyage to a shipbreaking yard , often on a beach in South Asia . Historically shipbreaking was carried on in drydock in developed countries , but high wages and environmental regulations have resulted in movement of the industry to developing regions .   History   The world 's earliest known dockyards were built in the Harappan port city of Lothal circa 2600 BC in Gujarat , India . Lothal 's dockyards connected to an ancient course of the Sabarmati river on the trade route between Harappan cities in Sindh and the peninsula of Saurashtra when the surrounding Kutch desert was a part of the Arabian Sea .   Lothal engineers accorded high priority to the creation of a dockyard and a warehouse to serve the purposes of naval trade . The dock was built on the eastern flank of the town , and is regarded by archaeologists as an engineering feat of the highest order . It was located away from the main current of the river to avoid silting , but provided access to ships in high tide as well .   The name of the ancient Greek city of Naupactus means `` shipyard '' ( combination of the Greek words ναύς naus ship , boat and πήγνυμι pêgnumi , pegnymi builder , fixer ) . Naupactus ' reputation in this field extends to the time of legend , where it is depicted as the place where the Heraclidae built a fleet to invade the Peloponnesus .   In the Spanish city of Barcelona , the Drassanes shipyards were active from at least the mid-13th century until the 18th century , although it at times served as a barracks for troops as well as an arsenal . During its time of operation it was continuously changed , rebuilt and modified , but two original towers and part of the original eight construction naves remain today . It is currently a maritime museum .   Ships were the first items to be manufactured in a factory , several hundred years before the Industrial Revolution , in the Venice Arsenal , Venice , Italy . The Arsenal apparently mass-produced nearly one ship every day using pre-manufactured parts , and assembly lines and , at its height , employed 16,000 people .

The only surviving examples of monotremes are all indigenous to Australia and New Guinea , although there is evidence that they were once more widespread . The existing monotreme species are the platypus and four species of echidnas . There is currently some debate regarding monotreme taxonomy .   The word monotreme comes from the Greek μονός , monos ( `` single '' ) and τρῆμα , trema ( `` hole '' ) , referring to the cloaca .   General characteristics   Like other mammals , monotremes are warm-blooded with a high metabolic rate ( though not as high as other mammals ; see below ) ; have hair on their bodies ; produce milk through mammary glands to feed their young ; have a single bone in their lower jaw ; and have three middle-ear bones .   In common with reptiles and marsupials , monotremes lack the connective structure ( corpus callosum ) which in placental mammals is the primary communication route between the right and left brain hemispheres . The anterior commissure does provide an alternate communication route between the two hemispheres , though , and in monotremes and marsupials it carries all the commissural fibers arising from the neocortex , whereas in placental mammals the anterior commissure carries only some of these fibers .   Extant monotremes lack teeth as adults . Fossil forms and modern platypus young have a `` tribosphenic '' form of molars ( with the occlusal surface formed by three cusps arranged in a triangle ) , which is one of the hallmarks of extant mammals . Some recent work suggests that monotremes acquired this form of molar independently of placental mammals and marsupials , although this is not well established . Monotreme jaws are constructed somewhat differently from those of other mammals , and the jaw opening muscle is different . As in all true mammals , the tiny bones that conduct sound to the inner ear are fully incorporated into the skull , rather than lying in the jaw as in cynodonts and other premammalian synapsids ; this feature , too , is now claimed to have evolved independently in monotremes and therians , although , as with the analogous evolution of the tribosphenic molar , this is disputed . Nonetheless , findings on the extinct species Teinolophos confirm that suspended ear bones evolved independently among monotremes and therians . The external opening of the ear still lies at the base of the jaw .   The sequencing of the platypus genome has also provided insight into the evolution of a number of monotreme traits , such as venom and electroreception , as well as showing some new unique features , such as the fact that monotremes possess 10 sex chromosomes and that their X chromosome resembles the sex chromosome of birds , suggesting that the two sex chromosomes of marsupial and placental mammals evolved more recently than the split from the monotreme lineage . This feature , along with some other genetic similarities with birds , such as shared genes related to egg-laying , is thought to provide some insight into the most recent common ancestor of the synapsid lineage leading to mammals and the sauropsid lineage leading to birds and modern reptiles , which are believed to have split about 315 million years ago during the Carboniferous . The presence of vitellogenin genes ( a protein necessary for egg shell formation ) is shared with birds , suggesting that when the common ancestor of mammals from ~225 million years ago split into monotremes , marsupials , and placental mammals , egg laying was retained in monotremes and lost in all other mammals . DNA suggests that while this trait is shared and is synapomorphic with birds , platypuses are still mammals and they evolved lactation with other mammals . L-ascorbic acid is synthesized only in the kidneys .   The monotremes also have extra bones in the shoulder girdle , including an interclavicle and coracoid , which are not found in other mammals . Monotremes retain a reptile-like gait , with legs on the sides of , rather than underneath , their bodies . The monotreme leg bears a spur in the ankle region ; the spur is not functional in echidnas , but contains a powerful venom in the male platypus . This venom is derived from b-defensins , proteins that are present in mammals that create holes in viral and bacterial pathogens . Some reptile venom is also composed of different types of b-defensins , another trait shared with reptiles"], [306, "Lebanon ( or ; or ; Lebanese Arabic : ; ) , officially the Lebanese RepublicRepublic of Lebanon is the most common phrase used by Lebanese government agencies . The phrase Lebanese Republic is a literal translation of the official Arabic and French names that is not used in today 's world . Lebanese Arabic is the most common language spoken among the citizens of Lebanon . ( ; Lebanese Arabic : ) , is a sovereign state in Western Asia . It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the southwest . Lebanon 's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity .   The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back more than seven thousand years , predating recorded history . Lebanon was the home of the Canaanites/Phoenicians and their kingdom , a maritime culture that flourished for over a thousand years ( c. 1550–539 BC ) . In 64 BC , the region came under the rule of the Roman Empire , and eventually became one of the Empire 's leading centers of Christianity . In the Mount Lebanon range a monastic tradition known as the Maronite Church was established . As the Arab Muslims conquered the region , the Maronites held onto their religion and identity . However , a new religious group , the Druze , established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well , generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries . During the Crusades , the Maronites re-established contact with the Roman Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome . The ties they established with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era .   The region eventually was ruled by the Ottoman Empire from 1516 to 1918 . Following the collapse of the empire after World War I , the five provinces that constitute modern Lebanon came under the French Mandate of Lebanon . The French expanded the borders of the Mount Lebanon Governorate , which was mostly populated by Maronites and Druze , to include more Muslims . Lebanon gained independence in 1943 , establishing a unique political system - confessionalism - a Consociationalism type of power-sharing mechanism based on religious communities . Bechara El Khoury , first Lebanese president , Riad El-Solh , first Lebanese prime minister and Emir Majid Arslan II , first Lebanese minister of defence , are considered the founders of the modern Republic of Lebanon and are national heroes for having led the country 's independence . Foreign troops withdrew completely from Lebanon on 31 December 1946 . Lebanon has been a member of the Organisation internationale de la francophonie since 1973 .   Before the Lebanese Civil War ( 1975–1990 ) , the country experienced a period of relative calm and renowned prosperity , driven by tourism , agriculture , commerce , and banking . Because of its financial power and diversity in its heyday , Lebanon was referred to as the `` Switzerland of the East '' during the 1960s , and its capital , Beirut , attracted so many tourists that it was known as `` the Paris of the Middle East '' . At the end of the war , there were extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure . In spite of these troubles , Lebanon has the highest Human Development Index in the Arab world , to the exclusion of the oil-rich economies of the Persian Gulf .   Etymology   The name `` Lebanon '' originates from the Semitic root lbn ( ) , meaning `` white , '' which is likely a reference to the snow-capped peaks of Mount Lebanon .   Occurrences of the name have been found in different texts from the library of Ebla , which date to the third millennium BC , nearly 70 times in the Hebrew Bible , and three of the twelve tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh ( perhaps as early as 2100 BC ) .   The name is recorded in Ancient Egyptian as Rmnn , where R stood for Canaanite L .   History   Throughout the centuries leading up to recent times , the country became part of numerous succeeding empires , among them Egyptian Empire , Assyrian Empire , Achaemenid Persian , Hellenistic , Roman , Armenian , Sasanid Persian , Eastern Roman , Arab ( Umayyad , Abbasid , Fatimid ) , Seljuk , Mamluk , the Crusader 's state of County of Tripoli founded by Raymond IV of Toulouse that encompassed most of present-day Lebanon , and the Ottoman Empire . Uniquely , many"], [307, "Reptiles are a group ( Reptilia ) of tetrapod animals comprising today 's turtles , crocodilians , snakes , amphisbaenians , lizards , tuatara , and their extinct relatives . The study of these traditional reptile groups , historically combined with that of modern amphibians , is called herpetology .   The earliest known proto-reptiles originated around 312 million years ago during the Carboniferous period , having evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods that became increasingly adapted to life on dry land . Some early examples include the lizard-like Hylonomus and Casineria . In addition to the living reptiles , there are many diverse groups that are now extinct , in some cases due to mass extinction events . In particular , the K–Pg extinction wiped out the pterosaurs , plesiosaurs , ornithischians , and sauropods , as well as many species of theropods ( e.g . tyrannosaurids and dromaeosaurids ) , crocodyliforms , and squamates ( e.g . mosasaurids ) .   Modern non-avian reptiles inhabit every continent with the exception of Antarctica ( If birds are classed as reptiles , then all continents are inhabited . ) Several living subgroups are recognized : Testudines ( turtles , terrapins and tortoises ) , approximately 400 species ; Sphenodontia ( tuatara from New Zealand ) , 1 species ; Squamata ( lizards , snakes , and worm lizards ) , over 9,600 species ; Crocodilia ( crocodiles , gavials , caimans , and alligators ) , 25 species ; and Aves ( birds ) , 10,000 species . Because some reptiles are more closely related to birds than they are to other reptiles ( crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards ) , many modern scientists prefer to make Reptilia a monophyletic grouping and so also include the birds , which today contain over 10,000 species .   Reptiles are tetrapod vertebrates , creatures that either have four limbs or , like snakes , are descended from four-limbed ancestors . Unlike amphibians , reptiles do not have an aquatic larval stage . Most reptiles are oviparous , although several species of squamates are viviparous , as were some extinct aquatic clades — the fetus develops within the mother , contained in a placenta rather than an eggshell . As amniotes , reptile eggs are surrounded by membranes for protection and transport , which adapt them to reproduction on dry land . Many of the viviparous species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta analogous to those of mammals , with some providing initial care for their hatchlings . Extant reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko , Sphaerodactylus ariasae , which can grow up to 17 mm to the saltwater crocodile , Crocodylus porosus , which may reach 6 m in length and weigh over 1000 kg .   Classification   Research history   In the 18th century , the reptiles were , from the outset of classification , grouped with the amphibians . Linnaeus , working from species-poor Sweden , where the common adder and grass snake are often found hunting in water , included all reptiles and amphibians in class `` III – Amphibia '' in his Systema Naturæ .  The terms `` reptile '' and `` amphibian '' were largely interchangeable , `` reptile '' ( from Latin repere , `` to creep '' ) being preferred by the French . Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti was the first to formally use the term `` Reptilia '' for an expanded selection of reptiles and amphibians basically similar to that of Linnaeus . Today , the two groups are still commonly treated under the same heading as herptiles .   It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that it became clear that reptiles and amphibians are , in fact , quite different animals , and Pierre André Latreille erected the class Batracia ( 1825 ) for the latter , dividing the tetrapods into the four familiar classes of reptiles , amphibians , birds , and mammals . The British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley made Latreille 's definition popular and , together with Richard Owen , expanded Reptilia to include the various fossil `` antediluvian monsters '' , including dinosaurs and the mammal-like ( synapsid ) Dicynodon he helped describe . This was not the only possible classification scheme : In the Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1863 , Huxley grouped the vertebrates into mammals , sauroids , and ichthyoids ( the latter containing the fishes and amphibians ) . He subsequently proposed the names of Sauropsida and Ichthyopsida for the latter two groups . In 1866 , Haeckel demonstrated that vertebrates could be divided based on their reproductive"], [308, "Ireland ( ; ) , also known as the Republic of Ireland ( ' ) , is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland . The capital and largest city is Dublin , which is located on the eastern part of the island , and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country 's 4.75 million inhabitants . The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland , a part of the United Kingdom . It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the Celtic Sea to the south , Saint George 's Channel to the south-east and the Irish Sea to the east . It is a unitary , parliamentary republic . The legislature , the ' , consists of a lower house , ' , an upper house , ' , and an elected President ( ' ) who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state , but with some important powers and duties . The head of government is the ' ( Prime Minister , literally 'Chief ' , a title not used in English ) , who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President , and appoints other government ministers .   The state was created as the Irish Free State in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty . It had the status of dominion until 1937 when a new constitution was adopted , in which the state was named `` Ireland '' and effectively became a republic , with an elected non-executive president as head of state . It was officially declared a republic in 1949 , following the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 . Ireland became a member of the United Nations in December 1955 . It joined the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , the predecessor of the European Union , in 1973 . The state had no formal relations with Northern Ireland for most of the twentieth century , but during the 1980s and 1990s the British and Irish governments worked with the Northern Ireland parties towards a resolution to `` the Troubles '' . Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 , the Irish government and Northern Ireland Executive have co-operated on a number of policy areas under the North-South Ministerial Council created by the Agreement .   Ireland ranks among the top twenty-five wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita , and as the tenth most prosperous country in the world according to The Legatum Prosperity Index 2015 . After joining the EEC , Ireland enacted a series of liberal economic policies that resulted in rapid economic growth . The country achieved considerable prosperity between the years of 1995 and 2007 , which became known as the Celtic Tiger period . This was halted by an unprecedented financial crisis that began in 2008 , in conjunction with the concurrent global economic crash . However , as the Irish economy was the fastest growing in the EU in 2015 Ireland is again quickly ascending league tables comparing wealth and prosperity internationally . For example , in 2015 , Ireland was ranked as the joint sixth ( with Germany ) most developed country in the world by the United Nations Human Development Index . It also performs well in several national performance metrics , including freedom of the press , economic freedom and civil liberties . Ireland is a member of the European Union and is a founding member of the Council of Europe and the OECD . The Irish government has followed a policy of military neutrality through non-alignment since immediately prior to World War II and the country is consequently not a member of NATO , although it is a member in Partnership for Peace .   Name   The 1922 state , comprising 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland , was `` styled and known as the Irish Free State '' . The Constitution of Ireland , adopted in 1937 , provides that `` the name of the State is Éire , or , in the English language , Ireland '' . Section 2 of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 states , `` It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland . '' The 1948 Act does not name the state as `` Republic of Ireland '' , because to have done so would have put it in conflict with the Constitution .   The government of the United Kingdom used the name `` Eire '' ( without the diacritic ) , and , from 1949 , `` Republic of Ireland '' , for the state"], [309, "Halloween is a 1978 American independent slasher film directed and scored by John Carpenter , co-written with producer Debra Hill , and starring Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis in her film debut . The film was the first installment in what has become the Halloween franchise . The plot is set in the fictional Midwestern town of Haddonfield , Illinois . On Halloween night in 1963 , a six-year-old Michael Myers dressed in a clown costume murders his teenage sister by stabbing her with a kitchen knife . Fifteen years later , Michael Myers , age 21 , escapes from a psychiatric hospital , returns home , and stalks Laurie Strode and her friends . Michael 's psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis suspects Michael 's intentions , and follows him to Haddonfield to try to prevent him from killing .   Halloween was produced on a budget of $ 300,000 and grossed $ 47 million at the box office in the United States , and $ 70 million worldwide , equivalent to $ 250 million as of 2014 , becoming one of the most profitable independent films . Many critics credit the film as the first in a long line of slasher films inspired by Alfred Hitchcock 's Psycho ( 1960 ) . Halloween had many imitators and originated several clichés found in low-budget horror films of the 1980s and 1990s . Unlike many of its imitators , Halloween contains little graphic violence and gore . It was one of the first horror films to introduce the concept of the killer dying and coming back to life again within the same film . In 2006 , it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' .   Some critics have suggested that Halloween may encourage sadism and misogyny by audiences identifying with its villain . Other critics have suggested the film is a social critique of the immorality of youth and teenagers in 1970s America , with many of Myers ' victims being sexually promiscuous substance abusers , while the lone heroine is depicted as innocent and pure , hence her survival . Nevertheless , Carpenter dismisses such analyses . Several of Halloweens techniques and plot elements , although not founded in this film , have nonetheless become standard slasher movie tropes . Halloween spawned seven sequels and was rebooted by Rob Zombie in 2007 . The first sequel to the original movie , Halloween II , was released in 1981 , three years after its predecessor .   Plot   On Halloween night of 1963 , six-year-old Michael Myers , dressed in a clown costume , stabs his teenage sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife . Fifteen years later , on October 30 , 1978 , he escapes from Smith 's Grove Sanitarium in a car that was to take him to a court hearing , the verdict of which was for him to be locked up forever .   The next day , 21-year-old Michael ( Nick Castle ) , now wearing a mechanic 's uniform and a white mask , returns to his hometown of Haddonfield , Illinois and begins stalking high school student Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) after she drops off a key at his old house so her father can sell it . Her two best friends Annie Brackett ( Nancy Loomis ) and Lynda van der Klok ( P. J. Soles ) dismiss Laurie 's concerns that someone is following her . Michael 's psychiatrist , Dr. Sam Loomis ( Donald Pleasence ) having anticipated Michael 's return home , goes to the local cemetery and finds Judith Myers ' headstone missing . Loomis meets with Annie 's father , Sheriff Leigh Brackett ( Charles Cyphers ) and monitors the local neighborhood to keep an eye out for Michael .   When Annie 's boyfriend Paul calls her to come pick him up , she takes Lindsey Wallace ( Kyle Richards ) to the Doyle house , just across the street , to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy Doyle ( Brian Andrews ) . After she gets into her car , Michael , who hid in the backseat , strangles Annie before slashing her throat . While playing hide-and-seek with Lindsey , Tommy sees Michael carrying Annie 's body into the Wallace house and thinks he is the `` boogeyman '' . He tries to tell a skeptical Laurie about what he saw . Later , Lynda and her boyfriend Bob enter the Wallace house to spend the night together . After having sex , Lynda asks Bob to go downstairs and"], [310, "The Hunting of the Snark ( An Agony in 8 Fits ) is typically categorized as a nonsense poem written by Lewis Carroll , the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson . Written from 1874 to 1876 , the poem borrows the setting , some creatures , and eight portmanteau words from Carroll 's earlier poem `` Jabberwocky '' in his children 's novel Through the Looking Glass ( 1871 ) .   Henry Holiday , the illustrator of the poem , thought of it as a `` tragedy '' .   The plot follows a crew of ten trying to hunt the Snark , an animal which may turn out to be a highly dangerous Boojum . The only one of the crew to find the Snark quickly vanishes , leading the narrator to explain that it was a Boojum after all . The poem is dedicated to young Gertrude Chataway , whom Carroll met at the English seaside town Sandown in the Isle of Wight in 1875 . Included with many copies of the first edition of the poem was Carroll 's religious tract , An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves `` Alice '' .   The Hunting of the Snark was published by Macmillan in the United Kingdom in late March 1876 , with illustrations by Henry Holiday . It had mixed reviews from reviewers who found it strange . The first printing of The Hunting of the Snark consisted of 10,000 copies . There were two reprintings by the conclusion of the year ; in total , the poem was reprinted 17 times between 1876 and 1908 . Carroll often denied knowing the meaning behind the poem ; however , in an 1896 reply to one letter , he agreed with one interpretation of the poem as an allegory for the search for happiness . Scholars have found various meanings in the poem , among them existential angst , an allegory for tuberculosis , and a mockery of the Tichborne case . The Hunting of the Snark has been alluded to in various works and has been adapted for musicals , opera , plays , and music .   Plot   Setting   The Hunting of the Snark shares its fictional setting with Lewis Carroll 's earlier poem `` Jabberwocky '' published in his children 's novel Through the Looking-Glass ( 1871 ) . Eight nonsense words from `` Jabberwocky '' appear in The Hunting of the Snark : bandersnatch , beamish , frumious , galumphing , jubjub , mimsiest ( which previously appeared as mimsy in `` Jabberwocky '' ) , outgrabe and uffish . In a letter to the mother of his young friend Gertrude Chataway , Carroll described the domain of the Snark as `` an island frequented by the Jubjub and the Bandersnatch—no doubt the very island where the Jabberwock was slain . ''   Characters   The crew consists of ten members , whose descriptions all begin with the letter B : a Bellman , the leader ; a `` Boots '' , who is the only member of the crew without an illustration ; a maker of Bonnets and Hoods ; a Barrister , who settles arguments among the crew ; a Broker , who can appraise the goods of the crew ; a Billiard-marker , who is greatly skilled ; a Banker , who possesses all of the crew 's money ; a Butcher , who can only kill beavers ; a Beaver , who makes lace and has saved the crew from disaster several times ; and a Baker , who can only bake wedding cake , forgets his belongings and his name , but possesses courage .

It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south : Luzon , Visayas , and Mindanao . The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City , both part of Metro Manila .   The Philippines ' location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons , but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world 's greatest biodiversity . The Philippines has an area of approximately 300000 km2 , and a population of more than 100 million with faster growth than any other east Asian country . It is the seventh-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world . An additional 12 million Filipinos live overseas , comprising one of the world 's largest diasporas . Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands . In prehistoric times , Negritos were some of the archipelago 's earliest inhabitants . They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples . Exchanges with Chinese , Malay , Indian , and Islamic states occurred . Then , various nations were established under the rule of Datus , Rajahs , Sultans or Lakans .   The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in Homonhon , Eastern Samar in 1521 marked the beginning of Hispanic colonization . In 1543 , Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain . With the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi from Mexico City , in 1565 , the first Hispanic settlement in the archipelago was established . The Philippines became part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years . This resulted in Roman Catholicism becoming the dominant religion . During this time , Manila became the western hub of the trans-Pacific trade connecting Asia with Acapulco in the Americas using Manila galleons .   As the 19th century gave way to the 20th , there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution , which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic , followed by the bloody Philippine–American War of conquest by US military force . Aside from the period of Japanese occupation , the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II , when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation . Since then , the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy , which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution .   The nation 's large population and economic potential have led it to be classified as a middle power . It is a founding member of the United Nations , World Trade Organization , Association of Southeast Asian Nations , the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum , and the East Asia Summit . It also hosts the headquarters of the Asian Development Bank . The Philippines is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country , which has an economy transitioning from being one based on agriculture to one based more on services and manufacturing . [ https : //www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html # Econ CIA World Factbook , Philippines ] , Retrieved May 15 , 2009 .   Etymology   The Philippines was named in honor of King Philip II of Spain . Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of Leyte and Samar Felipinas after the then Prince of Asturias . Eventually the name Las Islas Filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago . Before that became commonplace , other names such as Islas del Poniente ( Islands of the West ) and Magellan 's name for the islands San Lázaro were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands .   The official name of the Philippines has changed several times in the course of its history . During the Philippine Revolution , the Malolos Congress proclaimed the establishment of the República Filipina or the Philippine Republic . From the period of the Spanish–American War ( 1898 ) and the Philippine–American War ( 1899–1902 ) until the Commonwealth period ( 1935–46 ) , American colonial authorities referred to the country as the Philippine Islands , a translation of the Spanish name . From the 1898 Treaty of Paris , the name Philippines began to appear and it has since become the country 's common name . Since the end of World War"], [312, "The modern Olympic Games or Olympics ( ) are the leading international sporting event featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions . The Olympic Games are considered to be the world 's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating . The Olympic Games are held every four years , with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart .   Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games , which were held in Olympia , Greece , from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD . Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 1894 . The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement , with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority .   The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games . Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports , the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability , and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes . The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic , political , and technological advancements . As a result , the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism , as envisioned by Coubertin , to allowing participation of professional athletes . The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games . World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916 , 1940 , and 1944 Games . Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games .   The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations ( IFs ) , National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) , and organizing committees for each specific Olympic Games . As the decision-making body , the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games , and organizes and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter . The IOC also determines the Olympic program , consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games . There are several Olympic rituals and symbols , such as the Olympic flag and torch , as well as the opening and closing ceremonies . Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events . The first , second , and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals : gold , silver , and bronze , respectively .   The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented . This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies , including boycotts , doping , bribery , and a terrorist attack in 1972 . Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame . The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world .   Ancient Olympics   The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia , Greece . Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece . These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration , horse and chariot racing events . It has been widely written that during the Games , all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished . This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce . This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars . The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were traveling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus . The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend ; one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games . According to legend , it was Heracles who first called the Games `` Olympic '' and established the custom of holding them every four years . The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labors , he built the Olympic Stadium as an honor to Zeus . Following its completion , he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a `` stadion '' ( , Latin : stadium , `` stage '' ) , which later became a unit of distance . The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is"], [313, "Futbol Club Barcelona , commonly known as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça , is a professional football club , based in Barcelona , Catalonia , Spain .   Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss , English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper , the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism , hence the motto `` Més que un club '' ( More than a club ) . Unlike many other football clubs , the supporters own and operate Barcelona . It is the second most valuable sports team in the world , worth $ 3.56 billion , and the world 's second richest football club in terms of revenue , with an annual turnover of €560.8 million . The official Barcelona anthem is the `` Cant del Barça '' , written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs .   Domestically , Barcelona has won 24 La Liga , 28 Copa del Rey , 11 Supercopa de España , 3 Copa Eva Duarte and 2 Copa de la Liga trophies , as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions . In international club football , Barcelona has won five UEFA Champions League titles , a record four UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup , a shared record five UEFA Super Cup , a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and a record three FIFA Club World Cup trophies . Barcelona was ranked first in the IFFHS Club World Ranking for 1997 , 2009 , 2011 , 2012 and 2015 and currently occupies the third position on the UEFA club rankings . The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid ; matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico .   Barcelona is one of the most supported teams in the world , and has the largest social media following in the world among sports teams . Barcelona 's players have won a record number of Ballon d'Or awards ( 11 ) , as well as a record number of FIFA World Player of the Year awards ( 7 ) . In 2010 , the club made history when three players who came through its youth academy ( Messi , Iniesta and Xavi ) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards , an unprecedented feat for players from the same football school .   Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division , along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid . In 2009 , Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga , Copa del Rey , and the UEFA Champions League , and also became the first football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year , completing the sextuple in also winning the Spanish Super Cup , UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup . In 2011 , the club became European champions again and won five trophies . This Barcelona team , which reached a record six consecutive Champions League semi-finals and won 14 trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola , is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time . In June 2015 , Barcelona became the first European club in history to achieve the continental treble twice .   History   Beginnings of FC Barcelona ( 1899–1922 )   On 22 October 1899 , Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club ; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November . Eleven players attended — Walter Wild ( the first director of the club ) , Lluís d'Ossó , Bartomeu Terradas , Otto Kunzle , Otto Maier , Enric Ducal , Pere Cabot , Carles Pujol , Josep Llobet , John Parsons , and William Parsons — and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born .   FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups , competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey . In 1902 , the club won its first trophy , the Copa Macaya , and participated in the first Copa del Rey , losing 1–2 to Bizcaya in the final . Hans Gamper — now known as Joan Gamper — became club president in 1908 , finding the club in financial difficulty after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905 . Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925 , he spent 25 years in total at the helm . One of his main"], [314, "Chinese culture ( ) is one of the world 's oldest cultures , traces back to thousands and thousands of years ago . The area in which the culture is dominant covers a large geographical region in eastern Asia with customs and traditions varying greatly between provinces , cities , and even towns as well . Important components of Chinese culture includes ceramics , architecture , music , literature , martial arts , cuisine , visual arts , philosophy and religion .   Identity   There are 56 officially recognized ethnic groups in China . In terms of numbers however , Han Chinese is by far the largest group . Throughout history , many groups have merged into neighboring ethnicities or disappeared . At the same time , many within the Han identity have maintained distinct linguistic and regional cultural traditions . The term Zhonghua Minzu has been used to describe the notion of Chinese nationalism in general . Much of the traditional identity within the community has to do with distinguishing the family name .   Regional   Traditional Chinese Culture covers large geographical territories , where each region is usually divided into distinct sub-cultures . Each region is often represented by three ancestral items . For example , Guangdong is represented by chenpi , aged ginger and hay . Others include ancient cities like Lin'an ( Hangzhou ) , which include tea leaf , bamboo shoot trunk , and hickory nut . Such distinctions give rise to the old Chinese proverb : `` '' ( Shí lǐ bù tóng fēng , bǎi lǐ bù tóng sú ) , literally `` the praxis vary within ten li , customs vary within a hundred li . '' ''   Society   Structure   Since the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors period , some form of Chinese monarch has been the main ruler above all . Different periods of history have different names for the various positions within society . Conceptually each imperial or feudal period is similar , with the government and military officials ranking high in the hierarchy , and the rest of the population under regular Chinese law . From the late Zhou Dynasty ( 1046–256 BCE ) onwards , traditional Chinese society was organized into a hierarchic system of socio-economic classes known as the four occupations .   However , this system did not cover all social groups while the distinctions between all groups became blurred ever since the commercialization of Chinese culture in the Song Dynasty ( 960–1279 CE ) . Ancient Chinese education also has a long history ; ever since the Sui Dynasty ( 581–618 CE ) educated candidates prepared for the Imperial examinations which drafted exam graduates into government as scholar-bureaucrats .   This led to the creation of a meritocracy , although success was available only to males who could afford test preparation . Imperial examinations required applicants to write essays and demonstrate mastery of the Confucian classics . Those who passed the highest level of the exam became elite scholar-officials known as jinshi , a highly esteemed socio-economic position . A major mythological structure developed around the topic of the mythology of the imperial exams . Trades and crafts were usually taught by a shifu . The female historian Ban Zhao wrote the Lessons for Women in the Han Dynasty and outlined the four virtues women must abide to , while scholars such as Zhu Xi and Cheng Yi would expand upon this . Chinese marriage and Taoist sexual practices are some of the rituals and customs found in society .   Values   Most social values are derived from Confucianism and Taoism . The subject of which school was the most influential is always debated as many concepts such as Neo-Confucianism , Buddhism and many others have come about . Reincarnation and other rebirth concept is a reminder of the connection between real-life and the after-life . In Chinese business culture , the concept of guanxi , indicating the primacy of relations over rules , has been well documented .   Confucianism was the official philosophy throughout most of Imperial China 's history , and mastery of Confucian texts was the primary criterion for entry into the imperial bureaucracy . A number of more authoritarian strains of thought have also been influential , such as Legalism .   There was often conflict between the philosophies , e.g . the Song Dynasty Neo-Confucians believed Legalism departed from the original spirit of Confucianism . Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today . In recent years , a number of New Confucians ( not to be confused with Neo-Confucianism ) have advocated that democratic ideals"], [315, "Paul Gardner Allen ( born January 21 , 1953 ) is an American businessman , philanthropist , investor , musician , and innovator , best known as the co-founder of Microsoft , alongside Bill Gates . As of March 2016 , he was estimated to be the 45th richest person in the world , with an estimated wealth of $ 17.7 billion .   Allen is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Inc. , which manages his various business and philanthropic efforts . Allen also has a multibillion-dollar investment portfolio including technology and media companies , real estate holdings , and stakes in other companies . He owns two professional sports teams , the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League and the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association . He is also part-owner of the Seattle Sounders FC , which in 2009 , joined Major League Soccer .   He is also the founder of Allen Institute for Brain Science , Institute for Artificial Intelligence , Institute for Cell Science and Vulcan Aerospace .   Early life and education   Paul Allen was born on January 21 , 1953 in Seattle , Washington to Kenneth Sam Allen and Edna Faye ( née Gardner ) Allen . Allen attended Lakeside School , a private school in Seattle , where he befriended Bill Gates , three years younger , with whom he shared an enthusiasm for computers . They used Lakeside 's Teletype terminal to develop their programming skills on several time-sharing computer systems . After graduation , Allen went to Washington State University , where he joined Phi Kappa Theta fraternity , but dropped out after two years in order to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston , near where Bill Gates had ended up as well . Allen later convinced Gates to drop out of Harvard University in order to create Microsoft .   Microsoft    In Albuquerque , New Mexico , Paul Allen with his friend Bill Gates , in 1975 , began marketing a BASIC programming language interpreter . Allen came up with the original name of `` Micro-Soft , '' as recounted in a 1995 Fortune magazine article . In 1980 , after promising to deliver IBM a Disk Operating System ( DOS ) they had not yet developed for the Intel 8088-based IBM PC , Allen spearheaded a deal for Microsoft to purchase a Quick and Dirty Operating System ( QDOS ) which was written by Tim Paterson who , at the time , was employed at Seattle Computer Products . As a result of this transaction , Microsoft was able to secure a contract to supply the DOS that would eventually run on IBM 's PC line . This contract with IBM was the watershed in Microsoft history that led to Allen 's and Gates ' wealth and success . Allen effectively left Microsoft in 1982 due to serious illness . Allen officially resigned from his position on the Microsoft board of directors in November 2000 but was asked to consult as a senior strategy advisor to the company 's executives and still owns a reported 100 million shares .   Business ventures and investments   Financial and technology   * Vulcan Capital is an investment-arm of Allen 's Seattle-based Vulcan Inc. , which manages his personal fortune .

Among many others who claimed to have made the discovery were Zacharias Janssen , a spectacle-maker in Middelburg , and Jacob Metius of Alkmaar . The design of these early refracting telescopes consisted of a convex objective lens and a concave eyepiece . Galileo used this design the following year . In 1611 , Johannes Kepler described how a telescope could be made with a convex objective lens and a convex eyepiece lens and by 1655 astronomers such as Christiaan Huygens were building powerful but unwieldy Keplerian telescopes with compound eyepieces . Hans Lippershey is the earliest person documented to have applied for a patent for the device .   Isaac Newton is credited with building the first `` practical '' reflector in 1668 with a design that incorporated a small flat diagonal mirror to reflect the light to an eyepiece mounted on the side of the telescope . Laurent Cassegrain in 1672 described the design of a reflector with a small convex secondary mirror to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror .   The achromatic lens , which greatly reduced color aberrations in objective lenses and allowed for shorter and more functional telescopes , first appeared in a 1733 telescope made by Chester Moore Hall , who did not publicize it . John Dollond learned of Hall 's invention and began producing telescopes using it in commercial quantities , starting in 1758 .   Important developments in reflecting telescopes were John Hadley 's production of larger paraboloidal mirrors in 1721 ; the process of silvering glass mirrors introduced by Léon Foucault in 1857 ; and the adoption of long lasting aluminized coatings on reflector mirrors in 1932. the Ritchey-Chretien variant of Cassegrain reflector was invented around 1910 , but not widely adopted until after 1950 ; many modern telescopes including the Hubble Space Telescope use this design , which gives a wider field of view than a classic Cassegrain .   During the period 1850-1900 , reflectors suffered from problems with speculum metal mirrors , and a considerable number of `` Great Refractors '' were built from 60 cm to 1 metre aperture , culminating in the Yerkes Observatory refractor in 1897 ; however , starting from the early 1900s a series of ever-larger reflectors with glass mirrors were built , including the Mount Wilson 60-inch , the 100-inch ( 2.5 metre ) Hooker Telescope ( 1917 ) and the 200-inch ( 5 metre ) Hale telescope ( 1948 ) ; essentially all major research telescopes since 1900 have been reflectors . A number of 4-metre class ( 160 inch ) telescopes were built on superior higher altitude sites including Hawaii and the Chilean desert in the 1975-1985 era . The development of the computer-controlled alt-azimuth mount in the 1970s and active optics in the 1980s enabled a new generation of even larger telescopes , starting with the 10-metre ( 400 inch ) Keck telescopes in 1993/1996 , and a number of 8-metre telescopes including the ESO Very Large Telescope , Gemini Observatory and Subaru Telescope .   The era of radio telescopes ( along with radio astronomy ) was born with Karl Guthe Jansky 's serendipitous discovery of an astronomical radio source in 1931 . Many types of telescopes were developed in the 20th century for a wide range of wavelengths from radio to gamma-rays . The development of space observatories after 1960 allowed access  to several bands impossible to observe from the ground , including X-rays and longer wavelength infrared bands .   Optical telescopes   Invention   Optical foundations   Lenses and their properties were known well before the invention of the optical telescope ; simple lenses made from rock crystal have been known from before recorded history . Ptolemy ( in his work Optics written in the 2nd century AD ) wrote about the properties of light including reflection , refraction , and color . During the 10th century , the Persian scholar Ibn Sahl , was to make some of the most refined descriptions in respect to optics at the time .   It was approximately from the 12th century in Europe that 'reading stones ' ( magnifying lenses placed on the reading material ) were well documented—as well as the use of lenses as burning glasses . It is generally considered that spectacles for correcting long sightedness with convex lenses were invented in Northern Italy in the late 13th to early 14th century , and the invention of the use of concave lenses to correct near-sightedness is ascribed to Nicholas of Cusa in 1451 . Thus , early knowledge of lenses and the"], [317, "The Absheron Peninsula ( ) is a peninsula in Azerbaijan . It is host to Baku , the biggest and the most populous city of the country , and also the Baku metropolitan area , with its satellite cities Sumgayit and Khyrdalan .   There are three districts , of which two are urban ( Baku and Sumgayit ) , and one ( Absheron Rayon ) , is suburban district in Absheron region .   It extends 60 km eastward into the Caspian Sea , and reaches a maximum width of 30 km . Though technically the easternmost extension of the Caucasus Mountains , the landscape is only mildly hilly , a gently undulating plain that ends in a long spit of sand dunes known as Shah Dili , and now declared the Absheron National Park . In this part the peninsula is dissected by ravines and characterized by frequent salt lakes .   Etymology   The etymology is as follows : The word Absheron consists of a few parts . Ab means water , shour means salty and an is the suffix that makes plural in Persian . So , Abshouran , which came out these words , means `` place of salty water '' . This is also the name of a city in Russia which is called Apsheronsk .   According to Conrad Malte-Brun in 1810 , an alternative name for the peninsula was Okoressa .   Geography   The Absheron Peninsula is nearly the metropolitan area of Baku because the Baku metropolitan area consists of Baku city , Sumgayit and Khyrdalan whereas the Absheron Peninsula consists of Baku city , Sumgayit and Absheron rayon whose center is Khyrdalan .   Climate   The Absheron Peninsula , has a temperate semi-arid climate ( Köppen climate classification : BSk ) with warm and dry summers , cool and occasionally wet winters , and strong winds all year long . The peninsula is the most arid part of Azerbaijan ( precipitation here is around or less than 200 mm a year ) . The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer , but none of these seasons are particularly wet . The natural vegetation of the Absheron Peninsula is dry steppe and semi-desert . Due to the semi-arid climate , local agriculture requires irrigation .   Economy   Beginning in the 1870s , the Absheron Peninsula was the site of some of the world 's earliest petroleum production . Much of the landscape remains scarred with rusting oil derricks . Despite serious problems with environmental damage and pollution , the Absheron is known for its flowers , horticulture , mulberries and figs . The northern coast has wide though less-than-pristine beaches which are popular local tourist attractions .   Wealthy people have settled in the Absheron Peninsula , including Robert Nobel and Zeynalabdin Taghiyev ."], [318, "George Walker Bush ( born July 6 , 1946 ) is an American politician who served as the 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 and 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000 . The eldest son of Barbara and George H. W. Bush , he was born in New Haven , Connecticut . After graduating from Yale University in 1968 and Harvard Business School in 1975 , he worked in oil businesses . He married Laura Welch in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives shortly thereafter . He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards in the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election . He was elected president in 2000 after a close and controversial election against Al Gore , becoming the fourth president to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than an opponent . He is the second president to have been the son of a former president , the first having been John Quincy Adams . He is also the brother of Jeb Bush , a former Governor of Florida and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 presidential election .   Eight months into Bush 's first term as president , the September 11 terrorist attacks occurred . Bush responded with what became known as the Bush Doctrine : launching a `` War on Terror '' , an international military campaign which included the war in Afghanistan , in 2001 , and the Iraq War , in 2003 . He also promoted policies on the economy , health care , education , social security reform , and amending the Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage . He signed into law broad tax cuts , the Patriot Act , the No Child Left Behind Act , the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act , Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors , and funding for the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR . His tenure saw national debates on immigration , Social Security , electronic surveillance , and torture .   Bush successfully ran for re-election against Democratic Senator John Kerry in 2004 , in another relatively close election . After his re-election , Bush received increasingly heated criticism from across the political spectrum Baker , Kevin , for his handling of the Iraq War , Hurricane Katrina , and other challenges . Amid this criticism , the Democratic Party regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections . In December 2007 , the United States entered its longest post-World War II recession , often referred to as the `` Great Recession '' , prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional passage of multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country 's financial system . Nationally , Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history , having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks , as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the 2008 financial crisis . He was met with public protests during visits to the United Kingdom .   Bush left office in 2009 , returning to Texas where he purchased a home in suburban Dallas . He is currently a public speaker , and has written a memoir , Decision Points . His presidential library was opened in 2013 . His presidency has been ranked among the worst in surveys of presidential scholars published in the late 2000s and 2010s .   Childhood to mid-life   Early life and education   George Walker Bush was born on July 6 , 1946 , at Grace-New Haven Hospital ( now Yale–New Haven Hospital ) in New Haven , Connecticut , as the first child of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce . He was raised in Midland and Houston , Texas , with four siblings , Jeb , Neil , Marvin and Dorothy . Another younger sister , Robin , died from leukemia at the age of three in 1953 . His grandfather , Prescott Bush , was a U.S . Senator from Connecticut . His father , George H.W . Bush , was Ronald Reagan 's Vice President from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. President from 1989 to 1993 . Bush has English and some German ancestry , along with more distant Dutch , Welsh , Irish , French , and Scottish roots .

He is the longest-serving consort of a reigning British monarch and the oldest-ever male member of the British royal family .   A member of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg , Philip was born into the Greek and Danish royal families . He was born in Greece but his family was exiled from the country when he was still an infant . After being educated in France , Germany , and the United Kingdom , he joined the Royal Navy in 1939 , at the age of 18 . From July 1939 , he began corresponding with the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth ( his third cousin through Queen Victoria and second cousin once removed through Christian IX of Denmark ) , whom he had first met in 1934 . During World War II he served with the Mediterranean and Pacific fleets .   After the war , Philip was granted permission by George VI to marry Elizabeth . Before the official announcement of their engagement , he abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles and became a naturalised British subject , adopting the surname Mountbatten from his maternal grandparents . After an engagement of five months , he married Elizabeth on 20 November 1947 . Just before the wedding , the King granted him the style of His Royal Highness and the title Duke of Edinburgh . Philip left active military service when Elizabeth became Queen in 1952 , having reached the rank of commander . His wife made him a prince of the United Kingdom in 1957 .   Philip has four children with Elizabeth : Prince Charles , Princess Anne , Prince Andrew , and Prince Edward . He has eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren . Through a British Order in Council issued in 1960 , descendants of Philip and Elizabeth not bearing royal styles and titles can use the surname Mountbatten-Windsor , which has also been used by some members of the royal family who do hold titles , such as Charles and Anne .   A keen sports enthusiast , Philip helped develop the equestrian event of carriage driving . He is a patron of over 800 organisations and serves as chairman of the Duke of Edinburgh 's Award scheme for people aged 14 to 24 .   Early life   Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921 , the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg . Philip 's four elder sisters were Margarita , Theodora , Cecilie , and Sophie . He was baptised into the Greek Orthodox Church . His godparents were Queen Olga of Greece ( his paternal grandmother ) and the Mayor of Corfu .   Shortly after Philip 's birth , his maternal grandfather , Prince Louis of Battenberg , then known as Louis Mountbatten , Marquess of Milford Haven , died in London . Louis was a naturalised British citizen , who , after a career in the Royal Navy , had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War . After visiting London for the memorial , Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the Greco-Turkish War ( 1919–1922 ) .   The war went badly for Greece , and the Turks made large gains . On 22 September 1922 , Philip 's uncle , King Constantine I , was forced to abdicate , and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew , along with others . The commander of the army , General Georgios Hatzianestis , and five senior politicians were executed . Prince Andrew 's life was believed to be in danger , and Alice was under surveillance . In December , a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life . The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew 's family , with Philip carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box . Philip 's family went to France , where they settled in the Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud in a house lent to them by his wealthy aunt , Princess George of Greece and Denmark .   Because he left the country as a baby , he does not have a strong grasp of Greek . In 1992 , Philip said that he `` could understand a certain amount of '' the language .   Youth"], [320, "Mykonos ( , ; ) is a Greek island , part of the Cyclades , lying between Tinos , Syros , Paros and Naxos . The island spans an area of and rises to an elevation of 341 m at its highest point . There are 10,134 inhabitants ( 2011 census ) , most of whom live in the largest town , Mykonos , which lies on the west coast . The town is also known as Chora ( i.e . the Town in Greek , following the common practice in Greece when the name of the island itself is the same as the name of the principal town ) .   Mykonos ' nickname is The island of the winds . Tourism is a major industry and Mykonos is well known for its vibrant nightlife and for being a gay-friendly destination with many establishments catering for the LGBT community .   History   Archaeological findings suggest the presence of the Neolithic tribe , Kares on the island in 3000 BC , but the first real settlers seem to be the Ionians from Athens in the early 11th century BC . There were many people living on the neighbouring island of Delos , just 2 km away , which meant that Mykonos became an important place for supplies and transit . It was , however , during ancient times a rather poor island with limited agricultural resources and only two towns . Its inhabitants were polytheists and worshipped many gods .   Mykonos came under the control of the Romans during the reign of the Roman Empire and then became part of the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century . In 1204 , with the fall of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade , Mykonos was occupied by Andrea Ghisi , a relative of the Doge of Venice . The island was ravaged by the Catalans at the end of the 13th century and finally given over to direct Venetian rule in 1390 .   In 1537 , while the Venetians still reigned , Mykonos was attacked by Hayreddin Barbarossa , the infamous admiral of Suleiman the Magnificent , and an Ottoman fleet established itself on the island . The Ottomans , under the leadership of Kapudan Pasha , imposed a system of self-governance comprising a governor and an appointed council of syndics . When the castle of Tinos fell to the Ottomans in 1718 , the last of the Venetians withdrew from the region .   Up until the end of the 18th century , Mykonos prospered as a trading centre , attracting many immigrants from nearby islands , in addition to regular pirate raids . In June 1794 the Battle of Mykonos was fought between British and French ships in the island 's main harbour .   The Greek Revolution against the Ottoman Empire broke out in 1821 and Mykonos played an important role , led by the national heroine , Manto Mavrogenous . Mavrogenous , a well-educated aristocrat guided by the ideas of the Enlightenment , sacrificed her family 's fortune for the Greek cause . Greece became an independent state in 1830 . A statue of her sits in the middle of Mando Mavrogenous square in the main town .   As a result of sailing and merchant activity , the island 's economy quickly picked up but declined again during the late 19th century and especially after the opening of the Corinth Canal in 1904 and the First World War at the beginning of the 20th century . Many Mykonians left the island to find work in mainland Greece and many foreign countries , especially the United States .   Tourism soon came to dominate the local economy , owing a lot to the important excavations carried out by the French School of Archaeology , which began work in Delos in 1873 .   In the 1930s many famous artists , politicians and wealthy Europeans began spending their vacations on the island and Mykonos quickly became an international hot spot . Temporarily suspended during the Second World War , tourists once again rushed to Mykonos ' luxurious shores in the 1950s and have not stopped since .   Mythology   In Greek mythology , the Mykonos was named after its first ruler , Mykons , the son or grandson of the god Apollo and a local hero . The island is also said to have been the location of a great battle between Zeus and Titans and where Hercules killed the invincible giants having lured them from the protection of Mount Olympus . It is even said that the large rocks all over the island are the petrified testicles ( or , in bowdlerized"], [321, "A steak is a meat generally sliced perpendicular to the muscle fibers , potentially including a bone . Exceptions , in which the meat is sliced parallel to the fibers , include the skirt steak that is cut from the plate , the flank steak that is cut from the abdominal muscles , and the Silverfinger steak that is cut from the loin and includes three rib bones . When the word `` steak '' is used without qualification , it generally refers to a beefsteak . In a larger sense , there are also fish steaks , ground meat steaks , pork steak and many more varieties .   Steaks are usually grilled , but they can be pan-fried , or broiled . Steak is often grilled in an attempt to replicate the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire . Steak can also be cooked in sauce , such as in steak and kidney pie , or minced and formed into patties , such as hamburgers .   Steaks are also cut from grazing animals , usually farmed , other than cattle , including bison , camel , goat , horse , kangaroo , sheep , ostrich , pigs , reindeer , turkey and deer , as well as various types of fish , especially salmon and large pelagic fish such as swordfish , shark and marlin . For some meats , such as pork , lamb and mutton , chevon and veal , these cuts are often referred to as chops . Some cured meat , such as gammon , is commonly served as steak .   Grilled Portobello mushroom may be called mushroom steak , and similarly for other vegetarian dishes . Imitation steak is a food product that is formed into a steak shape from various pieces of meat , while fruits such as watermelon can be grilled and described as `` watermelon steak '' because of their shape and color .   Etymology   The word steak originates from the mid-15th century Scandinavian word steik , or stickna in the Middle English dialect , along with the Old Norse word steikja . The Oxford English Dictionary 's first reference is to `` a thick slice of meat cut for roasting or grilling or frying , sometimes used in a pie or pudding ; especially a piece cut from the hind-quarters of the animal . '' Subsequent parts of the entry , however , refer to `` steak fish '' , which referred to `` cod of a size suitable for cutting into steaks '' , and also `` steak-raid '' , which was a custom among Scottish Highlanders of giving some cattle being driven through a gentleman 's land to the owner . An early written usage of the word `` stekys '' comes from a 15th-century cookbook , and makes reference to both beef or venison steaks .   Production   Livestock for meat to be used as steak cuts may be raised on a farm or ranch . The meat from various wild game may also be used for steak cuts .   The trade in steaks from bushmeat is a serious threat to biodiversity , as commercial harvesting could endanger species .

Houseboat rafts with rearing cages underneath .   Marketing and sales   Countries with enough suitable land for grazing animals , in particular cattle , have a history of production and culinary use of steak . Such countries include Argentina , Ireland , New Zealand , Australia , South Africa , the United States and the United Kingdom . In Asian countries , such as China and Korea , steak is traditionally sliced and stir-fried and served in smaller amounts as part of a mixed dish . `` Chinese peasants had already mastered the richly varied environment and knew every edible part of it , which helped them to withstand famine . The stir-fry technique conserved precious firewood and enabled cooks to be exceedingly adaptable . ''   Argentina   In Argentina , beef represents a large portion of the country 's export market . A total of 11.8 million animals were slaughtered in 2010 . The country has one of the largest consumptions of beef per capita worldwide , and much of it is barbecued steak . Beef steak consumption is described as part of the `` Argentine national identity '' . In 2010 , there were 244,000 cattle"], [322, "The London Underground ( also known simply as the Underground , or by its nickname the Tube ) is a public rapid transit system serving Greater London and some adjacent parts of the counties of Buckinghamshire , Essex and Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom .   The world 's first underground railway , the Metropolitan Railway , which opened in 1863 , is now part of the Circle , Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines ; the first line to operate underground electric traction trains , the City & South London Railway in 1890 , is now part of the Northern line . The network has expanded to 11 lines , and in 2015–16 carried 1.34 billion passengers , making it the world 's 11th busiest metro system .   The system 's first tunnels were built just below the surface , using the cut-and-cover method ; later , smaller , roughly circular tunnels – which gave rise to its nickname , the Tube – were dug through at a deeper level . The system has 270 stations and 250 mi of track . Despite its name , only 45 % of the system is actually underground in tunnels , with much of the network in the outer environs of London being on the surface . In addition , the Underground does not cover most southern parts of Greater London , with less than 10 % of the stations located south of the River Thames .   The early tube lines , originally owned by several private companies , were brought together under the `` '' brand in the early 20th century and eventually merged along with the sub-surface lines and bus services in 1933 to form London Transport under the control of the London Passenger Transport Board ( LPTB ) . The current operator , London Underground Limited ( LUL ) , is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London ( TfL ) , the statutory corporation responsible for the transport network in Greater London . , 92 % of operational expenditure is covered by passenger fares . The Travelcard ticket was introduced in 1983 and Oyster , a contactless ticketing system , in 2003 . Contactless card payments were introduced in 2014 .   The LPTB was a prominent patron of art and design , commissioning many new station buildings , posters and public artworks in a modernist style . The schematic Tube map , designed by Harry Beck in 1931 , was voted a national design icon in 2006 and now includes other TfL transport systems such as the Docklands Light Railway , London Overground and TfL Rail . Other famous London Underground branding includes the roundel and Johnston typeface , created by Edward Johnston in 1916 .   History   Early years   The idea of an underground railway linking the City of London with some of the railway termini in its urban centre was proposed in the 1830s , and the Metropolitan Railway was granted permission to build such a line in 1854 . To prepare construction , a short test tunnel was built in 1855 in Kibblesworth , a small town with geological properties similar to London . This test tunnel was used for two years in the development of the first underground train , and was later , in 1861 , filled up . The world 's first underground railway , it opened in January 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives . It was hailed as a success , carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day , and borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service . The Metropolitan District Railway ( commonly known as the District Railway ) opened in December 1868 from South Kensington to Westminster as part of a plan for an underground `` inner circle '' connecting London 's main-line termini . The Metropolitan and District railways completed the Circle line in 1884 , built using the cut and cover method . Both railways expanded , the District building five branches to the west reaching Ealing , Hounslow , Uxbridge , Richmond and Wimbledon and the Metropolitan eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire , more than 50 mi from Baker Street and the centre of London .   For the first deep-level tube line , the City and South London Railway , two 10 ft diameter circular tunnels were dug between King William Street ( close to today 's Monument station ) and Stockwell , under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface . This opened in 1890 with electric locomotives that hauled carriages with small opaque windows , nicknamed padded cells ."], [323, "|Circles of 9 and 12 - The 108 Human Types  |Circles of 9 and 12 - The 108 Human Types   In Western astrology , astrological signs are the twelve 30° sectors of the ecliptic , starting at the vernal equinox ( one of the intersections of the ecliptic with the celestial equator ) , also known as the First Point of Aries . The order of the astrological signs is Aries , Taurus , Gemini , Cancer , Leo , Virgo , Libra , Scorpio , Sagittarius , Capricorn , Aquarius and Pisces .   The concept of the zodiac originated in Babylonian astrology , and was later influenced by Hellenistic culture . According to astrology , celestial phenomena relate to human activity on the principle of `` as above , so below '' , so that the signs are held to represent characteristic modes of expression .   The twelve sector division of the ecliptic constitutes astrology 's primary frame of reference when considering the positions of celestial bodies , from a geocentric point of view , so that we may find , for instance , the Sun in 23° Aries ( 23° longitude ) , the Moon in 7° Scorpio ( 217° longitude ) , or Jupiter in 29° Pisces ( 359° longitude ) . Beyond the celestial bodies , other astrological points that are dependent on geographical location and time ( namely , the Ascendant , the Midheaven , the Vertex and the houses ' cusps ) are also referenced within this ecliptic coordinate system .   Various approaches to measuring and dividing the sky are currently used by differing systems of astrology , although the tradition of the Zodiac 's names and symbols remain consistent . Western astrology measures from Equinox and Solstice points ( points relating to equal , longest and shortest days of the tropical year ) , while Jyotiṣa or Vedic astrology measures along the equatorial plane ( sidereal year ) . Precession results in Western astrology 's zodiacal divisions not corresponding in the current era to the constellations that carry similar names , while Jyotiṣa measurements still correspond with the background constellations .   In Western and Asian astrology , the emphasis is on space , and the movement of the Sun , Moon and planets in the sky through each of the zodiac signs . In Chinese astrology , by contrast , the emphasis is on time , with the zodiac operating on cycles of years , months , and hours of the day .  A common feature of all three traditions however , is the significance of the Ascendant — the zodiac sign that is rising ( due to the rotation of the earth ) on the eastern horizon at the moment of a person 's birth .   Western zodiac signs   Zodiac history and symbolism   While Western astrology is essentially a product of Greco-Roman culture , some of its more basic concepts originated in Babylonia . Isolated references to celestial `` signs '' in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac . Specifically , the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction .   By the 4th century BC , Babylonians ' astronomy and their system of celestial omens were influencing the Greek culture and , by the late 2nd century BC , Egyptian astrology was also mixing in . This resulted , unlike the Mesopotamian tradition , in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of horoscopic astrology , employing the use of the Ascendant ( the rising degree of the ecliptic , at the time of birth ) , and of the twelve houses . Association of the astrological signs with Empedocles ' four classical elements was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs .   The body of astrological knowledge by the 2nd century AD is described in Ptolemy 's Tetrabiblos , a work that was responsible for astrology 's successful spread across Europe and the Middle East , and remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings .   The following table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude , with the Latin names ( still widely used ) and the English translation ( gloss ) . The longitude intervals , being a mathematical division , are closed for the first endpoint ( a ) and open for the second ( b ) — for instance , 30° of longitude is the first point of Taurus , not part of Aries .

She was the youngest of eight daughters , and she inherited her father 's farm , now called Mary Arden 's House , in Wilmcote , Warwickshire when Robert Arden died in December 1556 .   Richard Shakespeare , the father of John Shakespeare , was a tenant farmer on land owned by her father in Snitterfield .

Their second daughter , Margaret , also died in infancy . Some members of the wider Arden family were of the Catholic faith .   Mary was from a family of status and her ancestors had connections in society , such as Thomas Arden , who fought in the thirteenth-century civil war for the Barons and Simon de Montfort ; Robert Arden who fought in the War of Roses ; John Arden who served on the court of King Henry VII . Upon her father 's death , Mary inherited land in Snitterfield and Wilmcote .   Mary Arden 's House in Wilmcote has been maintained in good condition because it had been a working farmhouse over the centuries . It was bought by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in 1930 and refurnished in the Tudor period style .  In 2000 it was discovered that the building preserved as Mary Arden 's house had belonged to a friend and neighbour Adam Palmer and the house was renamed Palmer 's Farm . The house that had belonged to the Arden family which was near to Palmer 's Farm had been acquired by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in 1968 for preservation as part of a farmyard without knowing its true provenance .

The annual formal ceremony and dinner at which the awards are presented are a major part of the film industry 's awards season , which culminates each year with the Academy Awards .   The 73rd Golden Globe Awards , honouring the best in film and television in 2015 , were broadcast live on January 10 , 2016 . Ricky Gervais hosted the show for the fourth time .   History   In 1943 , a group of writers banded together to form the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , and by creating a generously distributed award called the Golden Globe Award , they now play a significant role in film marketing . The 1st Golden Globe Awards , honoring the best achievements in 1943 filmmaking , was held in January 1944 , at the 20th Century-Fox studios . Subsequent ceremonies were held at various venues throughout the next decade , including the Beverly Hills Hotel , and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel .   In 1950 , the Hollywood Foreign Press Association made the decision to establish a special honorary award to recognize outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry . Recognizing its subject as an international figure within the entertainment industry , the first award was presented to director and producer , Cecil B. DeMille . The official name of the award thus became the Cecil B. DeMille Award .   In 1963 , the Miss Golden Globe concept was introduced . In its inaugural year , two Miss Golden Globes were named , one for film and one for television . The two Miss Golden Globes named that year were Eva Six ( of the films Operation Bikini and Beach Party ) and Donna Douglas ( of television 's The Beverly Hillbillies ) , respectively .   In 2009 , the Golden Globe statuette was redesigned ( but not for the first time in its history ) . The New York firm Society Awards collaborated for a year with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to produce a statuette that included a unique marble and enhanced the statuette ’ s quality and gold content . It was unveiled at a press conference at the Beverly Hilton prior to the show .   Revenues generated from the annual ceremony have enabled the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to donate millions of dollars to entertainment-related charities , as well as funding scholarships and other programs for future film and television professionals . The most prominent beneficiary being the Young Artist Awards , presented annually by the Young Artist Foundation , established in 1978 by late Hollywood Foreign Press member , Maureen Dragone to recognize and award excellence of young Hollywood performers under the age of 21 , and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically and/or financially challenged .

It is similar to ( and sometimes indistinguishable from ) a hematoma , commonly called a bruise , though the terms are not interchangeable in careful usage . Specifically , bruises are caused by trauma whereas ecchymoses , which are the same as the spots of purpura except larger , are not necessarily caused by trauma , often being caused by pathophysiologic cell function .   A broader definition of ecchymosis is the escape of blood into the tissues from ruptured blood vessels . The term also applies to the subcutaneous discoloration resulting from seepage of blood within the contused tissue .   Signs and symptoms   Hematomas can be subdivided by size . By definition , ecchymoses are 1 centimeter in size or larger , and are therefore larger than petechiae ( less than 2 millimeters in diameter ) or purpura ( 2 millimeters to 1 centimeter in diameter ) . Ecchymoses also have a more diffuse border than other purpura .   Cause   There are many causes of subcutaneous hematomas including ecchymoses . Coagulopathies such as Hemophilia A may cause ecchymosis formation in children .   Etymology and pronunciation   The word ecchymosis ( ; plural ecchymoses , ) comes to English from New Latin , based on Greek ekchymōsis , from ekchymousthai `` to extravasate blood '' , from ex- ( elided to e- ) and chymos , `` juice '' .

The term was popularized by Plato 's Socratic dialogues but the act itself has been central to European and Indian philosophy since ancient history .   The term dialectic is not synonymous with the term debate . While in theory debaters are not necessarily emotionally invested in their point of view , in practice debaters frequently display an emotional commitment that may cloud rational judgment . Debates are won through a combination of persuading the opponent , proving one 's argument correct , or proving the opponent 's argument incorrect . Debates do not necessarily require promptly identifying a clear winner or loser ; however clear winners are frequently determined by either a judge , jury , or by group consensus . The term dialectics is also not synonymous with the term rhetoric , a method or art of discourse that seeks to persuade , inform , or motivate an audience . Concepts , like `` logos '' or rational appeal , `` pathos '' or emotional appeal , and `` ethos '' or ethical appeal , are intentionally used by rhetoricians to persuade an audience .   The Sophists taught aretē ( , quality , excellence ) as the highest value , and the determinant of one 's actions in life . The Sophists taught artistic quality in oratory ( motivation via speech ) as a manner of demonstrating one 's aretē . Oratory was taught as an art form , used to please and to influence other people via excellent speech ; nonetheless , the Sophists taught the pupil to seek aretē in all endeavours , not solely in oratory .   Socrates favoured truth as the highest value , proposing that it could be discovered through reason and logic in discussion : ergo , dialectic . Socrates valued rationality ( appealing to logic , not emotion ) as the proper means for persuasion , the discovery of truth , and the determinant for one 's actions . To Socrates , truth , not aretē , was the greater good , and each person should , above all else , seek truth to guide one 's life . Therefore , Socrates opposed the Sophists and their teaching of rhetoric as art and as emotional oratory requiring neither logic nor proof . Different forms of dialectical reasoning have emerged throughout history from the Indosphere ( Greater India ) and the West ( Europe ) . These forms include the Socratic method , Hindu , Buddhist , Medieval , Hegelian dialectics , Marxist , Talmudic , and Neo-orthodoxy .   Principles   The purpose of the dialectic method of reasoning is resolution of disagreement through rational discussion , and , ultimately , the search for truth . One way to proceed—the Socratic method—is to show that a given hypothesis ( with other admissions ) leads to a contradiction ; thus , forcing the withdrawal of the hypothesis as a candidate for truth ( see reductio ad absurdum ) . Another dialectical resolution of disagreement is by denying a presupposition of the contending thesis and antithesis ; thereby , proceeding to sublation ( transcendence ) to synthesis , a third thesis .   Fichtean /Hegelian dialectics is based upon four concepts :  # Everything is transient and finite , existing in the medium of time .  # Everything is composed of contradictions ( opposing forces ) .  # Gradual changes lead to crises , turning points when one force overcomes its opponent force ( quantitative change leads to qualitative change ) .  # Change is helical ( spiral ) , not circular ( negation of the negation ) .   The concept of dialectic ( as a unity of opposites ) existed in the philosophy of Heraclitus of Ephesus , who proposed that everything is in constant change , as a result of inner strife and opposition . Hence , the history of the dialectical method is the history of philosophy.Cassin , Barbara ( ed . ) , Vocabulaire européen des philosophies [ Paris : Le Robert & Seuil , 2004 ] , p. 306 , trans . M.K . Jensen   Western dialectical forms   Classical philosophy   According to Kant , the ancient Greeks used the word `` dialectic '' to signify the logic of false appearance or semblance . To the Ancients , `` it was nothing but the logic of illusion . It was a sophistic art of giving to one 's"], [329, "For music from a year in the 1950s , go to 50 | 51 | 52 | 53 | 54 | 55 | 56 | 57 | 58 | 59   This article includes an overview of the major events and trends in popular music in the 1950s .   In the First World , rock and roll , doo-wop , pop , swing , rhythm and blues , blues , country and rockabilly dominated and defined the decade 's music .   The U.S .   Rock and roll   Rock and roll dominated popular music in the later half of the 1950s . The musical style originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s , and quickly spread to much of the rest of the world . Its immediate origins lay in a mixing together of various black musical genres of the time , including rhythm and blues and gospel music ; with country and western and Pop . In 1951 , Cleveland , Ohio disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music for a multi-racial audience , and is credited with first using the phrase `` rock and roll '' to describe the music .   The 1950s saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar ( developed and popularized by Les Paul ) . Paul 's hit records like `` How High the Moon '' , and `` The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise '' , helped lead to the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing of such exponents as Chuck Berry , Link Wray , and Scotty Moore . Chuck Berry , who is considered to be one of the pioneers of Rock and roll music , refined and developed the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive , focusing on teen life and introducing guitar solos and showmanship that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.M . Campbell , ed. , Popular Music in America : And the Beat Goes on ( Cengage Learning , 3rd edn. , 2008 ) , pp . 168-9 .   Artists such as Chuck Berry , Bo Diddley , Fats Domino , Little Richard , Jerry Lee Lewis , Big Joe Turner , and Gene Vincent released the initial rhythm and blues-influenced early rock and roll hits . Rock and roll forerunners in the popular music field included Johnnie Ray , The Crew-Cuts , The Fontane Sisters , and Les Paul and Mary Ford . The Rock and Roll Era is generally dated from 25 March 1955 premiere of the motion picture , `` The Blackboard Jungle '' . This film ’ s use of Bill Haley and His Comets ' `` ( We ’ re Gon na ) Rock Around the Clock '' over its opening credits , caused a national sensation when teenagers started dancing in the aisles .   Pat Boone became one of the most successful artists of the 50s with his heavily Pop-influenced `` covers '' of R & B hits like `` Two Hearts , Two Kisses ( Make One Love ) '' , `` Ai n't That a Shame '' , and `` At My Front Door ( Crazy Little Mama ) '' . Boone 's traditional pop approach to rock and roll , coupled with his All-American , clean-cut image helped bring the new sound to a much wider audience . Elvis Presley , who began his career in the mid-1950s , soon became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll with a series of network television appearances , motion pictures , and chart-topping records . His energized interpretations of songs , many from African American sources , and his uninhibited performance style made him enormously popular—and controversial during that period . Boone and Presley 's styles/images represented opposite ends of the burgeoning musical form , which competed with one another throughout the remainder of the decade .   In 1957 , a popular television show featuring rock and roll performers , American Bandstand , went national . Hosted by Dick Clark , the program helped to popularize the more clean-cut , All-American brand of rock and roll . By the end of the decade , teen idols like Bobby Darin , Ricky Nelson , Frankie Avalon , Paul Anka , Neil Sedaka , Bobby Rydell , Connie Francis , and Fabian Forte were topping the charts . Some commentators have perceived this as the decline of rock and roll ; citing the deaths of Buddy Holly , The Big Bopper and Richie Valens in a tragic plane crash in 1959 and the departure of Elvis for the army"], [330, "Lily Munster , Countess of Shroudshire ( née Dracula ) , is a fictional character in the CBS sitcom , The Munsters , originally played by Yvonne De Carlo . The matriarch of the Munster household , Lily is a vampire . The role was later played by Lee Meriwether in The Munsters Today and by Portia de Rossi in Mockingbird Lane .   In the original unaired color pilot her name was Phoebe Munster .   Origins   Lily was born in 1827 to Sam Dracula ( Grandpa ) and his 166th wife ( referred to only as `` Grandma '' ) . She lived with Grandpa for some time in Transylvania ( a region in Romania ) before meeting Herman Munster and marrying him in 1865 . She , Grandpa , and Herman moved to America sometime before the mid-1940s and adopted her sister 's child , Marilyn . In the mid-1950s , she gave birth to Eddie , her and Herman 's only child .   Her name is presumably derived from the tradition of the lily as a flower of death , or a vague reference to Lilith , a female demon of Jewish mythology .   Description   Lily is the matriarch of the Munster family . She is very close with her niece , Marilyn . She has a werewolf for a brother , who appears in one episode , and a sister who is mentioned a few times who is Marilyn 's mother . Lily is the voice of reason in the Munster household , often relied upon to set problems right , and typically mediates when Herman and Grandpa squabble .   Lily also has a fiery temper . While she is deeply in love with Herman ( `` Pussycat , '' as she calls him ) , she also frequently gets very angry at him ( due to his frequent stupidity and occasional selfishness ) , and Herman often meekly discloses his fear ( to others ) of being on the receiving end of her wrath . She also has reprimanded her own father ( Grandpa ) on several occasions for his own foolish actions and stubborn self-righteousness .   Lily treats her niece Marilyn as her own daughter , but shares the family 's concern that Marilyn 's `` hideousness '' is going to condemn her to a spinster 's life . As such , she is very much in favor of Marilyn dating , and is very accommodating to Marilyn 's fleeting beaus despite their `` rudeness . '' ( What Lily is perceiving as lack of manners is in fact the young man 's terror of seeing Marilyn 's monstrous relatives ) .   Lily is very supportive of her son , Eddie , and keeps a close eye on his activities and social circle .   Lily is mainly a housewife , and her duties include spreading garbage around the mansion and `` dusting '' with a vacuum cleaner operating in reverse so that it blows dirt about in the nine-room-and-a-dungeon house . During the course of the series , Lily works as a welder in a shipyard , a fashion model , and a palm reader in a tea room . In one episode she forces Herman to give her money so that she and Marilyn can open a beauty parlor , but this soon goes out of business , as Lily assumes her clientele wants to look more like her . These part-time jobs never seem to stick , and Lily would be back to being a homemaker by the next episode .   Lily is a beautiful and slender woman who appears to be in her middle age years , although she is actually hundreds of years old . Later incarnations of the character , played by different actresses , would change her skin from green to pale white . A white streak in her hair recalls the monster 's mate from Bride of Frankenstein . Lily usually dresses in an ankle-length pale pink gown that appears faded and old , and she sometimes also wears a scarf . Her necklace features a bat-shaped medallion . When away from the Munster house , she sometimes wears a long silver cape with a hood . In the episode `` Munsters Masquerade '' , Lily demonstrates the ability to float in the air while dancing .   True to her vampire nature , when Lily sleeps she resembles a corpse : ramrod straight and fingers cradled on her chest , even holding a lily ( flower ) between her fingers . However , like her father , she casts a reflection , sleeps at"], [331, "The Big Breakfast was a British light entertainment television show shown on Channel 4 and S4C each weekday morning from 28 September 1992 until 29 March 2002 during which period 2,482 shows were produced . The Big Breakfast was produced by Planet 24 , the production company co-owned by former Boomtown Rats singer and Live Aid organiser Bob Geldof .   The programme was distinctive for broadcasting live from a former lockkeepers ' cottages commonly referred to as `` The Big Breakfast House '' , or more simply , `` The House '' , located on Fish Island , in Bow in east London .   The show was a mix of news , weather , interviews , audience phone-ins and general features , with a light tone which was in competition with the more serious GMTV and even more serious BBC Breakfast programmes .   History   The Big Breakfast was launched at the end of September 1992 to replace The Channel Four Daily , which was Channel 4 's unsuccessful first dip into the breakfast television market between 1989 and 1992 . The Daily , launched at huge expense , had possessed an analytical style , focusing largely on current affairs , news bulletins and cerebral quiz shows ; however , this format had failed to earn enough viewing figures , and consequently Channel 4 opted to change direction and work towards a lighter style concentrating mainly on entertainment and humour .   The first two presenters were Chris Evans ( from 1992 to 1994 ) and Gaby Roslin ( 1992 to 1996 ) . At its height in 1993 , viewing figures reached around two million per edition , and it was the highest rated UK breakfast television programme . Along with Evans and Roslin , Bob Geldof presented a short-lived political interview slot . His wife Paula Yates became notorious with her interviews conducted lying on a bed , and the puppet characters Zig and Zag created morning mayhem in the bathroom with Evans in a slot called 'The Crunch ' .   As part of his contract with The Big Breakfast , Evans was committed to developing a new show for Channel 4 . Do n't Forget Your Toothbrush began in early 1994 , and Evans cut his involvement with The Big Breakfast to three days a week , Tuesday to Thursday . Former Neighbours star Mark Little replaced Evans on Mondays and Fridays . When Evans left the show later that year , Little continued on Thursdays and Fridays while Paul Ross took over Mondays to Wednesdays . Richard Orford replaced Ross around Easter 1995 but was quickly dropped and exchanged with Down Your Doorstep presenter Keith Chegwin . In July 1995 , the show reverted to using just one male presenter throughout the week , Mark Little . Chegwin would cover for Little when he was on tour as a comedian or on holiday .   Relaunch   Roslin continued full-time until she made way for Zoë Ball in 1996 . Audience figures slipped a little after Evans left , and a little more after Roslin stopped appearing . Mark Little left the programme in July 1996 , following press reports that he and Zoë Ball had fallen out . Little was replaced by Keith Chegwin , who himself exited the programme in August 1996 , just ahead of a massive relaunch . In an attempt to stem the sliding viewing figures , the Big Breakfast house was refurbished at a cost of £2 million . New presenters Rick Adams and Sharron Davies were brought in but viewing figures fell dramatically . Davies left the programme in early 1997 , to be replaced by Denise van Outen . Van Outen had initially been brought in as part of the September 1996 relaunch as a traffic and travel presenter , before being given a role based at the house as the phone room presenter and holiday relief for Davies . In June 1997 , Johnny Vaughan covered for Adams for a fortnight alongside Van Outen , the pair forging a successful on screen partnership . Adams left the programme shortly afterwards and , in September 1997 , the Vaughan and Van Outen partnership was made permanent . Audience figures stabilised and the duo fronted the programme together until Van Outen 's departure on January 1 , 1999 . ( A New Year 's Day pre-record ) . Kelly Brook was installed as Vaughan 's new co-presenter despite an internet campaign for the role to be awarded to Liza Tarbuck , an old friend of Vaughan 's who had successfully covered for Van Outen in the summer of 1998 . However , Brook struggled in the role"], [332, "The aurochs ( or ; pl . aurochs , or rarely aurochsen , aurochses ) , also urus , ure ( Bos primigenius ) , is an extinct type of large wild cattle that inhabited Europe , Asia and North Africa . It is the ancestor of domestic cattle . The species survived in Europe until the last recorded aurochs died in the Jaktorów Forest , Poland in 1627 .   During the Neolithic Revolution , which occurred during the early Holocene , there were at least two aurochs domestication events : one related to the Indian subspecies , leading to zebu cattle ; the other one related to the Eurasian subspecies , leading to taurine cattle . Other species of wild bovines were also domesticated , namely the wild water buffalo , gaur , and banteng . In modern cattle , numerous breeds share characteristics of the aurochs , such as a dark colour in the bulls with a light eel stripe along the back ( the cows being lighter ) , or a typical aurochs-like horn shape .   Taxonomy   The aurochs was variously classified as Bos primigenius , Bos taurus , or , in old sources , Bos urus . However , in 2003 , the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature `` conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species , which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms '' , confirming Bos primigenius for the aurochs . Taxonomists who consider domesticated cattle a subspecies of the wild aurochs should use B. primigenius taurus ; those who consider domesticated cattle to be a separate species may use the name B. taurus , which the Commission has kept available for that purpose .   Etymology   The words aurochs , urus , and wisent have all been used synonymously in English . However , the extinct aurochs/urus is a completely separate species from the still-extant wisent , also known as European bison . The two were often confused , and some 16th-century illustrations of aurochs and wisents have hybrid features .  The word urus ( ; plural uri ) is a Latin word , but was borrowed into Latin from Germanic ( cf . Old English/Old High German ūr , Old Norse úr ) . In German , OHG ūr was compounded with ohso `` ox '' , giving ūrohso , which became early modern Aurochs . The modern form is Auerochse .   The word aurochs was borrowed from early modern German , replacing archaic urochs , also from an earlier form of German . The word is invariable in number in English , though sometimes back-formed singular auroch and innovated plural aurochses occur . The use in English of the plural form ' is nonstandard , but mentioned in The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language . It is directly parallel to the German plural Ochsen ( singular Ochse ) and recreates by analogy the same distinction as English ox ( singular ) and oxen ( plural ) .   Evolution     During the Pliocene , the colder climate caused an extension of open grassland , which led to the evolution of large grazers , such as wild bovines . Bos acutifrons is an extinct species of cattle that has been suggested as an ancestor for the aurochs .   The oldest aurochs remains have been dated to about 2 million years ago , in India . The Indian subspecies was the first to appear . During the Pleistocene , the species migrated west into the Middle East ( western Asia ) as well as to the east . They reached Europe about 270,000 years ago . The South Asian domestic cattle , or zebu , descended from Indian aurochs at the edge of the Thar Desert ; the zebu is resistant to drought . Domestic yak , gayal and banteng do not descend from aurochs .   The first complete mitochondrial genome ( 16,338 base pairs ) DNA sequence analysis of `` Bos primigenius '' from an archaeologically verified and exceptionally well preserved aurochs bone sample was published in 2010 .   Three wild subspecies of aurochs are recognized . Only the Eurasian subspecies survived until recent times .  * The Eurasian aurochs ( Bos primigenius primigenius ) once ranged across the steppes and taigas of Europe , Siberia , and Central Asia , and East Asia . It is noted as part of the Pleistocene megafauna , and declined in numbers along with other megafauna species by the end of Pleistocene . The Eurasian aurochs were domesticated into modern taurine cattle breeds around the 6th millennium BC in the Middle East"], [333, "Gordon Banks , OBE ( born 30 December 1937 ) is a former England international football goalkeeper . He made 628 appearances during a 15-year career in the Football League , and won 73 caps for his country . Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time , the IFFHS named Banks the second best goalkeeper of the 20th century – after Lev Yashin ( 1st ) and ahead of Dino Zoff ( 3rd ) . He was named FWA Footballer of the Year in 1972 , and was named FIFA Goalkeeper of the Year on six occasions .   He joined Chesterfield in March 1953 , and played for the youth team in the 1956 FA Youth Cup final . He made his first team debut in November 1958 , and was sold to Leicester City for £7,000 in July 1959 . He played in four cup finals for the club , as they were beaten in the 1961 and 1963 FA Cup finals , before winning the League Cup in 1964 and finishing as finalists in 1965 . During this time he established himself as England 's number one goalkeeper , and played every game of the nation 's 1966 World Cup victory . Despite this success , he was dropped by Leicester and sold on to Stoke City for £50,000 in April 1967 . He made one of the game 's great saves to prevent a Pelé goal in the 1970 World Cup , but was absent due to illness as England were beaten by West Germany at the quarter-final stage .   He was Stoke 's goalkeeper in the 1972 League Cup win – the club 's only major honour . He was still Stoke and England 's number one when a car crash in October 1972 cost him both the sight in one eye and his professional career . He did though play in the United States for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in 1977 and 1978 . He briefly entered management with Telford United , but left the game after he was sacked in December 1980 .   Club career   Chesterfield   Banks was born in Sheffield , West Riding of Yorkshire , and brought up in the working class area of Tinsley . The family later moved to the village of Catcliffe after his father set up a ( then illegal ) betting shop . This brought greater prosperity but also misery , as one day Banks 's disabled brother was mugged for the shop 's daily takings , and died of his injuries some weeks later . He left school in December 1952 , and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant , which helped to build up his upper body strength . He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C . after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match ; the club 's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys . His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare , however a 12–2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3–1 home defeat , and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh . Still aged 15 , he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier .   He was scouted by Chesterfield whilst playing for Millspaugh , and offered a six-game trial in the youth team in March 1953 . He impressed enough in these games to be offered a part-time £3 a week contract by manager Teddy Davison in July 1953 . The reserve team were placed in the Central League on account of a powerful club director rather than on merit , and Banks conceded 122 goals in the 1954–55 season as the `` Spireites '' finished in last place with only three victories . Banks was posted to Germany with the Royal Signals on national service , and won the Rhine Cup with his regimental team . He recovered from a fractured elbow to help the Chesterfield youth team to the 1956 final of the FA Youth Cup . There they were beaten 4–3 on aggregate by Manchester United 's famous `` Busby Babes '' – a team that included both Wilf McGuinness and Bobby Charlton .   Banks was given his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone , at the expense of long-serving Ron Powell , in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958 . The game ended 2–2 , and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the following match"], [334, 'The bluebottle fly or bottlebee ( Calliphora vomitoria ) is a common blow fly found in most areas of the world and is the type species for the genus Calliphora . Its larva , used as fishing bait , is called a maggot , while its pupa , also widely used for bait , is called a caster . Similar species include the greenbottle fly , a close relative that can be distinguished by its bright green metallic colouring . Bluebottle fly adults feed on nectar , while the larvae feed on carcasses of dead animals . Adults are also pollinators to some flowers with strong odor .   Description   It is 10 - long , slightly larger than a housefly . The head and thorax are dull gray and the abdomen is bright metallic blue with black markings . Its body and legs are covered with black bristle-like hair . It has short , clubbed antennae and 4 tarsi per leg . The eyes are red and the wings are transparent . The legs and antennae are black and pink . The chest is bright purple and has spikes to protect themselves against other flies . These insects like to fly in packs in order to detect possible prey more efficiently . If one fly detects food , it will disperse a pheromone which will alert the others to the meal .   Life cycle   A female blue bottle fly lays her eggs where she feeds , usually in decaying meat , garbage , or feces . Pale whitish larvae , commonly called maggots , soon hatch from the eggs and immediately begin feeding on the decomposing matter where they were hatched . After a few days of feeding , they are fully grown . At that time they will crawl away to a dry place where they can burrow into soil or similar matter to pupate into tough brown cocoons . After two or three weeks , the adults emerge to mate , beginning the cycle again . During cold weather , pupae and adults can hibernate until higher temperatures revive them .   They are pollinators of some flowers with a strong odor such as skunk cabbage and goldenrod .

The island is located in the archipelago of the Society Islands in the central Southern Pacific Ocean , and is divided into two parts : The bigger , northwestern part Tahiti Nui and the smaller , southeastern part Tahiti Iti . The island was formed from volcanic activity and is high and mountainous with surrounding coral reefs . The population is 183,645 inhabitants ( 2012 census ) , making it the most populous island of French Polynesia and accounting for 68.5 % of its total population .   Tahiti is the economic , cultural and political centre of French Polynesia . The capital of the collectivity , Pape'ete , is located on the northwest coast with the only international airport in the region , Fa ' a ' ā International Airport , situated 5 km from the town centre .   Tahiti was originally settled by Polynesians between 300 and 800 CE . They represent about 70 % of the island 's population with the rest made up of Europeans , Chinese and those of mixed heritage .   The island was part of the Kingdom of Tahiti until its annexation by France in 1880 , when it was proclaimed a colony of France . It was not until 1946 that the indigenous Tahitians were legally authorised to be French citizens . French is the only official language although the Tahitian language ( Reo Tahiti ) is widely spoken .   Geography   Tahiti is the highest and largest island in French Polynesia lying close to Moorea island . It is located 4400 km south of Hawaii , 7900 km from Chile and 5700 km from Australia .   The island is 45 km across at its widest point and covers an area of 1045 km2 . The highest peak is Mont Orohena ( Mou ' a 'Orohena ) ( 2241 m ) . Mount Roonui , or Mount Ronui ( Mou ' a Rōnui ) in the southeast rises to 1332 m. The island consists of two roughly round portions centred on volcanic mountains and connected by a short isthmus named after the small town of Taravao , situated there .   The northwestern portion is known as Tahiti Nui ( `` big Tahiti '' ) , while the much smaller southeastern portion is known as Tahiti Iti ( `` small Tahiti '' ) or Tai'arapū . Tahiti Nui is heavily populated along the coast , especially around the capital , Papeete .   The interior of Tahiti Nui is almost entirely uninhabited . Tahiti Iti has remained isolated , as its southeastern half ( Te Pari ) is accessible only to those travelling by boat or on foot . The rest of the island is encircled by a main road which cuts between the mountains and the sea .   A scenic and winding interior road climbs past dairy farms and citrus groves with panoramic views . Tahiti 's landscape features lush rainforests and many streams , including the Papenoo River on the north side .   Climate   November to April is the wet season , the wettest month of which is January with of rain in Papeetē . August is the driest with .   The average temperature ranges between 21 and with little seasonal variation . The lowest and highest temperatures recorded in Papeete are 16 and , respectively .   History   Prehistoric colonization of Tahiti   The first Tahitians arrived from Southeast Asia in about 200 BCE , after a long migration from South East Asia or Indonesia , via the Fijian , Samoan and Tongan Archipelagos . This hypothesis of an emigration from Southeast Asia is supported by a number of linguistic , biological and archaeological proofs . For example , the languages of Fiji and Polynesia all belong to the same Oceanic sub-group , Fijian-Polynesian , which itself forms part of the great family of the Austronesian Languages .   This emigration , across several hundred kilometres of ocean , was made possible by using outrigger canoes that were up to twenty or thirty meters long and could transport families as well as domestic animals . In 1769 , for instance , James Cook mentions a great traditional ship ( va ' a ) in Tahiti that was 33 m long , and could be propelled by sail or paddles .  In 2010 , an expedition on a simple outrigger canoe with a sail retraced the route back from Tahiti to Asia"], [336, "Robert Devereux , 2nd Earl of Essex , KG PC ( ; 10 November 1565 – 25 February 1601 ) was an English nobleman and a favourite of Elizabeth I . Politically ambitious , and a committed general , he was placed under house arrest following a poor campaign in Ireland during the Nine Years ' War in 1599 . In 1601 , he led an abortive coup d'état against the government and was executed for treason . He is an ancestor of Queen Elizabeth II .   Early life   Essex was born on 10 November 1565 at Netherwood near Bromyard , in Herefordshire , the son of Walter Devereux , 1st Earl of Essex , and Lettice Knollys . His maternal great-grandmother Mary Boleyn was a sister of Anne Boleyn , the mother of Queen Elizabeth I , making him a first-cousin-twice-removed of the Queen .   He was brought up on his father 's estates at Chartley Castle , Staffordshire , and at Lamphey , Pembrokeshire , in Wales . His father died in 1576 , and the new Earl of Essex became a ward of Lord Burghley . In 1577 , he was admitted as a fellow-commoner at Trinity College , Cambridge ; in 1579 , he matriculated ; and in 1581 he graduated as Master of Arts .   On 21 September 1578 , Essex 's mother married Robert Dudley , Earl of Leicester , Elizabeth I 's long-standing favourite and Robert Devereux 's godfather .   Essex performed military service under his stepfather in the Netherlands , before making an impact at court and winning the Queen 's favour . In 1590 , he married Frances Walsingham , daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham and widow of Sir Philip Sidney , by whom he was to have several children , three of whom survived into adulthood . Sidney , Leicester 's nephew , died in 1586 at the Battle of Zutphen in which Essex also distinguished himself . In October 1591 , Devereux 's mistress , Elizabeth Southwell , gave birth to a son who survived into adulthood .   Court and military career   Essex first came to court in 1584 , and by 1587 had become a favourite of the Queen , who relished his lively mind and eloquence , as well as his skills as a showman and in courtly love . In June 1587 he replaced the Earl of Leicester as Master of the Horse . After Leicester 's death in 1588 , the Queen transferred the late Earl 's royal monopoly on sweet wines to Essex , providing him with revenue from taxes . In 1593 , he was made a member of her Privy Council .   Essex underestimated the Queen , however , and his later behaviour towards her lacked due respect and showed disdain for the influence of her principal secretary , Robert Cecil . On one occasion during a heated Privy Council debate on the problems in Ireland , the Queen reportedly cuffed an insolent Essex round the ear , prompting him to half draw his sword on her .   In 1589 , he took part in Francis Drake 's English Armada , which sailed to Spain in an unsuccessful attempt to press home the English advantage following the defeat of the Spanish Armada , although the Queen had ordered him not to take part in the expedition . In 1591 , he was given command of a force sent to the assistance of King Henry IV of France . In 1596 , he distinguished himself by the capture of Cadiz . During the Islands Voyage expedition to the Azores in 1597 , with Walter Raleigh as his second in command , he defied the Queen 's orders , pursuing the treasure fleet without first defeating the Spanish battle fleet .   When the Spanish fleet appeared off the English coast during the 3rd Spanish Armada in the Autumn of 1597 panic then ensued because the English fleet had been far out to sea with the coast virtually undefended . This further depleted the relationship between the Queen and Essex even though initially he was put in charge of the fleet to face the Spanish threat .   Ireland   Essex 's greatest failure was as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland , a post which he talked himself into in 1599 . The Nine Years War ( 1595–1603 ) was in its middle stages , and no English commander had been successful . More military force was required to defeat the Irish chieftains , led by Hugh O'Neill , the Earl of Tyrone and supplied from Spain and Scotland .

In Euclidean geometry any three points , when non-collinear , determine a unique triangle and a unique plane ( i.e . a two-dimensional Euclidean space ) . This article is about triangles in Euclidean geometry except where otherwise noted .   Types of triangle   By lengths of sides   Triangles can be classified according to the lengths of their sides :  * An equilateral triangle has all sides the same length . An equilateral triangle is also a regular polygon with all angles measuring 60° .  * An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length.Euclid defines isosceles triangles based on the number of equal sides , i.e . only two equal sides . An alternative approach defines isosceles triangles based on shared properties , i.e . equilateral triangles are a special case of isosceles triangles . An isosceles triangle also has two angles of the same measure ; namely , the angles opposite to the two sides of the same length ; this fact is the content of the isosceles triangle theorem , which was known by Euclid . Some mathematicians define an isosceles triangle to have exactly two equal sides , whereas others define an isosceles triangle as one with at least two equal sides . The latter definition would make all equilateral triangles isosceles triangles . The 45–45–90 right triangle , which appears in the tetrakis square tiling , is isosceles .  * A scalene triangle has all its sides of different lengths . Equivalently , it has all angles of different measure . A right triangle is also a scalene triangle if and only if it is not isosceles .   Hatch marks , also called tick marks , are used in diagrams of triangles and other geometric figures to identify sides of equal lengths . A side can be marked with a pattern of `` ticks '' , short line segments in the form of tally marks ; two sides have equal lengths if they are both marked with the same pattern . In a triangle , the pattern is usually no more than 3 ticks . An equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 sides , an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 sides , and a scalene triangle has different patterns on all sides since no sides are equal . Similarly , patterns of 1 , 2 , or 3 concentric arcs inside the angles are used to indicate equal angles . An equilateral triangle has the same pattern on all 3 angles , an isosceles triangle has the same pattern on just 2 angles , and a scalene triangle has different patterns on all angles since no angles are equal .   By internal angles   Triangles can also be classified according to their internal angles , measured here in degrees .  * A right triangle ( or right-angled triangle , formerly called a rectangled triangle ) has one of its interior angles measuring 90° ( a right angle ) . The side opposite to the right angle is the hypotenuse , the longest side of the triangle . The other two sides are called the legs or catheti ( singular : cathetus ) of the triangle . Right triangles obey the Pythagorean theorem : the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse : , where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse . Special right triangles are right triangles with additional properties that make calculations involving them easier . One of the two most famous is the 3–4–5 right triangle , where . In this situation , 3 , 4 , and 5 are a Pythagorean triple . The other one is an isosceles triangle that has 2 angles that each measure 45 degrees .  * Triangles that do not have an angle measuring 90° are called oblique triangles .  * A triangle with all interior angles measuring less than 90° is an acute triangle or acute-angled triangle . If c is the length of the longest side , then , where a and b are the lengths of the other sides .  * A triangle with one interior angle measuring more than 90° is an obtuse triangle or obtuse-angled triangle . If c is the length of the longest side , then , where a and b"], [338, "The Moselle ( , ; ; ) is a river flowing through France , Luxembourg , and Germany . It is a left tributary of the Rhine , which it joins at Koblenz . A small part of Belgium is also drained by the Moselle through the Sauer and the Our .   The Moselle `` twists and turns its way between Trier and Koblenz along one of Germany 's most beautiful river valleys . `` [ http : //www.romantic-germany.info/Moselle.4106.0.html Moselle : Holidays in one of Germany 's most beautiful river valleys ] at www.romantic-germany.info . Retrieved 23 Jan 2016 . It flows through a region that has been influenced by mankind since it was first cultivated by the Romans . Today , its hillsides are covered by terraced vineyards where `` some of the best Rieslings grow '' , and numerous ruined castles dominate the hilltops above wine villages and towns that line the riverbanks . Traben-Trarbach with its art nouveau architecture and Bernkastel-Kues with its traditional market square are two of the many popular tourist attractions on the Moselle river .   Name   The name Moselle is derived from the Celtic name form , Moseal , via the Latin Mosella , a diminutive form of Mosa , the Latin description of the Meuse , which used to flow parallel to the Moselle . So the Mosella was the `` Little Meuse '' .   The Moselle is first recorded by Tacitus in Book 13 of his Annals and in Book 4 of his Histories .   The Roman poet , Decimius Magnus Ausonius , made it a literary theme as early as the 4th century . In his poem dated A.D. 371 , called Mosella , which was published in 483 hexameters , this poet of the Late Antiquity and teacher at the Trier Imperial Court ( Kaiserhof ) described a journey from Bingen over the Hunsrück hills to the Moselle and then following its course to Trier on the road named after him , the Via Ausonius . Ausonius describes flourishing and rich landscapes along the river and in the valley of the Moselle , thanks to the policies of their Roman rulers .   The river subsequently gave its name to two French republican départements : Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle .   Geography   The source of the Moselle is at 715 metres above sea level on the Col de Bussang on the western slopes of the Ballon d'Alsace in the Vosges . After 544 kilometres it discharges into the Rhine at the Deutsches Eck in Koblenz at a height of 59 metres above NHN . The length of the river in France is 314 kilometres , for 39 kilometres it forms the border between Germany and Luxembourg , and 208 kilometres are solely within Germany .   The Moselle flows through the Lorraine region , west of the Vosges . Further downstream , in Germany , the Moselle valley forms the division between the Eifel and Hunsrück mountain regions .   The average flow rate of the Moselle at its mouth is 328 m³/s , Hydrologischer Atlas der Schweiz 2002 , Tab . 5.4 Natürliche Abflüsse 1961-1980 ( natural discharges ) ( [ http : //www.hydrologie.unibe.ch/hades/hades/tafel_54.html see map ] ) making it the second largest tributary of the Rhine by volume after the Aare ( 560 m³/s ) and bigger than the Main and Neckar .   River sections   The section of the Moselle from the Franco-German-Luxembourg tripoint to its confluence with the Saar near Konz shortly before Trier is in Germany known ( geographically incorrectly ) as the Upper Moselle . The section from Trier to Pünderich is the Middle Moselle , the section between Pünderich and its mouth in Koblenz as the Lower Moselle or Terraced Moselle ( Terrassenmosel ) . Characteristic of the Middle and Lower Moselle are its wide meanders cut deeply into the highlands of the Rhenish Massif , the most striking of which is the Cochemer Krampen between Bremm and Cochem . Also typical are its vineyard terraces .   From the tripoint the Moselle marks the entire Saarland-Luxembourg .   Catchment   The catchment area of the Moselle is 28,286 km² in area . The French part covers 15,360 km² , about 54 percent of the entire catchment . The German state of Rhineland-Palatinate has 6,980 km² , the Saarland 2,569 km² , Luxembourg 2,521 km² , Wallonia ( Belgium ) 767 km² and North Rhine-Westphalia , 88 km² .

( often referred to as Warner Bros. Pictures , Warner Bros. or just simply WB ) is an American entertainment company . As one of the major film studios , it is a division of Time Warner , with its headquarters in Burbank , California . Warner Bros. has several subsidiary companies , including Warner Bros. Pictures , Turner Entertainment Co. , Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment , Warner Bros. Television , Warner Bros . Animation , Warner Home Video , New Line Cinema , Castle Rock Entertainment , and DC Entertainment . Warner Bros. owns half of The CW Television Network .   History   Founding   The company 's name originates from the four founding Warner brothers ( born Wonskolaser or Wonsal before Anglicization ) : Harry , Albert , Sam , and Jack Warner . They emigrated as small children with their parents to Canada from Krasnosielc which was located in the part of Congress Poland that had been subjugated to the Russian Empire following the eighteenth-century Partitions of Poland near present-day Ostrołęka .   Jack , the youngest , was born in London , Ontario . The three elder brothers began in the movie theater business , having acquired a movie projector with which they showed films in the mining towns of Pennsylvania and Ohio . In the beginning , Sam and Albert Warner invested $ 150 to present Life of an American Fireman and The Great Train Robbery . They opened their first theater , the Cascade , in New Castle , Pennsylvania , in 1903 .   When the original building was in danger of being demolished , the modern Warner Bros. called the current building owners , and arranged to save it . The owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance .   In 1904 , the Warners founded the Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Amusement & Supply Company , to distribute films . In 1912 , Harry Warner hired an auditor named Paul Ashley Chase . By the time of World War I they had begun producing films . In 1918 they opened the first Warner Bros. studio on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood . Sam and Jack produced the pictures , while Harry and Albert , along with their auditor and now controller Chase , handled finance and distribution in New York City . During World War I their first nationally syndicated film , My Four Years in Germany , based on a popular book by former ambassador James W. Gerard , was released . On April 4 , 1923 , with help from money loaned to Harry by his banker Motley Flint , they formally incorporated as Warner Brothers Pictures , Incorporated . ( As late as the 1960s , Warner Bros. claimed 1905 as its founding date . )   The first important deal was the acquisition of the rights to Avery Hopwood 's 1919 Broadway play , The Gold Diggers , from theatrical impresario David Belasco . However , Rin Tin Tin , a dog brought from France after World War I by an American soldier , established their reputation . Rin Tin Tin debuted in the feature Where the North Begins . The movie was so successful that Jack signed the dog to star in more films for $ 1,000 per week . Rin Tin Tin became the studio 's top star . Jack nicknamed him `` The Mortgage Lifter '' and the success boosted Darryl F. Zanuck 's career . Zanuck eventually became a top producer and between 1928 and 1933 served as Jack 's right-hand man and executive producer , with responsibilities including day-to-day film production . More success came after Ernst Lubitsch was hired as head director ; Harry Rapf left the studio to join Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.Thomas46 , 47 Lubitsch 's film The Marriage Circle was the studio 's most successful film of 1924 , and was on The New York Times best list for that year .   Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and Lubitsch , Warner 's remained a lesser studio . Sam and Jack decided to offer Broadway actor John Barrymore the lead role in Beau Brummel . The film was so successful that Harry signed Barrymore to a long-term contract ; like The Marriage Circle , Beau Brummell was named one of the ten best films of the year by the Times . By the end of 1924 , Warner Bros. was arguably Hollywood 's most successful independent studio , where it competed with `` The Big Three '' Studios ( First National , Paramount Pictures , and MGM ) . As a result , Harry Warner—while speaking at a convention of 1,500"], [340, "A state of the United States of America is one of the 50 constituent political entities that shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government . Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government , Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside . State citizenship and residency are flexible , and no government approval is required to move between states , except for persons covered by certain types of court orders ( e.g. , paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody ) .   States range in population from just under 600,000 ( Wyoming ) to over 38 million ( California ) , and in area from ( Rhode Island ) to ( Alaska ) . Four states use the term commonwealth rather than state in their full official names .   States are divided into counties or county-equivalents , which may be assigned some local governmental authority but are not sovereign . County or county-equivalent structure varies widely by state . State governments are allocated power by the people ( of each respective state ) through their individual constitutions . All are grounded in republican principles , and each provides for a government , consisting of three branches : executive , legislative , and judicial .   States possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution ; among them ratifying constitutional amendments . Historically , the tasks of local law enforcement , public education , public health , regulating intrastate commerce , and local transportation and infrastructure have generally been considered primarily state responsibilities , although all of these now have significant federal funding and regulation as well . Over time , the U.S. Constitution has been amended , and the interpretation and application of its provisions have changed . The general tendency has been toward centralization and incorporation , with the federal government playing a much larger role than it once did . There is a continuing debate over states ' rights , which concerns the extent and nature of the states ' powers and sovereignty in relation to the federal government and the rights of individuals .   States and their residents are represented in the federal Congress , a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives . Each state is represented by two Senators , and at least one Representative , while additional representatives are distributed among the states in proportion to the most recent constitutionally mandated decennial census . Each state is also entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College , the body that elects the President of the United States , equal to the total of Representatives and Senators from that state .   The Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union . Since the establishment of the United States in 1776 , the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50 . Alaska and Hawaii are the most recent states admitted , both in 1959 .   The Constitution is silent on the question of whether states have the power to secede ( withdraw from ) from the Union . Shortly after the Civil War , the U.S. Supreme Court , in Texas v. White , held that a state can not unilaterally do so .   States of the United States   The 50 U.S. states ( in alphabetical order ) , along with state flag and date each joined the union :   Governments   As each state is itself a sovereign entity , it reserves the right to organize its individual government in any way ( within the broad parameters set by the U.S. Constitution ) deemed appropriate by its people . As a result , while the governments of the various states share many similar features , they often vary greatly with regard to form and substance . No two state governments are identical .   Constitutions   The government of each state is structured in accordance with its individual constitution . Many of these documents are more detailed and more elaborate than their federal counterpart . The Constitution of Alabama , for example , contains 310,296 words — more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution . In practice , each state has adopted a three-branch system of government , modeled after the federal government , and consisting of three branches ( although the three-branch structure is not required ) : executive , legislative , and judicial .   Executive   In each state , the chief executive is called the"], [341, "Blasphemy is the act of insulting or showing contempt or lack of reverence to a deity , to religious or holy persons or sacred things , or toward something considered sacred or inviolable .

Biography   Will was found in a trashcan when he was a baby , and taken to the Atlanta Children 's Home where he grew up . Despite the name , it was little more than a state orphanage . The woman who ran it and her assistants did the best they could , though they were understaffed and underpaid . The children were fed and clothed , the place was kept clean , some stability was provided . The state tried to place the children with foster families , which sometimes led to adoption into a loving environment , but more often than not that was n't the case . Will never gave up , carefully grooming himself every visiting day , so that someone would want to adopt him .

He uses all kinds of tricks to hide it : wearing a wristwatch to tell his left from right , using color-coded folders to identify his cases , using a digital recorder and voice recognition software to generate his reports , pretending that he forgot his glasses when someone hands him something to read . He shops for groceries based on familiar-looking labels or pictures on the packaging , and avoids new restaurants because he does n't have the menu memorized . He has trouble with the signs when driving in unfamiliar areas , and he can not read roadmaps . He hates changing technology—a new cell phone or stereo or television costs him hours laboriously reading the directions or programming the functions .

The Messiah is often referred to as `` King Messiah '' , or , in Hebrew , ( melekh mashiach ) , and , in Aramaic , malka meshiḥa .   Views   Historical   In Jewish eschatology the term mashiach , or `` Messiah '' , came to refer to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line , who is expected to be anointed with holy anointing oil and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age . The Messiah is often referred to as `` King Messiah '' , or , in Hebrew , ( melekh mashiach ) , and , in Aramaic , malka meshiḥa .   Orthodox views have generally held that the Messiah will be descended from his father through the line of King David , and will gather the Jews back into the Land of Israel , usher in an era of peace , build the Third Temple , father a male heir , re-institute the Sanhedrin , and so on . Jewish tradition alludes to two redeemers , both of whom are called mashiach and are involved in ushering in the Messianic age : Mashiach ben David ; and Mashiach ben Yosef . In general , the term Messiah unqualified refers to Mashiach ben David ( Messiah , son of David ) .   Talmud   The Talmud extensively discusses the coming of the Messiah ( Sanhedrin 98a–99a , et al . ) and describes a period of freedom and peace , which will be the time of ultimate goodness for the Jews .   Tractate Sanhedrin contains a long discussion of the events leading to the coming of the Messiah , for example :   The Talmud tells many stories about the Messiah , some of which represent famous Talmudic rabbis as receiving personal visitations from Elijah the Prophet and the Messiah . For example :   Views of Maimonides   The influental Jewish philosopher Maimonides discussed the messiah in his Mishneh Torah , his 14 volume compendium of Jewish law , in the section Hilkhot Melakhim Umilchamoteihem , chapters 11 & 12 .   According to Maimonides , Jesus of Nazareth is not the Messiah , as is claimed by Christians and Muslims .   Ancient Israel   Many of the scriptural requirements concerning the Messiah , what he will do , and what will be done during his reign are located in the Book of Isaiah , although requirements are mentioned by other prophets as well . Views on whether Hebrew Bible passages are Messianic may vary from and among scholars of ancient Israel looking at their meaning in original context and from and among rabbinical scholars .  * Isaiah 1:26 : `` And I will restore your judges as at first and your counsellors as in the beginning ; afterwards you shall be called City of Righteousness , Faithful City .

It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 . During most of its existence , the empire was the most powerful economic , cultural , and military force in Europe . Both `` Byzantine Empire '' and `` Eastern Roman Empire '' are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm ; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire ( , tr . ; ) , or Romania ( ) , and to themselves as `` Romans '' .   Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire 's Greek East and Latin West divided . Constantine I ( r. 324–337 ) reorganised the empire , made Constantinople the new capital , and legalised Christianity . Under Theodosius I ( r. 379–395 ) , Christianity became the Empire 's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed . Finally , under the reign of Heraclius ( r. 610–641 ) , the Empire 's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin . Thus , although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained , modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople , oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture , and characterised by Orthodox Christianity .   The borders of the Empire evolved significantly over its existence , as it went through several cycles of decline and recovery . During the reign of Justinian I ( r. 527–565 ) , the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast , including North Africa , Italy , and Rome itself , which it held for two more centuries . During the reign of Maurice ( r. 582–602 ) , the Empire 's eastern frontier was expanded and the north stabilised . However , his assassination caused the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628 , which exhausted the Empire 's resources and contributed to major territorial losses during the Muslim conquests of the seventh century . In a matter of years the Empire lost its richest provinces , Egypt and Syria , to the Arabs .   During the Macedonian dynasty ( 10th–11th centuries ) , the Empire again expanded and experienced the two-century long Macedonian Renaissance , which came to an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 . This battle opened the way for the Turks to settle in Anatolia as a homeland .   The Empire recovered again during the Komnenian restoration , such that by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city . However , it was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade , when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 and the territories that the Empire formerly governed were divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms . Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261 , the Byzantine Empire remained only one of several small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence . Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century . The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 finally ended the Byzantine Empire .   Nomenclature   The first use of the term `` Byzantine '' to label the later years of the Roman Empire was in 1557 , when the German historian Hieronymus Wolf published his work Corpus Historiæ Byzantinæ , a collection of historical sources . The term comes from `` Byzantium '' , the name of the city of Constantinople before it became Constantine 's capital . This older name of the city would rarely be used from this point onward except in historical or poetic contexts . The publication in 1648 of the Byzantine du Louvre ( Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae ) , and in 1680 of Du Cange 's Historia Byzantina further popularised the use of `` Byzantine '' among French authors , such as Montesquieu . However , it was not until the mid-19th century that the term came into general use in the Western world .   The Byzantine Empire was known to its inhabitants as the ``"], [345, "Joely Kim Richardson ( born 9 January 1965 ) is an English actress , known for her role as Julia McNamara in the FX drama series Nip/Tuck ( 2003–10 ) , and Queen Catherine Parr in the Showtime series The Tudors ( 2010 ) .

According to the Hebrew Bible , he was a former Egyptian prince who later in life became a religious leader and lawgiver , to whom the authorship of the Torah is traditionally attributed . Also called Moshe Rabbenu in Hebrew ( , lit . `` Moses our Teacher '' ) , he is the most important prophet in Judaism . He is also an important prophet in Christianity , Islam , Baha'ism as well as a number of other faiths .   According to the Book of Exodus , Moses was born in a time when his people , the Israelites , an enslaved minority , were increasing in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt 's enemies . Moses ' Hebrew mother , Jochebed , secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites . Through the Pharaoh 's daughter ( identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash ) , the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile river and grew up with the Egyptian royal family . After killing an Egyptian slavemaster ( because the slavemaster was smiting a Hebrew to death ) , Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian , where he encountered The Angel of the Lord , speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb ( which he regarded as the Mountain of God ) .   God sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery . Moses said that he could not speak with assurance or eloquence , so God allowed Aaron , his brother , to become his spokesperson . After the Ten Plagues , Moses led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea , after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai , where Moses received the Ten Commandments . After 40 years of wandering in the desert , Moses died within sight of the Promised Land .   According to archaeologist William G. Dever , scholarly consensus sees Moses as a legendary figure and not a historical person . Archaeological evidence does not support a mass-migration from Egypt , as described in the Bible . Rabbinical Judaism calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391–1271 ( 120 years ) BCE ; Jerome gives 1592 BCE , and James Ussher 1571 BCE as his birth year .   Name   The Biblical account of Moses ' birth provides him with a folk etymology to explain the ostensible meaning of his name . He is said to have received it from the Pharaoh 's daughter : `` he became her son . She named him Moses ( Moshe ) , saying , `` I drew him out ( meshitihu ) of the water .

This explanation links it to a verb mashah , meaning `` to draw out '' , which makes the Pharaoh 's daughter 's declaration a play on words . The princess made a grammatical mistake which is prophetic of his role in his future life , as someone who will `` draw the people of Israel out of Egypt through the waters of the Red Sea . ''   Several etymologies have been proposed . An Egyptian root msy , 'child of ' , has been considered as a possible etymology , arguably an abbreviation of a theophoric name , as for example in Egyptian names like Thutmoses ( Thoth created him ) and Ramesses ( Ra created him ) , Christopher B.

Life and career   Early life   Adams was born in Kingston , Ontario , Canada , to British parents , Elizabeth Jane ( née Watson ) and Captain Conrad J. Adams , who immigrated to Canada from Plymouth , England in the 1950s . Adams ' father , a Sandhurst officer in the British Army , joined the Canadian Army and later spent time as a United Nations peacekeeping observer for Canada , which led to him becoming a Canadian foreign service diplomat . Adams travelled with his parents to diplomatic postings in Portugal ( where he attended the American International School of Lisbon ) and Vienna , Austria , during the 1960s , and to Israel during the early 1970s . Adams has a brother , Bruce .   Early career   By 17 , Adams had started working in the Vancouver studio scene , working as a background vocalist for the CBC and backing local artists and with Motown keyboardist Robbie King , whom Adams attributes as having given him his first salaried session . Prior to that at age 15-16 he fronted various pub bands like Sweeney Todd that released `` If Wishes Were Horses '' and was often seen sitting in with other cover bands . He and his guitarist Keith Scott met during those club years and still work together today .   In 1978 , at 18 , Adams met Jim Vallance through a mutual friend in a Vancouver music store . Vallance was the former drummer and principal songwriter for Vancouver-based rock band Prism and had recently quit that band to focus on a career as a studio musician and songwriter . They agreed to meet at Vallance 's home studio a few days later , which proved to be the beginning of a partnership which still exists in 2016 . Later in 1978 , Adams signed to A & M records for one dollar . Some of the first demos written in 1978 have surfaced over the years , most notably `` I 'm Ready '' ( recorded for both the album Cuts Like a Knife and later his release for MTV Unplugged ) and `` Remember , '' which was recorded on his first album . Both songs were covered by other artists even before his first album"], [348, "Dr. Finlay is a fictional character , the hero of a series of stories by Scottish author A. J. Cronin .   History   The stories were used as the basis for the long-running BBC television programme Dr. Finlay 's Casebook , screened from 1962 to 1971 , and radio series of the same name ( 1970–78 ) . Based on Cronin 's novella entitled Country Doctor , the storylines centred on Dr. Finlay 's general medical practice in the fictional Scottish town of Tannochbrae during the late 1920s . The main characters were Dr. Finlay , a junior partner in the practice , played by Bill Simpson , Dr. Cameron , the craggy senior partner , played by Andrew Cruickshank , and Janet , their unflappable housekeeper and receptionist at Arden House , played by Barbara Mullen . Dr. Finlay returned to television with the ITV series , Doctor Finlay , continuing the stories into the late 1940s , which featured David Rintoul as Dr. Finlay , Ian Bannen as Dr. Cameron , and Annette Crosbie as Janet . It later aired in the U.S. on PBS ' Masterpiece Theatre .   Character   In the books , Dr Finlay worked alone . He was charming and became well-acquainted with his patients over many years . It was thus his trademark to know them from birth to death and so provide a continuous relationship ."], [349, "France ( French : ) , officially the French Republic ( ) , is a sovereign state comprising territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories . The European , or metropolitan , area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea , and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean . France spans 643801 km2 and has a total population of 66.7 million . It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris , the country 's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre . During the Iron Age , what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls , a Celtic people . The area was annexed in 51 BC by Rome , which held Gaul until 486 , when the Germanic Franks conquered the region and formed the Kingdom of France .   France emerged as a major European power in the Late Middle Ages , with its victory in the Hundred Years ' War ( 1337 to 1453 ) strengthening state-building and political centralization . During the Renaissance , French culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established , which by the 20th century would be the second largest in the world . The 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Protestants ( Huguenots ) . France became Europe 's dominant cultural , political , and military power under Louis XIV . In the late 18th century , the French Revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy , established one of modern history 's earliest republics , and saw the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , which expresses the nation 's ideals to this day .   In the 19th century Napoleon took power and established the First French Empire , whose subsequent Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of continental Europe . Following the collapse of the Empire , France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the French Third Republic in 1870 . France was a major participant in the First World War , from which it emerged victorious , and was one of the Allied Powers in the Second World War , but came under occupation by the Axis Powers in 1940 . Following liberation in 1944 , a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War . The Fifth Republic , led by Charles de Gaulle , was formed in 1958 and remains to this day . Algeria and the colonies in Indochina became independent in the 1950s after long , bloody wars . Nearly all the other colonies became independent in the 1960s with minimal controversy and typically retained close economic and military connections with France .   France has long been a global center of art , science , and philosophy . It hosts Europe 's third-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites ( after Italy and Spain ) and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually , the most of any country in the world . France is a developed country with the world 's sixth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest by purchasing power parity . In terms of aggregate household wealth , it ranks fourth in the world . France performs well in international rankings of education , health care , life expectancy , and human development . France remains a great power in the world , being a founding member of the United Nations , where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council , and a founding and leading member state of the European Union ( EU ) . It is also a member of the Group of 7 , North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , and La Francophonie .   Etymology   Originally applied to the whole Frankish Empire , the name `` France '' comes from the Latin ' , or `` country of the Franks '' . Modern France is still named today Francia in Italian and Spanish , Frankreich in German and Frankrijk in Dutch , all of which have the same historical meaning .   There are various theories as to the origin of the name Frank . Following the precedents of Edward Gibbon and Jacob Grimm , the name of the Franks has been linked with the word frank ( free ) in English . It has been suggested that the meaning of `` free '' was adopted because , after the conquest of Gaul , only Franks were free of taxation ."], [350, "A pillar box is a type of free-standing post box . They are found in the United Kingdom and in most former nations of the British Empire , members of the Commonwealth of Nations and British overseas territories , such as Australia , Cyprus , India , Gibraltar , Hong Kong , the Republic of Ireland , Malta , New Zealand and Sri Lanka . Pillar boxes were provided in territories administered by the United Kingdom , such as Mandatory Palestine , and territories with Agency postal services provided by the British Post Office such as Bahrain , Dubai , Kuwait and Morocco . The United Kingdom also exported pillar boxes to countries that ran their own postal services , such as Argentina , Portugal and Uruguay .   Mail is deposited in pillar boxes to be collected by the Royal Mail , An Post or the appropriate postal operator and forwarded to the addressee . The boxes have been in use since 1852 , just twelve years after the introduction of the first adhesive postage stamps ( Penny Black ) and uniform penny post .   Mail may also be deposited in lamp boxes or wall boxes that serve the same purpose as pillar boxes but are attached to a post or set into a wall . According to the Letter Box Study Group , there are more than 150 recognised designs and varieties of pillar boxes and wall boxes , not all of which have known surviving examples . The red post box is regarded as a British cultural icon . Royal Mail estimates there are over 100,000 post boxes in the United Kingdom .   Construction   Most traditional British pillar boxes produced after 1905 are made of cast iron and are cylindrical . Other shapes have been used : the hexagonal Penfolds , rectangular boxes that have not proved to be popular , and an oval shape that is used mainly for the large `` double aperture '' boxes most often seen in large cities like London and Dublin . In recent years boxes manufactured in glass-fibre or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ( ABS ) plastic have been produced that do not follow these general outlines . These are for use in secure indoor locations such as supermarkets .   Cast iron pillar box construction comprises three distinct main parts :   The cap sits on top of the Carcass and is usually bolted down from inside . Some designs after 1965 do not have a separate cap . Caps can also be fitted with a separate bracket , normally of cast iron , which supports a Post Office Direction sign ( POD ) indicating the nearest Post Office .   The door contains the aperture or posting slot . It is hinged , should display the Royal Cypher of the reigning monarch and may also be fitted with a collection plate showing the times of collection from that location . It is fitted with a brass security lock on the inside . The contractor for these locks has been the Chubb Locks company for many years . They are 5 lever locks and each one can exhibit more than 6500 combinations . There is no skeleton key for these locks . Each post box has its own set of keys and postal workers have to carry large bunches with them when clearing the boxes .   The carcass or body of the box that supports the door and cap , and may protrude substantially down below ground level . This provides security and stability to the pillar box . There is a wirework cage inside to prevent mail falling out when the door is opened , a hinged letter chute to allow mail to fall into the collecting bag or sack and a serrated hand-guard to prevent unauthorised tampering with the mail through the aperture .   History   Pre-history   Before the introduction of pillar boxes , in the UK , it was customary to take outgoing mail to the nearest letter receiving house or post office . Such houses were usually coaching inns or turnpike houses where the Royal Mail coach would stop to pick up and set down mails and passengers . People took their letters , in person , to the receiver , or postmaster , purchased a stamp ( after 1840 ) and handed over the letter .   The Channel Island problem   The advent of the British wayside letter box can be traced to Sir Rowland Hill , Secretary of the Post Office , and his Surveyor for the Western District , and noted novelist , Anthony Trollope . Hill sent Trollope to the Channel Islands"], [351, "Mauritius ( ; ) , officially the Republic of Mauritius ( ) , is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 2000 km off the southeast coast of the African continent . The country includes the island of Mauritius , Rodrigues [ 560 km east ] , and the outer islands ( Agaléga , St. Brandon and two disputed territories ) . The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues ( 172 km southwest ) form part of the Mascarene Islands , along with nearby Réunion , a French overseas department . The area of the country is 2,040 km2 . The capital and largest city is Port Louis .   The island of Mauritius was visited during the Middle Ages by the Arabs and then by the Portuguese , who named it Dina Arobi and Cirne , respectively . The island was uninhabited until the Dutch Republic established a colony in 1638 , with the Dutch naming the island after Prince Maurice van Nassau . The Dutch colony was abandoned in 1710 , and , five years later , the island became a French colony and was named Isle de France . Due to its strategic position , Mauritius was known as the `` star and key '' of the Indian Ocean .   Mauritius became an important base on the trade routes from Europe to the East before the opening of the Suez Canal and was involved in the long power struggle between the French and the British . The French won the Battle of Grand Port , their only naval victory over the British during these wars , but they could not prevent the British from landing at Cap Malheureux three months later . They formally surrendered on the fifth day of the invasion , 3 December 1810 , on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property , the use of the French language , and the law of France in criminal and civil matters . Under British rule , the island became the Empire 's main sugar-producing colony . In the 20th century , movements to improve labour laws and introduce political reforms began to be organized , a process that accelerated after World War II . The country became an independent state on 12 March 1968 , following the adoption of a new constitution . In 1992 , Mauritius became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations .   The sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago is disputed between Mauritius and the United Kingdom ( UK ) . The UK excised the archipelago from Mauritian territory prior to Mauritian independence in 1965 . It gradually depopulated the archipelago 's indigenous population and leased its biggest island , Diego Garcia , to the United States . Mauritius also claims sovereignty over Tromelin Island from France .   The people of Mauritius are multiethnic , multi-religious , multicultural and multilingual . The island 's government is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system , and Mauritius is highly ranked for democracy and for economic and political freedom . Along with the other Mascarene Islands , Mauritius is known for its varied flora and fauna , with many species endemic to the island . The island is widely known as the only known home of the dodo , which , along with several other avian species , was made extinct by human activities relatively shortly after the island 's settlement .   Etymology   The first historical evidence of the existence of an island now known as Mauritius is on a map produced by the Italian cartographer Alberto Cantino in 1502 . From this , it appears that Mauritius was first named Dina Arobi during the Middle Ages by Arab sailors , the first people to visit the island .   In 1507 Portuguese sailors visited the uninhabited island . The island appears with a Portuguese name Cirne on early Portuguese maps , probably from the name of a ship in the 1507 expedition . Another Portuguese sailor , Dom Pedro Mascarenhas , gave the name Mascarenes to the Archipelago .   In 1598 a Dutch squadron under Admiral Wybrand van Warwyck landed at Grand Port and named the island Mauritius , in honour of Prince Maurice van Nassau , stadholder of the Dutch Republic . Later the island became a French colony and was renamed Isle de France . On 3 December 1810 the French surrendered the island during the Napoleonic Wars . Under British rule , the island 's name reverted to Mauritius . Mauritius is also commonly known as Maurice and Île Maurice in French , Moris in Mauritian Creole .   History   The island of Mauritius was uninhabited before its first recorded visit"], [352, "The terms ' ( AD or A.D. ) and before Christ ( BC or B.C . ) are used to label or number years in the Julian and Gregorian calendars . The term ' is Medieval Latin , which means in the year of the Lord but is often translated as in the year of our Lord . It is occasionally set out more fully as ' ( or Jesu ) ' ( `` in the year of Our Lord Jesus Christ '' ) .  Dionysius Exiguus of Scythia Minor introduced the AD system in AD 525 , counting the years since the birth of Christ .   This calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth , with AD counting years from the start of this epoch , and BC denoting years before the start of the era . There is no year zero in this scheme , so the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1 BC . This dating system was devised in 525 , but was not widely used until after 800 .   The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today . For decades , it has been the unofficial global standard , adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication , transportation , and commercial integration , and recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations .   Traditionally , English followed Latin usage by placing the `` AD '' abbreviation before the year number . However , BC is placed after the year number ( for example : AD , but 68 BC ) , which also preserves syntactic order . The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium , as in `` fourth century AD '' or `` second millennium AD '' ( although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions ) . Because BC is the English abbreviation for Before Christ , it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means After Death , i.e. , after the death of Jesus . However , this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would not be included in either of the BC and the AD time scales .   Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current , or Common Era ( abbreviated as CE or C.E . ) , with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common , Christian , or Current Era ( BCE or B.C.E . ) . Astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity , but use the same numbers for AD years .   History   The Anno Domini dating system was devised in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus to enumerate the years in his Easter table . His system was to replace the Diocletian era that had been used in an old Easter table because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians . The last year of the old table , Diocletian 247 , was immediately followed by the first year of his table , AD 532 . When he devised his table , Julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year—he himself stated that the `` present year '' was `` the consulship of Probus Junior '' , which was 525 years `` since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ '' . Thus Dionysius implied that Jesus ' Incarnation occurred 525 years earlier , without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred . `` However , nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system , whether consulate , Olympiad , year of the world , or regnal year of Augustus ; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date . ''   Blackburn & Holford-Strevens briefly present arguments for 2 BC , 1 BC , or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the Nativity or Incarnation . Among the sources of confusion are :  * In modern times , Incarnation is synonymous with the conception , but some ancient writers , such as Bede , considered Incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity  * The civil , or consular year began on 1 January but the Diocletian year began on 29 August ( 30 August in the year before a Julian leap year ) .  * There were inaccuracies in the list of consuls  * There were confused summations of emperors ' regnal years"], [353, "Carlos Alberto Martínez Tevez ( ; born 5 February 1984 ) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Boca Juniors and the Argentina national team .

He was accidentally scalded with boiling water as a child , which caused third-degree burns and kept him hospitalised in intensive care for nearly two months . After joining Boca Juniors , Tevez refused an offer from the club to have them cosmetically improved , saying that the scars were a part of who he was in the past and who he is today .   Club career   Boca Juniors   Aged 16 , Tevez made his debut for Boca Juniors against Talleres de Córdoba in the during the Torneo Apertura of the 2001–02 Argentine Primera División , on 21 October 2001 . Boca Juniors were crowned champions of the 2001 Copa Libertadores and faced Bayern Munich at the 2001 Intercontinental Cup on 27 November , where they lost 1–0 , however Tevez was not included in the squad . He went on to score 1 goal in 11 league appearances in the 2001–02 season . Boca had finished in 1st place of their 2002 Copa Libertadores group and had reached the quarter-final stage , where they faced Paraguay 's Club Olimpia . Tevez scored after 18 minutes in the first-leg to give Boca Juniors a 1–0 lead , until Olimpia levelled the scores in the 67th minute when Boca defender Cristian Traverso scored an own goal , on 8 May . Boca lost the second-leg 1–0 in Asunción on 16 May . Boca finished three points behind Independiente to finish in second position during the Torneo Apertura . Boca Juniors eventually finished four points behind River Plate to claim second position in the Torneo Clausura .   Tevez scored 10 goals in 32 appearances for Boca during the 2002–03 season . During the 2002 Copa Sudamericana , Boca were eliminated 3–1 on aggregate by Gimnasia de La Plata in the first-round . Boca Juniors participated at the 2003 Copa Libertadores and reached the final of the competition , where they faced Santos . Boca won 5–1 on aggregate , with Tevez scoring in Boca 's 3–1 away win in the second-leg . Tevez was also voted as the tournament 's best player"], [354, "The Thorn Birds is a 1977 best-selling novel by the Australian author Colleen McCullough . Set primarily on Drogheda—a fictional sheep station in the Australian Outback named after Drogheda , Ireland—the story focuses on the Cleary family and spans the years 1915 to 1969 .   In 1983 , the novel was adapted into a television miniseries that , during its run 27–30 March , became the United States ' second highest-rated miniseries of all time behind Roots . The miniseries starred Richard Chamberlain , Rachel Ward , Barbara Stanwyck , Christopher Plummer , Richard Kiley , Bryan Brown , Mare Winningham , Philip Anglim , and Jean Simmons . It was directed by Daryl Duke and produced by television veteran David L. Wolper ( who also produced Roots ) .   Plot   The epic begins with Meghann `` Meggie '' Cleary , a four-year-old girl living in New Zealand in the early twentieth century , the only daughter of Paddy , an Irish farm labourer , and Fee , his harassed but aristocratic wife . Although Meggie is a beautiful child with curly red-gold hair , she receives little coddling and must struggle to hold her own against her numerous older brothers . Of these brothers , her favourite is the eldest , Frank , a rebellious young man who is unwillingly preparing himself for the blacksmith 's trade . He is much shorter than his brothers , but very strong ; also , unlike the other Clearys , he has black hair and eyes .   Paddy is poor , but has a wealthy sister , Mary Carson , who lives in Australia on an enormous sheep station called Drogheda . One day , Paddy receives a letter from Mary offering him a job on her estate , Drogheda .   In Drogheda , Meggie meets Ralph de Bricassart , a young , capable , and ambitious priest who , as punishment for insulting a bishop , has been relegated to a remote parish in the town of Gillanbone , near Drogheda . Ralph has befriended Mary , hoping a hefty enough bequest from her to the Catholic Church might liberate him from his exile . Ralph is strikingly handsome , `` a beautiful man '' ; Mary , who does not bother to conceal her desire for him , often goes to great lengths to see if he can be induced to break his vows . Ralph blandly shrugs off these attentions and continues his visits . Meanwhile , he cares for all the Clearys and soon learns to cherish beautiful but forlorn little Meggie . Meggie , in return , makes Ralph the centre of her life .   Frank 's relationship with his father , Paddy , has never been peaceful . The two vie for Fee 's attention , and Frank resents the many pregnancies Paddy makes her endure . One day , after Fee , now in her forties , reveals she is again pregnant , the two men quarrel violently and Paddy blurts out the truth about Frank : he is not Paddy 's biological son . Long ago , Fee had been the adored only daughter of a prominent citizen . Then she had an affair with a married politician , and the result , Frank , was already eighteen months old when her mortified father married her off to Paddy . Because he resembles her lost love , Fee has always loved Frank more than her other children . To the sorrow of Meggie and Fee , when Frank learns that Paddy is only his stepfather , he runs away to become a prizefighter . Fee later gives birth to twin boys , James and Patrick ( Jims and Patsy ) , but shows little interest in them . Shortly afterward , Meggie 's beloved little brother , Hal , dies .   With Frank gone and Hal dead , Meggie clings to Ralph more than ever . This goes largely unnoticed because Ralph has now been her mentor for several years ; however , as she ripens into womanhood , some begin to question their close relationship , including Ralph and Meggie themselves . Mary Carson has also noticed their changing relationship , and from motives of jealousy mingled with Machiavellian cruelty , she devises a plan to separate Ralph from Meggie by tempting him with his heart 's desire : a high place in the Church hierarchy . Although her will of record leaves the bulk of her estate to Paddy , she quietly writes a new one , making the Roman Catholic Church the main beneficiary and Ralph the executor .   In the new will , the"], [355, "( , , or ; Greek : , from λέγω lego `` I say '' ) is an important term in western philosophy , psychology , rhetoric , and religion . It is a Greek word meaning `` a ground '' , `` a plea '' , `` an opinion '' , `` an expectation '' , `` word '' , `` speech '' , `` account '' , `` to reason '' , but it became a technical term in philosophy beginning with Heraclitus ( ca . 535–475 BC ) , who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge .   Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways . The sophists used the term to mean discourse , and Aristotle applied the term to refer to `` reasoned discourse '' or `` the argument '' in the field of rhetoric . The Stoic philosophers identified the term with the divine animating principle pervading the Universe . Under Hellenistic Judaism , Philo ( c. 20 BC – AD 50 ) adopted the term into Jewish philosophy . The Gospel of John identifies the Logos , through which all things are made , as divine ( theos ) , May , Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger . The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha . 1977. and further identifies Jesus Christ as the incarnate Logos . Although the term `` Logos '' is widely used in this Christian sense , in academic circles it often refers to the various ancient Greek uses , or to post-Christian uses within contemporary philosophy , Sufism , and the analytical psychology of Carl Jung .   Despite the conventional translation as `` word '' , it is not used for a word in the grammatical sense ; instead , the term lexis ( λέξις ) was used . However , both logos and lexis derive from the same verb legō ( λέγω ) , meaning `` to count , tell , say , speak '' .   Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a `` premise . '' She states that , to find the reason behind a rhetor 's backing of a certain position or stance , one must acknowledge the different `` premises '' that the rhetor applies via his or her chosen diction . She continues by stating that the rhetor 's success will come down to `` certain objects of agreement ... between arguer and audience . '' `` Logos is logical appeal , and the term logic is derived from it . It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker 's topic . '' Furthermore , logos is credited with appealing to the audience 's sense of logic , with the definition of “ logic ” being concerned with the thing as it is known .  Furthermore , you can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways : 1 ) through inductive logic , providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement ; 2 ) through deductive enthymeme , providing the audience with general scenarios and then pulling out a certain truth .   Philo distinguished between logos prophorikos ( `` the uttered word '' ) and the logos endiathetos ( `` the word remaining within '' ) . The Stoics also spoke of the logos spermatikos ( the generative principle of the Universe ) , which is not important in the Biblical tradition but is relevant in Neoplatonism . Early translators from Greek , such as Jerome in the 4th century , were frustrated by the inadequacy of any single Latin word to convey the Logos expressed in the Gospel of John . The Vulgate Bible usage of in principio erat verbum was thus constrained to use the ( perhaps inadequate ) noun verbum for `` word '' , but later romance language translations had the advantage of nouns such as le mot in French . Reformation translators took another approach . Martin Luther rejected Zeitwort ( verb ) in favor of Wort ( word ) , for instance , although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving the living word as felt by Jerome and Augustine .   Ancient Greek philosophy   Heraclitus   The writing of Heraclitus ( c. 535 – c. 475 BC ) was the first place where the word logos was given special attention in ancient Greek philosophy , although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time . For Heraclitus , logos provided the link between rational discourse and the world 's"], [356, "A federal district is a type of administrative division of a federation , under the direct control of a federal government . Federal districts often include capital districts , and they exist in states and countries worldwide .   United States   The seat of the U.S. federal government in Washington , D.C. is a federal district known as the `` District of Columbia '' , which is not part of any U.S. state . Other federally administered areas that are within a state , but not under its jurisdiction are called federal enclaves . In main addition , the U.S. government has several other kinds of `` federal districts '' which are not specifically related to a capital city :   * The federal court system divides each state principal , the District of Columbia , and Puerto Rico , into one or more federal judicial districts . A United States district court and a bankruptcy court are located in each . There are also regional federal judicial circuits , each consisting of a group of states ( except for the District of Columbia Circuit , which consists only of the federal district , and the Federal Circuit , whose jurisdiction is based on specific subject matter instead of geography ) ; Puerto Rico and the United States territorial courts are also assigned to circuits . Each circuit has a United States court of appeals .   Latin America   The term Distrito Federal , meaning `` Federal District '' in both the Portuguese and Spanish languages , is used to refer to :   * Federal Capital ( Argentina ) , formally Autonomous City of Buenos Aires , since 1994 .  * Federal District ( Brazil )  * Federal District ( Mexico ) , an alternative official term for Mexico City until January 2016 .  * Capital District ( Venezuela )  * Distrito Central , Tegucigalpa , capital of Honduras   Asia   In Malaysia , the term Federal Territory ( Malay : Wilayah Persekutuan ) is used for the three territories governed directly by the federal government , namely Kuala Lumpur ( national capital ) , Putrajaya ( federal government administrative centre ) and Labuan ( international offshore financial centre ) .   In India , the term Union Territory is used for the seven territories governed directly by the federal national government with its own Chief minister and Governor . They include — Andaman and Nicobar Islands , Chandigarh , Dadra and Nagar Haveli , Daman and Diu , Delhi , Lakshadweep and Puducherry . Of these Delhi and Puducherry possess partial state hoods with their own elected chief ministers .   In Pakistan , the term Federal Territory is used for the five zones and 12 union councils of Islamabad governed directly by the state government as Islamabad Capital Territory .   Australia   The Australian Capital Territory is enclaved within the state of New South Wales . Its only city is Canberra , the capital of Australia .   Russia   There are nine federal districts of Russia , which function as an additional administrative layer between other subdivisions and the Russian Federation as a whole state . There are also three cities of federal significance , established by the Constitution — Moscow , Saint Petersburg and Sevastopol . Each city is treated as separate subject of federation , and has its own legislative body ."], [357, "A drag queen is a person , usually male , who dresses in drag and often acts with exaggerated femininity and in feminine gender roles . Often they will exaggerate certain characteristics such as make-up and eyelashes for comic , dramatic , or satirical effect . While drag is very much associated with gay men and gay culture , there are drag artists of all sexualities and genders . There are many kinds of drag artists and they vary greatly in dedication , from professionals who have starred in films to people who just try it once , or those who simply prefer clothing and makeup that is usually worn by the opposite sex in their culture . Drag queens can vary widely by class and culture . Other drag performers include drag kings , women who perform in male roles and attire , faux queens , who are women who dress in an exaggerated style to emulate drag queens , and faux kings , who are men who dress to impersonate drag kings .   There are many reasons people do drag including self-expression , comfort , transvestic fetishism , and spiritual reasons , as well as the higher-profile performing and entertaining . Drag can be a creative outlet , a means of self-exploration , and a way to make cultural statements . While the general public may be most familiar with the `` high drag '' of professional performance artists , drag is also part of regular life and street culture for many gender-nonconforming or gender-variant people , who may or may not consider what they do , `` drag . '' Drag queen activities among stage and street performers may include lip-synching performances , live singing , dancing , participating in events such as gay pride parades , drag pageants , or at venues such as cabarets and discotheques . Some drag artists also engage in mix-and-mingle or hosting work in night clubs , such as drag bingo , and at private parties and events . Famous drag queens include Divine , Dame Edna Everage , Lily Savage , Lady Bunny , RuPaul , Bianca Del Rio , Raven ( drag queen ) , Raja Gemini , Jinkx Monsoon , Sharon Needles , Willam , Violet Chachki , Alyssa Edwards , Shangela Laquifa Wadley , Manila Luzon , Courtney Act , Pearl Liaison , Jackie Beat , Adore Delano , Tyra Sanchez , Trixie Mattel , Katya Zamolodchikova , Naomi Smalls , Kim Chi , Bob the Drag Queen , Thorgy Thor , Acid Betty , Conchita Wurst .   Terminology   Drag queen   The etymology of the term `` drag queen '' is disputed . The term drag queen occurred in Polari , a subset of English slang that was popular in some gay communities in the early part of the 20th century . Its first recorded use to refer to actors dressed in women 's clothing is from 1870 .   A folk etymology is that drag is an acronym of `` Dressed Resembling A Girl '' in description of male theatrical transvestism .   Queen may refer to the trait of affected royalty found in the personalities of many who do drag ( whether this is their normal personality or a character created for the stage ) . It is also related to the Old English word `` quean '' or cwene , which originally simply meant `` woman '' , then was later used as a label both for promiscuous women and gay men ( see Oxford English Dictionary definition number 3 for `` queen '' ) .  The OE word apprears derived from  Middle Dutch quene ( `` old woman '' ) , ultimately from  Proto-Germanic * kwenǭ ( `` woman '' ) , from Proto-Indo-European * gʷḗn ( `` woman '' ) .   Drag as a term referring to women 's clothing worn by men has less clear origins . According to one theory , it was used in reference to transvestites at least as early as the 18th century , owing to the tendency of their skirts to drag on the ground . Another possibility is that it derives from the Romani word for skirt , which appears in a number of Romani dialects of Northern Europe with forms like daraka and jendraka .   Female impersonator   Another term for a drag queen , female impersonator , is still used—though it is sometimes regarded as inaccurate , because not all contemporary drag performers are attempting to pass as women . Female impersonation has been and continues to be illegal in some places , which inspired the drag queen José Sarria to hand out labels to"], [358, "No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American neo-Western thriller film directed , written , and edited by Joel and Ethan Coen , based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name . Starring Tommy Lee Jones , Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin , it tells the story of a Texas welder and Vietnam veteran to whom chance and greed deliver a fate that is neither wanted nor denied ; a cat-and-mouse drama set in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas . Themes of fate , conscience , and circumstance are explored ; ones that the Coen brothers have previously explored in Blood Simple and Fargo .   The film premiered in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on May 19 . It won four awards at the 80th Academy Awards – Best Picture , Best Director , Best Supporting Actor ( Bardem ) and Best Adapted Screenplay , allowing the Coen brothers to join four previous directors honored three times for a single film . In addition , the film won three British Academy Film Awards ( BAFTA ) including Best Director , and two Golden Globes . The American Film Institute listed it as an AFI Movie of the Year , and the National Board of Review selected the film as the best of 2007 .   More critics included No Country for Old Men on their 2007 top ten lists than any other film , and many regard it as the Coen brothers ' masterpiece , as well as one of the best films of the 2000s . The Guardians John Patterson said `` the Coens ' technical abilities , and their feel for a landscape-based Western classicism reminiscent of Anthony Mann and Sam Peckinpah , are matched by few living directors '' , and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that it is `` a new career peak for the Coen brothers '' and `` as entertaining as hell '' .   Plot   Terrell County , Texas in June 1980 is desolate , expansive country , and Ed Tom Bell ( Tommy Lee Jones ) laments the increasing violence in a region where he , like his father and grandfather before him , has risen to the office of sheriff . In a neighboring county , Anton Chigurh ( Javier Bardem ) , a hitman , strangles a sheriff 's deputy to escape custody and steals a car by using a captive bolt pistol to kill the driver .   While hunting in the desert , Llewelyn Moss ( Josh Brolin ) comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone awry . He finds several dead men and dogs , a wounded Mexican begging for water , and two million dollars in a briefcase . He takes the money and returns home . That night , Moss returns to the scene with water . He is pursued by two men in a truck and escapes . At home , he sends his wife , Carla Jean ( Kelly Macdonald ) , to stay with her mother , then drives to a motel in Del Rio , where he hides the case in the air vent of his room .   Chigurh , hired to recover the money , abruptly kills his employers after obtaining a clue to Moss 's identity . Arriving to search Moss 's home , he uses his bolt pistol to blow the lock out of the door . Investigating the break in , Sheriff Bell notices the blown-out lock . Using a tracking device hidden with the money , Chigurh goes to Moss 's motel and kills a group of Mexicans who are preparing to ambush Moss in his room . Moss has rented a second room adjacent to the Mexicans ' room with access to the same vent in which the money is hidden . He retrieves the briefcase just before Chigurh opens the vent and finds it empty .   While staying at a hotel in Eagle Pass , Moss discovers the tracking device , but Chigurh has already found him . Their firefight spills onto the streets and both are wounded . Moss flees to Mexico where he collapses and is helped to a hospital . Carson Wells , another hired operative , fails to persuade him to accept protection in return for the money . Chigurh cleans and stitches his own wounds with stolen supplies and kills Wells at his hotel . Moss telephones the room and Chigurh answers . Lifting his boots to avoid Wells 's blood , Chigurh tells Moss that he will kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money ; he remarks that he will kill Moss regardless of whether"], [359, "The four cardinal directions or cardinal points are the directions of north , east , south , and west , commonly denoted by their initials : N , E , S , W. East and west are at right angles to north and south , with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east . Intermediate points between the four cardinal directions form the points of the compass . The intermediate ( intercardinal , or ordinal ) directions are northeast ( NE ) , southeast ( SE ) , southwest ( SW ) , and northwest ( NW ) . Further , the intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction , the eight shortest points in the compass rose to the right , i.e . NNE , ENE , ESE , and so on .   Locating the directions   Direction versus bearing   To keep to a bearing is not , in general , the same as going in a straight direction along a great circle . Conversely , one can keep to a great circle and the bearing may change . Thus the bearing of a straight path crossing the North Pole changes abruptly at the Pole from North to South . When travelling East or West , it is only on the Equator that one can keep East or West and be going straight ( without need to steer ) . Anywhere else , maintaining latitude requires a change in direction , requires steering . However , this change in direction becomes increasingly negligible as one moves to lower latitudes .   Magnetic compass   The Earth has a magnetic field which is approximately aligned with its axis of rotation . A magnetic compass is a device that uses this field to determine the cardinal directions . Magnetic compasses are extremely widely used , but only moderately accurate .   The Sun   The position of the Sun in the sky can be used for orientation if the general time of day is known . In the morning , the Sun rises roughly in the east ( due east only on the equinoxes ) and tracks upwards . In the evening it sets in the west , again roughly and only due west exactly on the equinoxes . In the middle of the day it is to the south for viewers in the Northern Hemisphere , who live north of the Tropic of Cancer , and the north for those in the Southern Hemisphere , who live south of the Tropic of Capricorn . This method works less well closer to the equator ( i.e . between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn ) since , in the northern hemisphere , the sun may be directly overhead or even to the north in summer . Conversely , at low latitudes in the southern hemisphere the sun may be to the south of the observer in summer . In these locations , one needs first to determine whether the sun is moving from east to west through north or south by watching its movements—left to right means it is going through south while right to left means it is going through north ; or one can watch the sun 's shadows . If they move clockwise , the sun will be in the south at midday , and if they move anticlockwise , then the sun will be in the north at midday .   Due to the Earth 's axial tilt , no matter what the location of the viewer , there are only two days each year when the sun rises precisely due east . These days are the equinoxes . On all other days , depending on the time of year , the sun rises either north or south of true east ( and sets north or south of true west ) . For all locations the sun is seen to rise north of east ( and set north of west ) from the Northward equinox to the Southward equinox , and rise south of east ( and set south of west ) from the Southward equinox to the Northward equinox .   A more accurate fix can be made if the time of year and approximate latitude are factored in . The amount that the sun appears to be either north or south depends on both the time of year and latitude of the observer . Knowing these will enable the observer to be more precise when determining the cardinal directions from the sun 's position , particularly in the early morning or late afternoon ."], [360, "Flanders ( Dutch : Vlaanderen , ) today normally refers to the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium . It is one of the communities , regions and language areas of Belgium . The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming , while the corresponding adjective is Flemish . The official capital of Flanders is Brussels , although Brussels itself has an independent regional government , and the government of Flanders only oversees some cultural aspects of Brussels life .   Historically , the name referred to the County of Flanders ( Flandria ) , which around AD 1000 stretched from the Strait of Dover to the Scheldt estuary . The only parts of historical Flanders situated within modern-day Flanders are the provinces West Flanders and East Flanders . Nevertheless , during the 19th and 20th centuries it became increasingly commonplace to use the term `` Flanders '' to refer to the entire Dutch-speaking part of Belgium , stretching all the way to the River Maas . In accordance with late 20th century Belgian state reforms the area was made into two political entities : the `` Flemish Community '' ( ) and the `` Flemish Region '' ( ) . These entities were merged , although geographically the Flemish Community , which has a broader cultural mandate , covers Brussels , whereas the Flemish Region does not .   Flanders has figured prominently in European history . During the late Middle Ages , cities such as Ghent , Bruges , Antwerp and Brussels made it one of the richest and most urbanized parts of Europe , weaving the wool of neighbouring lands into cloth for both domestic use and export . As a consequence , a very sophisticated culture developed , with impressive achievements in the arts and architecture , rivaling those of northern Italy . Belgium was one of the centres of the 19th century industrial revolution but Flanders was at first overtaken by French-speaking Wallonia . In the second half of the 20th century , however , Flanders ' economy modernised rapidly , and today Flanders is significantly more wealthy than its southern counterpart .   Geographically , Flanders is generally flat , and has a small section of coast on the North Sea . Much of Flanders is agriculturally fertile and densely populated , with a population density of almost 500 people per square kilometer ( 1,200 per square mile ) . It borders France to the west , the Netherlands to the north and east , and Wallonia to the south . The Brussels Capital Region is an enclave within the Flemish Region . Flanders has exclaves of its own : Voeren in the east is between Wallonia and the Netherlands and Baarle-Hertog in the north consists of 22 exclaves surrounded by the Netherlands .   Terminology   In Belgium   The term `` Flanders '' has several main meanings :  * The `` Flemish community '' or `` Flemish nation '' , i.e . the social , cultural and linguistic , scientific and educational , economical and political community of the Flemings . It comprises 6.5 million Belgians ( 60 % ) who consider Dutch to be their mother tongue .  * The political subdivisions of Belgium : the Flemish Region ( competent in mainly economic matters ) and the Flemish Community ( competent in mainly cultural matters ) . The first does not comprise Brussels ( which forms a Region on itself ) , whereas the latter does .  * The political institutions that govern both subdivisions : the operative body `` Flemish Government '' and the legislative organ `` Flemish Parliament '' .  * The two westernmost provinces of the Flemish Region , West Flanders and East Flanders , forming the central portion of the historic County of Flanders .   In Belgium and neighbouring countries   * A feudal territory that existed from the 8th century ( Flandria ) until its absorption by the French First Republic . Until the 1600s , this county also extended over parts of France and the Netherlands .  * One of the regions conquered by the French in Flanders , namely French Flanders in the Nord department . French Flanders can be divided into two smaller regions : Lilloise Flanders and Maritime Flanders . The first region was predominantly French-speaking already in the 1600s , the latter became so in the 20th century . The city of Lille identifies itself as `` Flemish '' , and this is reflected , for instance , in the name of its local railway station TGV Lille Flandres .  * The region conquered by the Dutch Republic in Flanders , now part of the Dutch province of"], [361, "The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred at 00:58:53 UTC on 26 December with the epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra , Indonesia . The shock had a moment magnitude of 9.1–9.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX ( Violent ) . The undersea megathrust earthquake was caused when the Indian Plate was subducted by the Burma Plate and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean , killing 230,000 people in 14 countries , and inundating coastal communities with waves up to 30 m high . It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history . Indonesia was the hardest-hit country , followed by Sri Lanka , India , and Thailand .   It is the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph and had the longest duration of faulting ever observed , between 8.3 and 10 minutes . It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1 cm and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska . Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia . The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response . In all , the worldwide community donated more than US $ 14 billion ( 2004 ) in humanitarian aid . The event is known by the scientific community as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake . The resulting tsunami was given various names , including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , South Asian tsunami , Indonesian tsunami , the Christmas tsunami and the Boxing Day tsunami .   Earthquake characteristics   The earthquake was initially documented as moment magnitude 8.8 . In February 2005 scientists revised the estimate of the magnitude to 9.0 . Although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has accepted these new numbers , the United States Geological Survey has so far not changed its estimate of 9.1 . The most recent studies in 2006 have obtained a magnitude of Mw 9.1–9.3 . Dr. Hiroo Kanamori of the California Institute of Technology believes that Mw 9.2 is a good representative value for the size of this great earthquake .   The hypocentre of the main earthquake was approximately 160 km off the western coast of northern Sumatra , in the Indian Ocean just north of Simeulue island at a depth of 30 km below mean sea level ( initially reported as 10 km ) . The northern section of the Sunda megathrust ruptured over a length of 1300 km . The earthquake ( followed by the tsunami ) was felt simultaneously in Bangladesh , India , Malaysia , Myanmar , Thailand , Singapore and the Maldives . Splay faults , or secondary `` pop up faults '' , caused long , narrow parts of the sea floor to pop up in seconds . This quickly elevated the height and increased the speed of waves , causing the complete destruction of the nearby Indonesian town of Lhoknga .   Indonesia lies between the Pacific Ring of Fire along the north-eastern islands adjacent to New Guinea , and the Alpide belt that runs along the south and west from Sumatra , Java , Bali , Flores to Timor .   Great earthquakes such as the Sumatra-Andaman event , which are invariably associated with megathrust events in subduction zones , have seismic moments that can account for a significant fraction of the global earthquake moment across century-scale time periods . Of all the seismic moment released by earthquakes in the 100 years from 1906 through 2005 , roughly one-eighth was due to the Sumatra-Andaman event . This quake , together with the Good Friday earthquake ( Alaska , 1964 ) and the Great Chilean earthquake ( 1960 ) , account for almost half of the total moment . The much smaller but still catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake is included in the diagram for perspective . Mw denotes the magnitude of an earthquake on the moment magnitude scale .   Since 1900 the only earthquakes recorded with a greater magnitude were the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake ( magnitude 9.5 ) and the 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Prince William Sound ( 9.2 ) . The only other recorded earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater were off Kamchatka , Russia , on 4 November 1952 ( magnitude 9.0 ) and Tōhoku , Japan ( magnitude 9.0 ) in March 2011 . Each of these megathrust earthquakes also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean . However , the death toll from these was significantly lower , primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas and the much greater distances to more populated coasts and also due to the superior infrastructure and warning systems in MEDCs ( More Economically"], [362, "Sicherheitsdienst ( ) , full title Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsführers-SS ( ) , or SD , was the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany . The organization was the first Nazi Party intelligence organization to be established and was considered a sister organization with the Gestapo , which the SS had infiltrated heavily after 1934 . Between 1933 and 1939 , the SD was administered as an independent SS office , after which it was transferred to the authority of the Reich Main Security Office ( Reichssicherheitshauptamt ; RSHA ) , as one of its seven departments/offices . Its first director , Reinhard Heydrich , intended for the SD to bring every single individual within the Third Reich 's reach under `` continuous supervision . ''   Following Germany 's defeat in World War II , the SD was declared a criminal organisation at the Nuremberg Trials , along with the rest of Heydrich 's RSHA ( including the Gestapo ) both individually and as branches of the SS in the collective . Heydrich 's successor , Ernst Kaltenbrunner , was sentenced to death for war crimes at the Nuremberg Tribunals and hanged in 1946 .   History   The SD was one of the oldest security organizations of the SS and was first formed in 1931 as the Ic-Dienst , operating out of a single apartment and reporting directly to Heinrich Himmler . Himmler appointed a former naval officer , Reinhard Heydrich , to organise the small agency . The office was renamed Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ) in the summer of 1932 . The SD became more powerful after the Nazis took control of Germany and the SS started infiltrating all leading positions of the security apparatus of the Reich . Even before Hitler came to power , the SD was a veritable `` watchdog '' over the SS and members of the Nazi Party and played a critical role in consolidating political police powers into the hands of Himmler and Heydrich .   Growth of SD and SS power   Once Hitler was appointed Chancellor by German President , Paul von Hindenburg , he quickly made efforts to manipulate the aging president . On 28 February 1933 , Hitler convinced Hindenburg to declare a state of emergency which suspended all civil liberties throughout Germany , due at least in part to the Reichstag fire the night before , assuring Hindenburg throughout that he was attempting to stabilize the tumultuous political scene in Germany by taking a `` defensive measure against Communist acts of violence endangering the state . '' Wasting no time , Himmler set the SD in motion as they began creating an extensive card index of the Nazi regime 's political opponents , arresting labor organizers , socialists , Jewish leaders , journalists , and communists in the process , sending them to their new prison facility near Munich , Dachau . Himmler 's SS and SD made their presence felt at once by helping rid the regime of its known political enemies and its perceived ones , as well . As far as Heydrich and Himmler were concerned , the SD left their mission somewhat vaguely defined so as to `` remain an instrument for all eventualities . '' One of those eventualities would soon arise .   For a while , the SS was in ‘ competition ’ with the Sturmabteilung ( SA ) for influence within the Third Reich . Himmler distrusted the SA and came to deplore the ‘ rabble-rousing ’ brownshirts ( despite once having been a member ) and what they considered to be the indecent sexual deviants amid its leadership . At least one pretext to secure additional influence for Himmler 's SS and Heydrich 's SD in `` protecting '' Hitler and securing his absolute trust in their intelligence collection abilities involved thwarting a plot from Ernst Roehm 's SA using subversive means .   On 20 April 1934 Hermann Göring handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler . Heydrich , named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934 , also continued as head of the SD . These events further extended Himmler ’ s control of the security mechanism of the Reich , which by proxy also strengthened the surveillance power of Heydrich ’ s SD , as both entities methodically infiltrated every police agency in Germany . Thereafter , the SD was made the sole `` Party information service '' on 9 June 1934 .   Under pressure from the Reichswehr ( German armed forces ) leadership , whose members viewed the enormous armed forces of the SA as an existential threat and with the collusion of Göring ,"], [363, "At the Battle of Omdurman ( 2 September 1898 ) , an army commanded by the British General Sir Herbert Kitchener defeated the army of Abdullah al-Taashi , the successor to the self-proclaimed Mahdi , Muhammad Ahmad . Kitchener was seeking revenge for the death of General Gordon in 1884 . It was a demonstration of the superiority of a highly disciplined army equipped with modern rifles , machine guns and artillery over a force twice their size armed with older weapons , and marked the success of British efforts to re-conquer the Sudan . However , it was not until the 1899 Battle of Umm Diwaykarat that the final Mahdist forces were defeated .   Omdurman is today a suburb of Khartoum in central Sudan , with a population of some 1.5 million . The village of Omdurman was chosen in 1884 as the base of operations by the Mahdi , Muhammad Ahmad . After his death in 1885 , following the successful siege of Khartoum , his successor ( Khalifa ) Abdullah retained it as his capital .   Battle account   The battle took place at Kerreri , 11 km north of Omdurman . Kitchener commanded a force of 8,000 British regulars and a mixed force of 17,000 Sudanese and Egyptian troops . He arrayed his force in an arc around the village of Egeiga , close to the bank of the Nile , where a twelve gunboat flotilla waited in support , facing a wide , flat plain with hills rising to the left and right . The British and Egyptian cavalry were placed on either flank .   Abdullah 's followers , known as Ansar and sometimes referred to as Dervishes , numbered around 50,000 , including some 3,000 cavalry . They were split into five groups—a force of 8,000 under Osman Azrak was arrayed directly opposite the British , in a shallow arc along a mile ( 1.6 km ) of a low ridge leading onto the plain , and the other Mahdist forces were initially concealed from Kitchener 's force . Abdullah al-Taashi and 17,000 men were concealed behind the Surgham Hills to the west and rear of Osman Azrak 's force , with 20,000 more positioned to the north-west , close to the front behind the Kerreri hills , commanded by Ali-Wad-Helu and Sheikh ed-Din . A final force of around 8,000 was gathered on the slope on the right flank of Azrak 's force .   The battle began in the early morning , at around 6:00 a.m. After the clashes of the previous day , the 8,000 men under Osman Azrak advanced straight at the waiting British , quickly followed by about 8,000 of those waiting to the northwest , a mixed force of rifle and spear-men . The 52 quick firing guns of the British artillery opened fire at around 2750 m , inflicting severe casualties on the Mahdist forces before they even came within range of the Maxim guns and volley fire . The frontal attack ended quickly , with around 4,000 Mahdist casualties ; none of the attackers got closer than 50 m to the British trenches . A flanking move from the Ansar right was also checked , and there were bloody clashes on the opposite flank that scattered the Mahdist forces there .   Kitchener was anxious to occupy Omdurman before the remaining Mahdist forces could withdraw there . He advanced his army on the city , arranging them in separate columns for the attack . The British light cavalry regiment , the 21st Lancers , was sent ahead to clear the plain to Omdurman . They had a tough time of it . The 400-strong regiment attacked what they thought were only a few hundred dervishes , but in fact there were 2,500 infantry hidden behind them in a depression . After a fierce clash , the Lancers drove them back ( resulting in three Victoria Crosses being awarded to Lancers who helped rescue wounded comrades ) . One of the participants of this fight was Lieutenant Winston Churchill . On a larger scale , the British advance allowed the Khalifa to re-organize his forces . He still had over 30,000 men in the field and directed his main reserve to attack from the west while ordering the forces to the northwest to attack simultaneously over the Kerreri Hills .   Kitchener 's force wheeled left in echelon to advance up Surgham ridge and then southwards . To protect the rear , a brigade of 3,000 mainly Sudanese , commanded by Hector MacDonald , was reinforced with Maxims and artillery and followed the main force at around 1350 m.

Nixon had previously served as a U.S. Representative and Senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961 .   Nixon was born in Yorba Linda , California . After completing his undergraduate studies at Whittier College , he graduated from Duke University School of Law in 1937 and returned to California to practice law . He and his wife , Pat Nixon , moved to Washington in 1942 to work for the federal government . He subsequently served on active duty in the U.S. Navy Reserve during World War II . Nixon was elected to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950 . His pursuit of the Hiss Case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist , and elevated him to national prominence . He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election . Nixon served for eight years as vice president . He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960 , narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy , and lost a race for Governor of California to Pat Brown in 1962 . In 1968 he ran again for the presidency and was elected when he defeated Hubert Humphrey .   Nixon ended American involvement in the war in Vietnam in 1973 and brought the American POWs home . At the same time , he ended military draft . Nixon 's visit to the People 's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations , and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year . His administration generally transferred power from Washington to the states . He imposed wage and price controls for a period of ninety days , enforced desegregation of Southern schools and established the Environmental Protection Agency . Nixon also presided over the Apollo 11 moon landing , which signaled the end of the moon race . He was reelected by one of the largest landslides in U.S. history in 1972 , when he defeated George McGovern .   The year 1973 saw an Arab oil embargo , gasoline rationing , and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal . The scandal escalated , costing Nixon much of his political support , and on August 9 , 1974 , he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office . After his resignation , he was issued a pardon by his successor , Gerald Ford . In retirement , Nixon 's work writing several books and undertaking of many foreign trips helped to rehabilitate his image . He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18 , 1994 , and died four days later at the age of 81 .   Early life   Richard Milhous Nixon was born on January 9 , 1913 in Yorba Linda , California , in a house his father built . He was the son of Hannah ( Milhous ) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon . His mother was a Quaker and his father converted from Methodism to the Quaker faith ; Nixon 's upbringing was marked by evangelical Quaker observances of the time , such as refraining from alcohol , dancing , and swearing . Nixon had four brothers : Harold ( 1909–33 ) , Donald ( 1914–87 ) , Arthur ( 1918–25 ) , and Edward ( born 1930 ) . Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in historical or legendary England ; Richard , for example , was named after Richard the Lionheart .   Nixon 's early life was marked by hardship , and he later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to describe his boyhood : `` We were poor , but the glory of it was we did n't know it '' . The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922 , and the family moved to Whittier , California . In an area with many Quakers , Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station . Richard 's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 after a short illness . At the age of twelve , Richard was found to have a spot on his lung and , with a family history of tuberculosis , he was forbidden to play sports . Eventually , the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia .   Primary and secondary"], [365, "This article is for the volcanic arc . For the namesake mountain range see Cascade Range .   The Cascade Volcanoes ( also known as the Cascade Volcanic Arc or the Cascade Arc ) are a number of volcanoes in a volcanic arc in western North America , extending from southwestern British Columbia through Washington and Oregon to Northern California , a distance of well over 700 mi . The arc has formed due to subduction along the Cascadia subduction zone . Although taking its name from the Cascade Range , this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one , and the Cascade Volcanoes extend north into the Coast Mountains , past the Fraser River which is the northward limit of the Cascade Range proper .   Some of the major cities along the length of the arc include Portland , Seattle , and Vancouver , and the population in the region exceeds 10,000,000 people . All could be potentially affected by volcanic activity and great subduction-zone earthquakes along the arc . Because the population of the Pacific Northwest is rapidly increasing , the Cascade volcanoes are some of the most dangerous , due to their eruptive history and potential for future eruptions , and because they are underlain by weak , hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks that are susceptible to failure . Consequently , Mount Rainier is one of the Decade Volcanoes identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth 's Interior ( IAVCEI ) as being worthy of particular study , due to the danger it poses to Seattle and Tacoma . Many large , long-runout landslides originating on Cascade volcanoes have inundated valleys tens of kilometers from their sources , and some of the inundated areas now support large populations .   The Cascade Volcanoes are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire , the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean . The Cascade Volcanoes have erupted several times in recorded history . Two most recent were Lassen Peak in 1914 to 1921 and a major eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 . It is also the site of Canada 's most recent major eruption about 2,350 years ago at the Mount Meager volcanic complex .   Geology   The Cascade Arc includes nearly 20 major volcanoes , among a total of over 4,000 separate volcanic vents including numerous stratovolcanoes , shield volcanoes , lava domes , and cinder cones , along with a few isolated examples of rarer volcanic forms such as tuyas . Volcanism in the arc began about 37 million years ago ; however , most of the present-day Cascade volcanoes are less than 2,000,000 years old , and the highest peaks are less than 100,000 years old . Twelve volcanoes in the arc are over 10000 ft in elevation , and the two highest , Mount Rainier and Mount Shasta , exceed 14000 ft. By volume , the two largest Cascade volcanoes are the broad shields of Medicine Lake Volcano and Newberry Volcano , which are about 145 cumi and 108 cumi respectively . Mount Garibaldi and Glacier Peak are the only two Cascade volcanoes that are made exclusively of dacite .   Over the last 37 million years , the Cascade Arc has been erupting a chain of volcanoes along the Pacific Northwest . Several of the volcanoes in the arc are frequently active . The volcanoes of the Cascade Arc share some general characteristics , but each has its own unique geological traits and history . Lassen Peak in California , which last erupted in 1917 , is the southernmost historically active volcano in the arc , while Mount Meager in British Columbia , which erupted about 2,350 years ago , is generally considered the northernmost member of the arc . A few isolated volcanic centers northwest of Mount Meager such as the Silverthrone Caldera , which is a circular 20 km wide , deeply dissected caldera complex , may also be the product of Cascadia subduction because the igneous rocks andesite , basaltic andesite , dacite and rhyolite can also be found at these volcanoes as they are elsewhere along the subduction zone . At issue are the current estimates of plate configuration and rate of subduction , but based on the chemistry of these volcanoes , they are also subduction related and therefore part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc . The Cascade Volcanic Arc appears to be segmented ; the central portion of the arc is the most active and the northern end least active .   Lavas representing the earliest stage in the development of the Cascade Volcanic Arc mostly crop out south of the North Cascades proper , where"], [366, 'Stinking Bishop is a variety of pear bred near Dymock , England primarily for perry .   The official name of the pear is actually Moorcroft and Stinking Bishop is one of its many other names , including Malvern Pear , Choke Pear , and Choker .   It was posthumously named after the breeder , a Mr. Bishop , who allegedly had an ugly temperament . In a 2005 American National Public Radio interview , Charles Martell , the maker of Stinking Bishop cheese , related a story that Bishop got angry at his kettle one day for not heating fast enough and in retaliation shot it . This story , although possibly apocryphal , illustrates the sort of behaviour which earned Bishop his reputation for irascibility .'], [367, "The President of the United States of America ( POTUS ) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States . The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces .   The President of the United States is considered one of the world 's most powerful people , leading the world 's only contemporary superpower . The role includes being the commander-in-chief of the world 's most expensive military with the largest nuclear arsenal and leading the nation with the largest economy by real and nominal GDP . The office of the president holds significant hard and soft power both in the United States and abroad .   Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests the executive power of the United States in the president . The power includes execution of federal law , alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive , diplomatic , regulatory and judicial officers , and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the Senate . The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves , and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances . The president is largely responsible for dictating the legislative agenda of the party to which the president is enrolled . The president also directs the foreign and domestic policy of the United States . Since the founding of the United States , the power of the president and the federal government has grown substantially .   The president is indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a four-year term , and is one of only two nationally elected federal officers , the other being the Vice President of the United States . The Twenty-second Amendment , adopted in 1951 , prohibits anyone from ever being elected to the presidency for a third full term . It also prohibits a person from being elected to the presidency more than once if that person previously had served as president , or acting president , for more than two years of another person 's term as president . In all , 43 individuals have served 44 presidencies ( counting Cleveland 's two non-consecutive terms separately ) spanning 56 full four-year terms . On January 20 , 2009 , Barack Obama became the 44th and current president . On November 6 , 2012 , he was re-elected and is currently serving the 57th term . The next presidential election is scheduled to take place on November 8 , 2016 ; on January 20 , 2017 , the newly elected president will take office .   Origin   In 1776 , the Thirteen Colonies , acting through the Second Continental Congress , declared political independence from Great Britain during the American Revolution . The new states , though independent of each other as nation states , recognized the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British . Desiring to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy , Congress negotiated the Articles of Confederation to establish a weak alliance between the states . As a central authority , Congress under the Articles was without any legislative power ; it could make its own resolutions , determinations , and regulations , but not any laws , nor any taxes or local commercial regulations enforceable upon citizens . This institutional design reflected the conception of how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion : a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire . Out from under any monarchy , the states assigned some formerly royal prerogatives ( e.g. , making war , receiving ambassadors , etc . ) to Congress , while severally lodging the rest within their own respective state governments . Only after all the states agreed to a resolution settling competing western land claims did the Articles take effect on March 1 , 1781 , when Maryland became the final state to ratify them .   In 1783 , the Treaty of Paris secured independence for each of the former colonies . With peace at hand , the states each turned toward their own internal affairs . By 1786 , Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak , their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another , witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports , their Mediterranean commerce preyed upon by North African pirates , and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest . Civil and political unrest loomed .   Following the successful resolution of commercial"], [368, "Hrunting was a sword given to Beowulf by Unferth in the ancient Old English epic poem Beowulf . Beowulf used it in battle against Grendel 's Mother .   Beowulf is described receiving the sword in lines 1455-1458 :   `` And another item lent by Unferth  at that moment of need was of no small importance :  the brehon handed him a hilted weapon ,  a rare and ancient sword named Hrunting .  The iron blade with its ill-boding patterns  had been tempered in blood . It had never failed  the hand of anyone who hefted it in battle ,  anyone who had fought and faced the worst  in the gap of danger . This was not the first time  it had been called to perform heroic feats .   However , although the sword possessed great power and was claimed to have never failed anyone who used it , when Beowulf descended to the bottom of the lake to fight Grendel 's mother , the sword proved ineffective . As the `` fabulous powers of that heirloom failed , '' Beowulf was forced to discard it .   Hrunting 's significance   Swords have great significance in the war-centred Anglo-Saxon culture from which Beowulf arises . Therefore , emphasis is strongly placed on the exchange of weapons of war . Weapons such as swords circulated through Anglo-Saxon society as inheritance through family , birthed through the monsters , found under magic rocks , and as rewards between lords and their subjects . Occasionally such exchange was also seen between warriors . One example of a weapon as a gift is seen in the exchange of Hrunting . As Unferth passes his sword to Beowulf , he admits the loss of his glory , and his submission to this greater warrior . However , when Hrunting fails Beowulf in his battle against Grendel 's mother , it possibly reflects its previous owner , Unferth , who failed to defeat the hated Grendel . In addition , Beowulf ’ s defeat of Grendel prompts the Danish king Hrothgar to bestow upon him many gifts consisting of weapons ; this further emphasizes the importance of weaponry to such a society . Beowulf then passes on his rewards to his king Hygelac , thereby establishing his obligation to his king . Hrunting ’ s various meanings demonstrate that weapons of war can carry not only positive , but also negative , significance .   Symbolism of Hrunting   Unferth ’ s very act of giving Hrunting to Beowulf and the sword ’ s unexpected failure in the battle against Grendel ’ s mother bear much symbolism in the poem . Given that Unferth shows his dislike for Beowulf early in the story , Unferth ’ s choice to award Beowulf with Hrunting , which means “ thrusting , ” can be interpreted as a sign of peace and acceptance . In this light , the giving of the sword seems to be an indication of Unferth ’ s recognition of Beowulf as a capable and powerful warrior . On the other hand , the poem portrays Unferth as a sly and treacherous man . Furthermore , scholars even propose that Hrunting is “ the very sword with which [ Unferth ] slew his own kin. ” Ettlinger , Ellen ( 1943 ) . Beowulf , Unferth and Hrunting : An Interpretation in Man , Vol . 43 , ( Jan. – Feb. , 1943 ) , pp.11-17 . Date Accessed : March 30 , 2009. p. 10 It is possible then that Unferth 's motive in giving away his sword upon being confronted with the problem of Grendel 's mother could very well be to avoid going into battle . The passing of Hrunting from Unferth 's hand to Beowulf is therefore a reflection of Unferth 's treachery as he abandons his role as a warrior of Heorot . At first glance , Unferth 's sudden act of generosity towards Beowulf appears to have been done for noble reasons . However , what is known about Unferth and the sword 's inefficacy in battle strongly suggest that Unferth 's intentions are cowardly rather than noble - something reinforced by the similarly equivocal role played by the sword 's `` hafted '' counterpart in Grettis Saga .   Hrunting 's failure   The reason behind Hrunting 's failing against Grendel 's Mother has been a point of much scholarly debate . J.L . Rosier , in A Design for Treachery : The Unferth Intrigue , puts forth the contention that Unferth deliberately gave Beowulf a sword that he knew would fail , possibly for the"], [369, "The River Colne ( or ) is a small river that runs through Colchester , England . It is not a tributary of any other river , instead having an estuary that joins the sea near Brightlingsea .   Sources   The Colne 's two main tributaries start near the villages of Stambourne Green and Birdbrook in Essex . These converge in Great Yeldham , and then flow through Sible Hedingham , Halstead , Earls Colne , Colne Engaine , White Colne , Chappel and Ford Street before reaching Colchester .   In Colchester   The Colne Valley has a flood plain which spans approximately 300 metres by the time it enters Colchester . This area is used as pasture , as the river at this stage has no safeguards against it rising the two feet it needs to burst its banks , although it is split between two pasture areas in Spring Lane , Old Lexden . Roughly to the south of Colchester North Station , the river passes under a bridge and into a concrete-lined area that was used as an open-air bathing facility until the 1970s , and is now used by canoeists .   It then meanders under a road bridge at the bottom of North Hill , and tumbles down a weir used for discharge control at Middlemill , the site of a now-demolished mill . It forms the border of Colchester 's Castle Park and the cricket ground , and footbridges cross it to provide access from the town centre to residential areas on the north side of the flood plain , which occasionally floods should the river rise too much . The river encircles one side of a small lake , and then turns south-east , and then south , before falling over a large weir and becoming tidal .   After Colchester   Beyond this point , the river shows significant mud banks at low tide , and flows through the Hythe , past the University of Essex campus , and then through the villages of Rowhedge and Wivenhoe past the tidal barrier and down to Brightlingsea . Downstream from the barrier , the Colne is marked by navigation buoys .   Situation   The banks of the Colne frequently incorporate Second World War pillboxes , particularly close to navigable crossings .   From Castle Park to Wivenhoe Railway Station , National Cycle Network Route 51 roughly follows the course of the Colne . This is a mixture of tarmac-surfaced shared-use paths , a short tarmac/gravel-surfaced area and , once out of the urban area of Colchester , a hard dirt path on the north levee of the river that passes the Hythe and the university all the way to Wivenhoe .   The Hythe area of Colchester , through which the Colne flows , was , from Roman times , a small port that supplied the town . However , the river is no longer deep enough to support ships large enough to make this viable , and water trade is now non-existent . Victorian-era plans to dredge the river once more ultimately failed ."], [370, "A natural satellite or moon is a celestial body that orbits another celestial body of greater mass ( e.g . a planet , star , or dwarf planet ) , called its primary . For example , the Moon is a natural satellite of Earth , and Earth is a natural satellite of the Sun .   In the Solar System there are 173 known natural satellites which orbit within 6 planetary satellite systems . In addition , several other objects are known to have satellites , including three IAU-listed dwarf planets : Pluto , Haumea , and Eris . , over 200 minor-planet moons have been discovered . There are 76 known objects in the asteroid belt with satellites ( five with two each ) , four Jupiter trojans , 39 near-Earth objects ( two with two satellites each ) , and 14 Mars-crossers . There are also 84 known natural satellites of trans-Neptunian objects . Some 150 additional small bodies have been observed within the rings of Saturn , but only a few were tracked long enough to establish orbits . Planets around other stars are likely to have satellites as well , and although numerous candidates have been detected to date , none have yet been confirmed .   Of the inner planets , Mercury and Venus have no natural satellites ; Earth has one large natural satellite , known as the Moon ; and Mars has two tiny natural satellites , Phobos and Deimos .  The giant planets have extensive systems of natural satellites , including half a dozen comparable in size to Earth 's Moon : the four Galilean moons , Saturn 's Titan , and Neptune 's Triton . Saturn has an additional six mid-sized natural satellites massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium , and Uranus has five . It has been suggested that some satellites may potentially harbour life .   The Earth–Moon system is unique in that the ratio of the mass of the Moon to the mass of Earth is much greater than that of any other natural-satellite–planet ratio in the Solar System ( although there are minor-planet systems with even greater ratios , notably the Pluto–Charon system ) .   Among the identified dwarf planets , Ceres has no known natural satellites . Pluto has the relatively large natural satellite Charon and four smaller natural satellites ; Styx , Nix , Kerberos , and Hydra . Haumea has two natural satellites , and Eris and Makemake have one . The Pluto–Charon system is unusual in that the center of mass lies in open space between the two , a characteristic sometimes associated with a double-planet system .   Origin and orbital characteristics   The natural satellites orbiting relatively close to the planet on prograde , uninclined circular orbits ( regular satellites ) are generally thought to have been formed out of the same collapsing region of the protoplanetary disk that created its primary . In contrast , irregular satellites ( generally orbiting on distant , inclined , eccentric and/or retrograde orbits ) are thought to be captured asteroids possibly further fragmented by collisions . Most of the major natural satellites of the Solar System have regular orbits , while most of the small natural satellites have irregular orbits . The Moon and possibly Charon are exceptions among large bodies in that they are thought to have originated by the collision of two large proto-planetary objects ( see the giant impact hypothesis ) . The material that would have been placed in orbit around the central body is predicted to have reaccreted to form one or more orbiting natural satellites . As opposed to planetary-sized bodies , asteroid moons are thought to commonly form by this process . Triton is another exception ; although large and in a close , circular orbit , its motion is retrograde and it is thought to be a captured dwarf planet .   Tidal locking   Most regular moons ( natural satellites following relatively close and prograde orbits with small orbital inclination and eccentricity ) in the Solar System are tidally locked to their respective primaries , meaning that the same side of the natural satellite always faces its planet . The only known exception is Saturn 's natural satellite Hyperion , which rotates chaotically because of the gravitational influence of Titan .   In contrast , the outer natural satellites of the giants planet ( irregular satellites ) are too far away to have become locked . For example , Jupiter 's Himalia , Saturn 's Phoebe , and Neptune 's Nereid have rotation periods in the range of ten hours , whereas their orbital periods are hundreds of days .   Satellites"], [371, "The neck , nicor , nixie or nokken ( ; , nekker ; ; ; ; ) are shapeshifting water spirits in Germanic mythology and folklore who usually appeared in forms of other creatures .   Under a variety of names , they were common to the stories of all Germanic peoples , although they are perhaps best known from Scandinavian folklore . The related English knucker was generally depicted as a wyrm or dragon , although more recent versions depict the spirits in other forms . Their sex , bynames , and various transformations vary geographically . The German Nix and his Scandinavian counterparts were males . The German Nixe was a female river mermaid .   Names and etymology   The names are held to derive from Common Germanic * nikwus or * nikwis ( i ) , derived from PIE * neigw ( `` to wash '' ) . They are related to Sanskrit nḗnēkti , Greek νίζω nízō and νίπτω níptō , and Irish nigh ( all meaning to wash or be washed ) . The form neck appears in English and Swedish ( näck or nek , meaning `` nude '' ) . The Swedish form is derived from Old Swedish neker , which corresponds to Old Icelandic nykr ( gen. nykrs ) , and nykk in Norwegian Nynorsk . In Finnish , the word is näkki . In Old Danish , the form was nikke and in modern Danish and Norwegian Bokmål it is nøkk . The Icelandic nykur is a horselike creature . In Middle Low German , it was called necker and in Middle Dutch nicker ( c.f . also Nickel or Nikkel plus Kobolt ) . The Old High German form nihhus also meant `` crocodile '' , while the Old English nicor could mean both a `` water monster '' like those encountered by Beowulf , and a `` hippopotamus '' . The Norwegian Fossegrim and Swedish Strömkarlen are related figures sometimes seen as by-names for the same creature . The Scandinavian version can transform himself into a horse-like kelpie , and is called a Bäckahästen ( the `` brook horse '' ) , whilst the Welsh version is called the Ceffyl Dŵr ( the `` water horse '' ) .   England   In the English county of Sussex , there are said to dwell `` water-wyrms '' called knuckers . The Word knucker is derived from the Old English nicor . English folklore contains many creatures with similarities to the Nix or Näck . These Necks include Jenny Greenteeth , the Shellycoat , Peg Powler , the Bäckahästen-like Brag , and the Grindylow .   Scandinavia   Näck , Nøkk   The Scandinavian näcken , näkki , nøkk were male water spirits who played enchanted songs on the violin , luring women and children to drown in lakes or streams . However , not all of these spirits were necessarily malevolent ; in fact , many stories exist that indicate at the very least that nøkker were entirely harmless to their audience and attracted not only women and children , but men as well with their sweet songs . Stories also exist where in the Fossegrim agreed to live with a human who had fallen in love with him , but many of these stories ended with the nøkk returning to his home , usually a nearby waterfall or brook . ( Compare the legend of Llyn y Fan Fach in Wales . ) Nøkker are said to grow despondent if they do not have free , regular contact with a water source .   The Norwegian Fossegrim or Grim , Swedish strömkarl , is a related figure who , if properly approached , will teach a musician to play so adeptly `` that the trees dance and waterfalls stop at his music . ''   It is difficult to describe the actual appearance of the nix , as one of his central attributes was thought to be shapeshifting . Perhaps he did not have any true shape . He could show himself as a man playing the violin in brooks and waterfalls ( though often imagined as fair and naked today , in actual folklore he was more frequently wearing more or less elegant clothing ) but also could appear to be treasure or various floating objects or as an animal—most commonly in the form of a `` brook horse '' ( see below ) . The modern Scandinavian names are derived from an Old Norse nykr , meaning `` river horse . '' Thus , likely the brook horse preceded the personification of the nix as the `` man in the rapids '' . Fossegrim and"], [372, "An urn is a vase , often with a cover , that usually has a somehat narrowed neck above a rounded body and a footed pedestal . Describing a vessel as an `` urn '' , as opposed to a vase or other terms , generally reflects its use rather than any particular shape or origin . The term is especially often used for funerary urns , vessels used in burials , either to hold the cremated ashes or as grave-goods , but is used in many other contexts ; in catering large vessels for serving tea or coffee are often called `` tea-urns '' , even when they are metal cylinders of purely functional design . Large sculpted vases are often called urns , whether placed outdoors , in gardens or as architectural ornaments on buildings , or kept inside .   Cremation urns   Funerary urns ( also called cinerary urns and burial urns ) have been used by many civilizations . After a person died , survivors cremated the body and collected the ashes in an urn . Pottery urns , dating from about 7000 BC , have been found in an early Jiahu site in China , where a total of 32 burial urns are found , and another early finds are in Laoguantai , Shaanxi . There are about 700 burial urns unearthed over the Yangshao ( 5000–3000 BC ) areas and consisting more than 50 varieties of form and shape . The burial urns were used mainly for children , but also sporadically for adults .   The Urnfield culture ( c. 1300 BC – 750 BC ) , a late Bronze Age culture of central Europe , takes its name from its large cemeteries of urn burials . The discovery of a Bronze Age urn burial in Norfolk , England , prompted Sir Thomas Browne to describe the antiquities found . He expanded his study to survey burial and funerary customs , ancient and current , and published it as Hydriotaphia or Urn Burial ( 1658 ) .   In ancient Greece , cremation was usual , and the ashes typically placed in a painted Greek vase . In particular the lekythos , a shape of vase , was used for holding oil in funerary rituals . Romans placed the urns in a niche in a collective tomb called a columbarium ( literally , dovecote ) . The interior of a dovecote usually has niches to house doves . Cremation urns were also commonly used in early Anglo Saxon England , and in many Pre-Columbian cultures .   In some later European traditions , a king 's heart , and sometimes other organs , could be placed in one or more urns upon his death , as happened with King Otto of Bavaria in 1916 , and buried in a different place from the body , to symbolize a particlar affection for the place by the departed .   In the modern funeral industry , cremation urns of varying quality , elaborateness , and cost are offered , and urns are another source of potential profit for an industry concerned that a trend toward cremation might threaten profits from traditional burial ceremonies . Biodegradable urns are sometimes used for both human and animal burial . They are made from eco-friendly materials such as recycled or handmade paper , salt , cellulose or other natural products that are capable of decomposing back into natural elements , and sometimes include a seed intended to grow into a tree at the site of the burial .   Besides the traditional funeral or cremation ashes urns , it is also possible to keep a part of the ashes of the loved one or beloved pet in keepsake urns or ash jewelry . It is even possible to place the ashes of two people in so-called companion urns . [ http : //artisurn.com/pages/types-of-urns Source ] Cremation or funeral urns are made from a variety of materials such as wood , nature stone , ceramic , glass , or steel .   Scattering of ashes has become popular over recent decades . As a result , urns designed to scatter the ashes from have been developed . Some are eco-friendly , affordable and can be recycled after being used .   Figural urn   A Figural urn is a style of vase or larger container where the basic urn shape , of either a classic amphora or a crucible style , is ornamented with figures . These may be attached to the main body , forming handles or simply extraneous decorations , or may be shown in relief on the body itself .

The most colourful and complex character in the book , he continues to appear in popular culture .   Profile   In Treasure Island , Long John Silver is a cunning and opportunistic pirate who was quartermaster under the notorious Captain Flint . Long John Silver had a pet parrot called Captain Flint , often seen sitting on his shoulder where she would nibble on seeds . Silver claims to have served in the Royal Navy and lost his leg under `` the immortal Hawke '' . `` His left leg was cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch , which he managed with wonderful dexterity , hopping about upon it like a bird . He was very tall and strong , with a face as big as a ham – plain and pale , but intelligent and smiling . '' He claims to have been the only man whom Flint ever feared . Like many of Stevenson 's characters , there is more than a modicum of duality in the character ; ostensibly Silver is a hardworking and likeable seaman , and it is only as the plot unfolds that his villainous nature is gradually revealed . His relationship with Jim Hawkins , the novel 's protagonist and narrator , is interesting , as he serves as a mentor and eventually father-figure to Jim , creating much shock and emotion when it is discovered that he is in charge of the mutiny , and especially when Jim must confront and fight him later on . Although willing to change sides at any time to further his own interests , Silver has compensating virtues : he is wise enough to pay attention to money management , in contrast to the spendthrift ways of most of the pirates , and is physically courageous despite his disability ; for instance , when Flint 's cache is found to be empty , he coolly stands his ground against five grown men despite having only Jim , a boy in his teens , to back him .   When Silver escapes at the end of the novel , he takes `` three or four hundred guineas '' of the treasure with him , thus becoming one of only two former members of Captain Flint 's crew to get his hands on a portion of the recovered treasure ; a separate cache of bar silver is apparently left on the island . ( The repentant maroonee Ben Gunn is the other , but he spends all £1,000 in nineteen days . ) Jim 's own ambivalence towards Silver is reflected in the last chapter , when he speculates that the old pirate must have settled down in comfortable retirement : `` It is to be hoped so , I suppose , for his chances of comfort in another world are very small . ''   Stevenson 's portrayal of Silver has greatly influenced the modern iconography of the pirate . Silver has a parrot , named Captain Flint in mockery of his former captain , who generally perches on Silver 's shoulder , and is known to chatter pirate or seafaring phrases like `` Pieces of Eight '' , and `` Stand by to go about '' . Silver uses the parrot as another means of gaining Jim 's trust , by telling the boy all manner of exciting stories ( many of them likely fake ) about the parrot 's buccaneer history . 'Now that bird , ' Silver would say , 'is , may be , two hundred years old , Hawkins—they live forever mostly , and if anybody 's seen more wickedness it must be the devil himself . She 's sailed with England—the great Cap'n England , the pirate . She 's been at Madagascar , and at Malabar , and Surinam , and Providence , and Portobello ... She was at the boarding of the Viceroy of the Indies out of Goa , she was , and to look at her you would think she was a baby . ''   Silver is married to a woman of African descent , whom he trusts to manage his business affairs in his absence and to liquidate his Bristol assets when his actions make it impossible for him to go home . He confides in his fellow pirates , that he and his wife plan to rendezvous after the voyage to Skeleton Island is complete and Flint 's treasure is recovered , at which point Silver will retire to a life of luxury . Ironically"], [374, 'Uranium is a chemical element with symbol U and atomic number 92 . It is a silvery-white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table . A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons , of which 6 are valence electrons . Uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable ( with half-lives of the six naturally known isotopes , uranium-233 to uranium-238 , varying between 69 years and 4.5 billion years ) . The most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238 ( which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99 % ) and uranium-235 ( which has 143 neutrons ) . Uranium has the second highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements , lighter only than plutonium . Its density is about 70 % higher than that of lead , and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten . It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil , rock and water , and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite .   In nature , uranium is found as uranium-238 ( 99.2739–99.2752 % ) , uranium-235 ( 0.7198–0.7202 % ) , and a very small amount of uranium-234 ( 0.0050–0.0059 % ) . Uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle . The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years , making them useful in dating the age of the Earth .   Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties . Uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope . Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons , and is fertile , meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor . Another fissile isotope , uranium-233 , can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology . Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons ; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons . In sufficient concentration , these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction . This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors , and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons . Depleted uranium ( 238U ) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating . Uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass , producing lemon yellow to green colors . Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light . It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography .   The 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth , who named the new element after the planet Uranus . Eugène-Melchior Péligot was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel . Research by Otto Hahn , Lise Meitner , Enrico Fermi and others , such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in Little Boy , the first nuclear weapon used in war . An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239 . The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety . See Nuclear proliferation .   Characteristics   When refined , uranium is a silvery white , weakly radioactive metal . It has a Mohs hardness of 6 , sufficient to scratch glass and approximately equal to that of titanium , rhodium , manganese and niobium . It is malleable , ductile , slightly paramagnetic , strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor . Uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1 g/cm3 , denser than lead ( 11.3 g/cm3 ) , but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold ( 19.3 g/cm3 ) .   Uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metal elements ( with an exception of the noble gases ) and their compounds , with reactivity increasing with temperature . Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium , but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly . When finely divided , it can react with cold water ; in air , uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide . Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry .   Uranium-235 was the first isotope that was found to be fissile . Other naturally occurring isotopes are'], [375, "Mr Whoppit was the teddy bear mascot of Donald Campbell , the land and water speed record holder . Writing in his 2011 book , Donald Campbell : The Man Behind The Mask , journalist David Tremayne described Whoppit as Campbell 's `` magic talisman '' .   As was his father Sir Malcolm Campbell , Donald Campbell was highly superstitious . Both consulted spiritualist mediums and fortune tellers , Donald also placed his faith in a lucky mascot , Mr Whoppit . He refused to drive unless Whoppit was with him . One of his wife Tonia 's tasks was to hand Whoppit to him on entering the cockpit . Whoppit was noted in 2003 by reporter Frank Bennett as being part of the `` threesome '' arriving for the 1964 record run the others being Campbell himself , and his wife . Bennett remarked that the mascot was in the cockpit each time , along with other memorabilia .   Whoppit was with Campbell during his serious crash during a land-speed record attempt at the Bonneville Salt Flats in 1960 , driving the Proteus Bluebird .   Campbell was killed during a record attempt on Coniston in 1967 , while driving the jet hydroplane Bluebird K7 . His body was n't recovered , although Mr Whoppit floated free and was found almost immediately by Leo Villa . Campbell 's body was finally located and recovered in 2001 .   Campbell also named one of his dogs 'Whoppit ' . Another teddy bear mascot was found as a 'wife ' for Whoppit , named 'Mrs Whacko ' , who did not ride with Whoppit but stayed with Tonia and the pit crew .   Mr Whoppit 's origins   'Woppit ' first appeared as a cartoon strip 'The story of Woppit ' about a toy teddy bear , from the first issue of the comic Robin in 1953 . In 1956 , Merrythought manufactured a 9-inch tall Woppit bear wearing a red felt jacket and one of these was given to Donald by his close friend and manager Peter Barker.On joining the Bluebird team , Woppit acquired a miniature of their `` Bluebird '' patch sewn to his jacket , later followed by a one-piece flight suit . His name also changed slightly to 'Mr Whoppit ' . In 1959 , both Campbell and Mr Whoppit were photographed together in Robin .   In the late 1990s , Merrythought re-issued a limited production of 5,000 replicas of Mr Whoppit , with the original red jacket now sporting the Bluebird motif .   With Gina Campbell   In later years , Donald 's daughter Gina Campbell also adopted Whoppit as a mascot for her own water record-breaking attempts . These led to Whoppit 's third high-speed crash .   In 1995 she offered him for auction , together with other Campbell memorabilia . He was to sell for about £60,000 but failed to reach the reserve and so remained in her possession . The decision to auction off Mr Whoppit was a cause of acrimony between Gina Campbell and Donald 's widow Tonia Bern-Campbell , which re-surfaced again during the recovery of Bluebird in 2001 ."], [376, "William Buckland DD FRS ( 12 March 1784 – 14 August 1856 ) was an English theologian who became Dean of Westminster . He was also a geologist and palaeontologist , writing the first full account of a fossil dinosaur , which he named Megalosaurus . His work proving that Kirkdale Cave had been a prehistoric hyena den , for which he was awarded the Copley Medal , was praised as an example of how scientific analysis could reconstruct events from the distant past . He was a pioneer in the use of fossilised faeces , for which he coined the term coprolites , to reconstruct ancient ecosystems .   Buckland was a proponent of the Gap Theory that interpreted the biblical account of Genesis as referring to two separate episodes of creation separated by a lengthy period ; it emerged in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a way to reconcile the scriptural account with discoveries in geology that suggested the earth was very old . Early in his career he believed that he had found geological evidence of the biblical flood , but later became convinced that the glaciation theory of Louis Agassiz provided a better explanation , and he played an important role in promoting that theory in Great Britain .   Early life and university   Buckland was born at Axminster in DevonChisholm , 1911 and , as a child , would accompany his father , the Rector of Templeton and Trusham , on his walks where interest in road improvements led to collecting fossil shells , including ammonites , from the Jurassic lias rocks exposed in local quarries .   He was educated first at Blundell 's School , Tiverton , Devon , and then at Winchester College , from where in 1801 he won a scholarship to study for the ministry at Corpus Christi College , Oxford , also attending the lectures of John Kidd on mineralogy and chemistry , as well as developing an interest in geology and carrying out field research on strata , during vacations . Having taken his BA in 1804 , he went on to obtain his MA degree in 1808 . He then became a Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1809 , was ordained as a priest and continued to make frequent geological excursions , on horseback , to various parts of England , Scotland , Ireland and Wales . In 1813 , he was appointed reader in mineralogy , in succession to John Kidd , giving lively and popular lectures with increasing emphasis on geology and palaeontology . As ( unofficial ) curator of the Ashmolean Museum , he built up collections , touring Europe and coming into contact with scientists including Georges Cuvier .   Rejection of flood geology and Kirkdale Cave   In 1818 , Buckland was elected a fellow of the Royal Society . That year he persuaded the Prince Regent to endow an additional Readership , this time in Geology and he became the first holder of the new appointment , delivering his inaugural address on 15 May 1819 . This was published in 1820 as Vindiciæ Geologiæ ; or the Connexion of Geology with Religion explained , both justifying the new science of geology and reconciling geological evidence with the biblical accounts of creation and Noah 's Flood . At a time when others were coming under the opposing influence of James Hutton 's theory of uniformitarianism , Buckland developed a new hypothesis that the word `` beginning '' in Genesis meant an undefined period between the origin of the earth and the creation of its current inhabitants , during which a long series of extinctions and successive creations of new kinds of plants and animals had occurred . Thus , his catastrophism theory incorporated a version of Old Earth creationism or Gap creationism . Buckland believed in a global deluge during the time of Noah but was not a supporter of flood geology as he believed that only a small amount of the strata could have been formed in the single year occupied by the deluge .   From his investigations of fossil bones at Kirkdale Cave , in Yorkshire , he concluded that the cave had actually been inhabited by hyaenas in antediluvian times , and that the fossils were the remains of these hyaenas and the animals they had eaten , rather than being remains of animals that had perished in the Flood and then carried from the tropics by the surging waters , as he and others had at first thought . In 1822 he wrote :   It must already appear probable , from the facts above described , particularly from the comminuted state and apparently gnawed"], [377, "74 ( seventy-four ) is the natural number following 73 and preceding 75 .

It is the world 's sixth-largest country by total area . Neighbouring countries include Papua New Guinea , Indonesia and East Timor to the north ; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east ; and New Zealand to the south-east .   For about 50,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century , Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians ,  who spoke languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups . After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606 , Australia 's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788 . The population grew steadily in subsequent decades ; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies were established . On 1 January 1901 , the six colonies federated , forming the Commonwealth of Australia . Since federation , Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories . The population of 24 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast .   Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world , with the world 's 12th-largest economy . In 2014 Australia had the world 's fifth-highest per capita income . Australia 's military expenditure is the world 's 13th-largest . With the second-highest human development index globally , Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance , such as quality of life , health , education , economic freedom , and the protection of civil liberties and political rights . Australia is a member of the United Nations , G20 , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , World Trade Organization , Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , and the Pacific Islands Forum .   Name   The name Australia ( pronounced in Australian English ) is derived from the Latin Terra Australis ( `` southern land '' ) a name used for putative lands in the southern hemisphere since ancient times . The earliest recorded use of the word Australia in English was in 1625 in `` A note of Australia del Espíritu Santo , written by Sir Richard Hakluyt '' , published by Samuel Purchas in Hakluytus Posthumus , a corruption of the original Spanish name `` Austrialia del Espíritu Santo '' ( Southern Land of the Holy Spirit ) for an island in Vanuatu . The Dutch adjectival form Australische was used in a Dutch book in Batavia ( Jakarta ) in 1638 , to refer to the newly discovered lands to the south .  The first time that the name Australia appears to have been officially used was in a despatch to Lord Bathurst of 4 April 1817 in which Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledges the receipt of Matthew Flinders ' charts of Australia . On 12 December 1817 , Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted . In 1824 , the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia .   History   Prehistory   Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago , possibly with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea-crossings from what is now Southeast Asia . These first inhabitants may have been ancestors of modern Indigenous Australians . At the time of European settlement in the late 18th century , most Indigenous Australians were hunter-gatherers , with a complex oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime . The Torres Strait Islanders , ethnically Melanesian , were originally horticulturists and hunter-gatherers . The northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically by fishermen from Maritime Southeast Asia .   European arrival   The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland , and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent , are attributed to the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon . He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606 , and made landfall on 26 February at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York.Davison , Hirst and Macintyre , p. 233 . The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent `` New Holland '' during the 17th"], [379, "Samuel Langhorne Clemens ( November 30 , 1835 – April 21 , 1910 ) , better known by his pen name Mark Twain , was an American writer . Among his novels are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ( 1876 ) and its sequel , Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ( 1885 ) , the latter often called `` The Great American Novel '' .   Twain was raised in Hannibal , Missouri , which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn . After an apprenticeship with a printer , Twain worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to the newspaper of his older brother , Orion Clemens . He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada . He referred humorously to his lack of success at mining , turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise . In 1865 , his humorous story , `` The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County '' , was published , based on a story he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp , California , where he had spent some time as a miner . The short story brought international attention , and was even translated into classic Greek . His wit and satire , in prose and in speech , earned praise from critics and peers , and he was a friend to presidents , artists , industrialists , and European royalty .   Though Twain earned a great deal of money from his writings and lectures , he invested in ventures that lost a great deal of money , notably the Paige Compositor , a mechanical typesetter , which failed because of its complexity and imprecision . In the wake of these financial setbacks , he filed for protection from his creditors via bankruptcy , and with the help of Henry Huttleston Rogers eventually overcame his financial troubles . Twain chose to pay all his pre-bankruptcy creditors in full , though he had no legal responsibility to do so .   Twain was born shortly after a visit by Halley 's Comet , and he predicted that he would `` go out with it '' , too . He died the day after the comet returned . He was lauded as the `` greatest American humorist of his age '' , and William Faulkner called Twain `` the father of American literature '' .   Biography   Early life   Samuel Langhorne Clemens was born in Florida , Missouri , on November 30 , 1835 . He was the son of Jane ( née Lampton ; 1803–1890 ) , a native of Kentucky , and John Marshall Clemens ( 1798–1847 ) , a Virginian . His parents met when his father moved to Missouri and were married in 1823 . Twain was the sixth of seven children , but only three of his siblings survived childhood : Orion ( 1825–1897 ) ; Henry ( 1838–1858 ) ; and Pamela ( 1827–1904 ) . His sister Margaret ( 1833–1839 ) died when he was three , and his brother Benjamin ( 1832–1842 ) died three years later . Another brother , Pleasant ( 1828–1829 ) , died at six months . Twain was born two weeks after the closest approach to Earth of Halley 's Comet . His ancestors were of Scots-Irish , English , and Cornish extraction .   When he was four , Twain 's family moved to Hannibal , Missouri , a port town on the Mississippi River that inspired the fictional town of St. Petersburg in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . Slavery , then legal in Missouri , was a theme Twain would explore in these writings .   In 1847 , when Twain was 11 , his father , by then an attorney and judge , died of pneumonia . The next year Twain left school after the fifth grade to become a printer 's apprentice . In 1851 , he began working as a typesetter and contributor of articles and humorous sketches for the Hannibal Journal , a newspaper Orion owned .

He joined the newly formed International Typographical Union , the printers union , and educated himself in public libraries in the evenings , finding wider information than at a conventional school .

There is a blue canton in the upper hoist-side corner bearing a white cross ; the cross symbolises Eastern Orthodox Christianity , the established religion of the Greek people of Greece and Cyprus . According to popular tradition , the nine stripes represent the nine syllables of the phrase `` Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος '' ( `` Freedom or Death '' ) , the five blue stripes for the syllables `` Έλευθερία '' and the four white stripes `` ή Θάνατος '' . The nine stripes are also said to represent the letters of the word `` freedom '' ( Greek : Ελευθερία ) . There is also a different theory , that the nine stripes symbolise the nine Muses , the goddesses of art and civilisation ( nine has traditionally been one of the numbers of reference for the Greeks ) . The official flag ratio is 2:3 . [ http : //www.presidency.gr/index.php ? option  com_content & viewarticle & id  3 & Itemid6 & lang  en The Flag , from the site of the Presidency of the Hellenic Republic ]   The blazon of the flag is Azure , four bars Argent ; on a canton of the field a Greek cross throughout of the second . The shade of blue used in the flag has varied throughout its history , from light blue to dark blue , the latter being increasingly used since the late 1960s .   The above patterns were officially adopted by the First National Assembly at Epidaurus on 13 January 1822 . Blue and white have many interpretations , symbolising the colours of the famed Greek sky and sea ( combined with the white clouds and waves ) , traditional colours of Greek clothes in the islands and the mainland , etc .   History   The origins of today 's national flag with its cross-and-stripe pattern are a matter of debate . Every part of it , including the blue and white colours ( see below ) , the cross , as well as the stripe arrangement can be connected to very old historical elements ; however it is difficult to establish `` continuity '' , especially as there is no record of the exact reasoning behind its official adoption in early 1822 .   It has been suggested by some Greek historians that the current flag derived from an older design , the virtually identical flag of the powerful Cretan Kallergis family . This flag was based on their coat of arms , whose pattern is supposed to be derived from the standards of their claimed ancestor , Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas ( 963–969 AD ) . This pattern ( according to not easily verifiable descriptions ) included nine stripes of alternating blue and white , as well as a cross , assumed to be placed on the upper left N.

However , in such cases of flags derived from much older designs , it is very difficult to prove or trace original influences .   Antiquity and the Byzantine Empire   Flags as they are known today did not exist in Antiquity . Instead , a variety of emblems and symbols ( semeion , pl . semeia ) were used to denote each state and were for example painted on the hoplite shields . The closest analogue to a modern flag were the vexillum-like banners used by ancient Greek armies , such as the so-called phoinikis , a cloth of deep red , suspended from the top of a staff or spear . It is not known to have carried any device or decoration though .   The Byzantines , like the Romans before them , used a variety of flags and banners , primarily to denote different military units . These were generally square or rectangular , with a number of streamers attached . Most prominent among the early Byzantine flags was the labarum"], [381, "Swimming is an individual or team sport and activity . Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports , with events in butterfly , backstroke , breaststroke , freestyle , and individual medley . In addition to these individual events , Olympic swimmers also participate in relays . Swimmers can also compete in open-water events ( i.e . swimming in the Ocean ) .   History   Evidence of recreational swimming in prehistoric times has been found , with the earliest evidence dating to Stone Age paintings from around 10000 years ago . Written references date from 2000 BC , with some of the earliest references to swimming including the Iliad , the Odyssey , the Bible , Beowulf , the Quran and others . In 1538 , Nikolaus Wynmann , a German professor of languages , wrote the first swimming book , The Swimmer or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming ( Der Schwimmer oder ein Zweigespräch über die Schwimmkunst ) .   Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England . In 1828 , the first indoor swimming pool , St George 's Baths was opened to the public . By 1837 , the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools , built around London . The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880 , when the first national governing body , the Amateur Swimming Association , was formed , there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country .   In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming competition in London introduced the front crawl to a Western audience . Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from some South American natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873 , winning a local competition in England . His stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today .   Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel ( between England and France ) , in 1875 . Using the breaststroke technique , he swam the channel in 21 hours and 45 minutes . His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years , until T.W . Burgess made the crossing in 1911 .   Other European countries also established swimming federations ; Germany in 1882 , France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896 . The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna . The world 's first women 's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892 .   Men 's swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens . In 1902 , the Australian Richmond Cavill introduced the front crawl to the Western world . In 1908 , the world swimming association , Fédération Internationale de Natation ( FINA ) , was formed . Women 's swimming was introduced into the Olympics in 1912 . Butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was at first a variant of breaststroke , until it was accepted as a separate style in 1952 .   Competitive swimming   Competitive swimming became popular in the 19th century . The goal of competitive swimming is to break personal or world records while beating competitors in any given event . Swimming in competition should create the least resistance in order to obtain maximum speed . However , some professional swimmers who do not hold a national or world ranking are considered the best in regard to their technical skills . Typically , an athlete goes through a cycle of training in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the cycle , and then the workload is decreased in the final stage as the swimmer approaches competition .   The practice of reducing exercise in the days just before an important competition is called tapering . A final stage is often referred to as `` shave and taper '' : the swimmer shaves off all exposed hair for the sake of reducing drag and having a sleeker and more hydrodynamic feel in the water . Additionally , the `` shave and taper '' method refers to the removal of the top layer of `` dead skin '' , which exposes the newer and richer skin underneath .   Swimming is an event at the Summer Olympic Games , where male and female athletes compete in 16 of the recognized events each . Olympic events are held in a 50-meter pool , called a long course pool .   There are forty officially recognized individual swimming events in the pool ; however the International Olympic Committee only"], [382, "Anouk Aimée ( ; born 27 April 1932 ) is a French film actress , who has appeared in 70 films since 1947 , having begun her film career at age 14 .

It tells the story of the overprotective clownfish named Marlin who , along with a regal blue tang named Dory , searches for his abducted son Nemo all the way to Sydney Harbour . Along the way , Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself .   Finding Nemo was released on May 30 , 2003 , and has received universal critical acclaim . The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature , and was nominated in three more categories , including Best Original Screenplay . Finding Nemo became the highest-grossing animated film at the time and was the second highest-grossing film of 2003 , earning a total of $ 867 million worldwide by the end of its initial theatrical run .   The film is the best-selling DVD title of all time , with over 40 million copies sold , and was the highest-grossing G-rated film of all time before Pixar 's own Toy Story 3 overtook it . The film was re-released in 3D in 2012 . In 2008 , the American Film Institute named it the 10th greatest animated film ever made as part of their 10 Top 10 lists . A sequel , Finding Dory , was released on June 17 , 2016 .   Plot   Two ocellaris clownfish , Marlin and his wife Coral , admire their new home in the Great Barrier Reef and their clutch of eggs when a barracuda attacks , knocking Marlin unconscious . He wakes up to find out that Coral and all but one of the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda . Marlin names this last egg Nemo , a name that Coral liked .   Nemo develops a smaller right fin as a result of damage to his egg during the attack , which limits his swimming ability . Worried about Nemo 's safety , Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip . Nemo sneaks away from the reef and is captured by scuba divers . As the boat departs , a diver accidentally knocks his diving mask overboard . While attempting to save Nemo , Marlin meets Dory , a good-hearted and optimistic regal blue tang with short-term memory loss . Marlin and Dory meet three sharks – Bruce , Anchor and Chum – who claim to be vegetarians . Marlin discovers the diver 's mask and notices an address written on it . When he argues with Dory and accidentally gives her a nosebleed , the blood scent causes Bruce to enter an uncontrollable feeding frenzy .

Most events since the inception in 1978 were from Paris , France , to Dakar , Senegal , but due to security threats in Mauritania , which led to the cancellation of the 2008 rally , races since 2009 have been held in South America . The race is open to amateur and professional entries , amateurs typically making up about eighty percent of the participants .   The race is an off-road endurance event . The terrain that the competitors traverse is much tougher than that used in conventional rallying , and the vehicles used are true off-road vehicles rather than modified on-road vehicles . Most of the competitive special sections are off-road , crossing dunes , mud , camel grass , rocks , and erg among others . The distances of each stage covered vary from short distances up to 800 - per day .   History   The race originated in December 1978 , a year after Thierry Sabine got lost in the Ténéré desert whilst competing in the Abidjan-Nice rally and decided that the desert would be a good location for a regular rally . 182 vehicles took the start of the inaugural rally in Paris , with 74 surviving the trip to the Senegalese capital of Dakar . Cyril Neveu holds the distinction of being the event 's first winner , riding a Yamaha motorcycle . The event rapidly grew in popularity , with 216 vehicles taking the start in 1980 and 291 in 1981 . Neveu won the event for a second time in 1980 , Hubert Auriol taking honours in 1981 for BMW . By this stage , the rally had already begun to attract the participation of famous names from elsewhere in motorsport , such as Henri Pescarolo and Jacky Ickx .   Now boasting 382 competitors , more than double the amount that took the start in 1979 , Neveu won the event for a third time in 1982 , this time riding a Honda motorcycle , while victory in the car class went to the Marreau brothers , driving a privately entered Renault 20 , whose buccaneering exploits seemed to perfectly capture the spirit of the early years of the rally . Auriol captured his second bikes class victory in 1983 , the first year that Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi competed in the rally , beginning an association that would last all the way until 2009 .   At the behest of 1983 car class winner Jacky Ickx , Porsche entered the Dakar in 1984 , with the total number of entries now at 427 . The German marque won the event at their first attempt courtesy of René Metge , who had previously won in the car category in 1981 , whilst Ickx finished sixth . Gaston Rahier meanwhile continued BMW 's success in the motorcycle category with back-to-back wins in 1984 and 1985 , the year of Mitsubishi 's first victory of 12 in the car category , Patrick Zaniroli taking the spoils . The 1986 event , won by Metge and Neveu , was marred by the death of event founder Sabine in a helicopter crash , his father Gilbert taking over organisation of the rally .   Peugeot-Citroën domination   The 1987 rally marked the start of an era of increased official factory participation in the car category , as French manufacturer Peugeot arrived and won the event with former World Rally champion Ari Vatanen . The 1987 event was also notable for a ferocious head-to-head duel between Neveu and Auriol in the motorcycle category , the former taking his fifth victory after Auriol was forced to drop out of the rally after breaking both ankles in a fall . The 1988 event reached its zenith in terms of entry numbers , with 603 starters . Vatanen 's title defence was derailed when his Peugeot was stolen from the service area at Bamako . Though it was later found , Vatanen was subsequently disqualified from the event , victory instead going to compatriot and teammate Juha Kankkunen .   Peugeot and Vatanen returned to winning ways in 1989 and 1990 , the latter marking Peugeot 's final year of rally competition before switching to the World Sportscar Championship . Sister brand Citroën took Peugeot 's place , Vatanen taking a third consecutive victory in 1991 . The 1991 event also saw Stéphane Peterhansel take his first title in the motorcycle category with Yamaha , marking the beginning of an era of domination by the Frenchman .

It is located in the English Channel , about 4 mi off the coast of Hampshire , separated from mainland Great Britain by the Solent . The island has several resorts that have been holiday destinations since Victorian times .   Until 1995 , like Jersey and Guernsey , the island had a Governor .   Home to the poets Swinburne and Tennyson and to Queen Victoria , who built her much-loved summer residence and final home Osborne House at East Cowes , the island has a maritime and industrial tradition including boat building , sail making , the manufacture of flying boats , the world 's first hovercraft , and the testing and development of Britain 's space rockets . The Isle hosts annual festivals including the Bestival and the Isle of Wight Festival , which , in 1970 , was the largest rock music event ever held . The island has well-conserved wildlife and some of the richest cliffs and quarries for dinosaur fossils in Europe .   The Isle of Wight was owned by a Norman family until 1293 and was earlier a kingdom in its own right . It was part of Hampshire until 1890 when it became an independent administrative county . It shared a Lord Lieutenant with Hampshire until 1974 , when it was reconstituted as a non-metropolitan ceremonial county , giving it its own Lord Lieutenant . Apart from a shared police force , there is now no formal administrative link between the Isle of Wight and Hampshire . In the 1970s , there was a political movement seeking the status of Crown Dependency .   The quickest public transport link to the mainland is to and from Southsea ( Portsmouth ) by hovercraft , while five ferry services shuttle across the Solent from Southampton , Lymington and Portsmouth .   History   Neolithic   There are theories that , during the Neolithic era , Bouldnor was a busy seaport that supported trade with the Middle East , as wheat was present there 8,000 years ago , hundreds of years before wheat was grown anywhere in Europe .   Bronze and Iron Age   The Isle of Wight is first mentioned in writing in Geography by Ptolemy . Bronze Age Britain had large reserves of tin in the areas of Cornwall and Devon and tin is necessary to smelt bronze . At that time the sea level was much lower and carts of tin were brought across the Solent at low tide for export , possibly on the Ferriby Boats . Anthony Snodgrass suggests that a shortage of tin , as a part of the Bronze Age Collapse and trade disruptions in the Mediterranean around 1300 BC , forced metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze . During Iron Age Britain , the Late Iron Age , the Isle of Wight would appear to have been occupied by the Celtic tribe , the Durotriges - as attested by finds of their coins , for example , the South Wight Hoard , and the Shalfleet Hoard . South eastern Britain experienced significant Continental immigration that is reflected in the genetic makeup of the current residents . As the Iron Age began the value of tin likely dropped sharply and this likely greatly changed the economy of the Isle of Wight . Trade however continued as evidenced by the remarkable local abundance of European Iron Age coins .   Roman period   Caesar reported that the Belgae took the Isle of Wight about 85 BC and named it Ictus ( or Vectis ) . The Roman historian Suetonius mentions that the entire island was captured by the commander Vespasian , who later became emperor .   The remains of at least five Roman villas have been found on the island , including one near Gurnard which is submerged . First century exports were principally hides , slaves , hunting dogs , grain , cattle , silver , gold , and iron . Ferriby Boats and later Blackfriars Ships likely were important to the local economy .   Jutish and Saxon era   In or about the 6th Century , the island became the Jutish kingdom of Wihtwara . Its first rulers were said to be Wihtgar ( who may have been fictitious ) and Stuf . In 661 when it was invaded by Wulfhere of Mercia and forcibly converted to Christianity . When he left for Mercia the islanders reverted to paganism .   In 685 it was invaded by Cædwalla of Wessex and can be considered to have become part of"], [386, "Louisa May Alcott ( ; November 29 , 1832 – March 6 , 1888 ) was an American novelist and poet best known as the author of the novel Little Women ( 1868 ) and its sequels Little Men ( 1871 ) and Jo 's Boys ( 1886 ) . Raised by her transcendentalist parents , Abigail May and Amos Bronson Alcott in New England , she grew up among many of the well-known intellectuals of the day such as Ralph Waldo Emerson , Nathaniel Hawthorne , and Henry David Thoreau .   Nevertheless , her family suffered severe financial difficulties and Alcott worked to help support the family from an early age . She began to receive critical success for her writing in the 1860s . Early in her career , she sometimes used the pen name A. M. Barnard and under it wrote novels for young adults .   Published in 1868 , Little Women is set in the Alcott family home , Hillside , later called the Wayside , in Concord , Massachusetts and is loosely based on Alcott 's childhood experiences with her three sisters . The novel was very well received and is still a popular children 's novel today , filmed several times . Alcott was an abolitionist and a feminist and remained unmarried throughout her life . She died in Boston on March 6 , 1888 . Henry James called her `` The novelist of children ... the Thackeray , the Trollope , of the nursery and the schoolroom . ''   Early life   Louisa May Alcott was born on November 29 , 1832 , in Germantown , which is now part of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , on her father 's 33rd birthday . She was the daughter of transcendentalist and educator Amos Bronson Alcott and social worker Abby May and the second of four daughters : Anna Bronson Alcott was the eldest ; Elizabeth Sewall Alcott and Abigail May Alcott were the two youngest . The family moved to Boston in 1834 , where Alcott 's father established an experimental school and joined the Transcendental Club with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau . Bronson Alcott 's opinions on education and tough views on child-rearing shaped young Alcott 's mind with a desire to achieve perfection , a goal of the transcendentalists . His attitudes towards Alcott 's wild and independent behavior , and his inability to provide for his family , created conflict between Bronson Alcott and his wife and daughters .   In 1840 , after several setbacks with the school , the Alcott family moved to a cottage on 2 acre of land , situated along the Sudbury River in Concord , Massachusetts . The three years they spent at the rented Hosmer Cottage were described as idyllic . By 1843 , the Alcott family moved , along with six other members of the Consociate Family , to the Utopian Fruitlands community for a brief interval in 1843–1844 . After the collapse of the Utopian Fruitlands , they moved on to rented rooms and finally , with Abigail May Alcott 's inheritance and financial help from Emerson , they purchased a homestead in Concord . They moved into the home they named `` Hillside '' on April 1 , 1845 .   Alcott 's early education included lessons from the naturalist Henry David Thoreau , but she received the majority of her schooling from her father , who was strict and believed in `` the sweetness of self-denial '' . She also received some instruction from writers and educators such as Ralph Waldo Emerson , Nathaniel Hawthorne , and Margaret Fuller , all of whom were family friends . She later described these early years in a newspaper sketch entitled `` Transcendental Wild Oats '' . The sketch was reprinted in the volume Silver Pitchers ( 1876 ) , which relates the family 's experiment in `` plain living and high thinking '' at Fruitlands .   Poverty made it necessary for Alcott to go to work at an early age as a teacher , seamstress , governess , domestic helper , and writer . Her sisters also supported the family , working as seamstresses , while their mother took on social work among the Irish immigrants . Only the youngest , May , was able to attend public school . Due to all of these pressures , writing became a creative and emotional outlet for Alcott . Her first book was Flower Fables ( 1849 ) , a selection of tales originally written for Ellen Emerson , daughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson .   In 1847 , she and her family served as station masters on the Underground"], [387, "Queequeg is a fictional character in the 1851 novel Moby-Dick by American author Herman Melville . The son of a South Sea chieftain who left home to explore the world , Queequeg is the first principal character encountered by the narrator , Ishmael . The quick friendship and relationship of equality between the tattooed cannibal and the white sailor shows Melville 's basic theme of shipboard democracy and racial diversity . Once aboard the whaling ship Pequod Queequeg becomes the harpooner for the mate Starbuck . At the end of the novel he `` casts the runes '' , which say he will die . He therefore builds a coffin and refuses to eat or drink , but ultimately decides to stay alive and then recovers . The coffin is later converted to a lifebuoy after the ship 's original one is lost . When Moby-Dick sinks the ship , Ishmael survives by clinging to it until another ship arrives to pick him up .   Description   Queequeg is a native of a fictional island in the South Pacific Ocean named Kokovoko . The island is the home to his primitive tribe , who practice cannibalism , in particular devouring the flesh of enemies slain in battle . Queequeg claims that the only case of indigestion he has suffered was after a feast in which 50 slain enemies were eaten . He displays no shame regarding the practice , describing his people in a matter-of-fact fashion . In port he prefers a diet of rare red meat , but will settle for whatever is on the menu , such as clam chowder—which is described as `` his favorite fishing food '' .   Although the son of a chief , he chose to leave his island out of curiosity to see more of the world and to experience and evaluate the civilization of the Christian world . At first rejected by the whaler that landed on his island , he skillfully jumped from a canoe and clamped to the side of the boat as it was leaving for the open sea , at which point the captain relented . At the opening of the novel , he is in the port of New Bedford , Massachusetts , having returned from a whaling voyage . Queequeg and Ishmael first meet when Queequeg returns late to the inn where he is staying , not knowing that Ishmael has been booked into the same room with him . Although Queequeg initially threatens to kill Ishmael , and Ishmael initially is afraid of this cannibal , but soon decides `` Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian . '' Upon waking next morning about daylight , Ishmael finds Queequeg 's arm thrown over him in the `` most loving and affectionate manner . You had almost thought I had been his wife . '' Ishmael convinces Queequeg to ship on another whaling expedition with him . At the time of the novel , he has been away from his home island for many years , so long that it is possible that his father is dead and that he would become the chief if he returned .   Queequeg practices a form of animism using a small idol named Yojo , for whom he builds small ceremonial fires . As part of his religion , he practices a prolonged period of fasting and silence ( which Ishmael calls his `` Ramadan '' ) , at one time locking himself in his room in Nantucket . Even after Ishmael enters the room , he keeps his fast and silence without acknowledging the presence of others . Nevertheless he spontaneously attends a Christian sermon of Father Mapple in New Bedford , although he slips out before the end .   He is unflappable and extremely easy-going among white society , never grudging an insult . He immediately takes to Ishmael and decides ( based on advice from his idol ) that Ishmael should decide on the ship for both of them together .   He is an extraordinary harpooner , impressing the money-tight owners of the Pequod so much that they immediately offer him a 90th lay ( of the ship 's profit ) in exchange for his signing on with the crew . By contrast , Ishmael ( who has experience in the merchant marine but none as a whaler ) is initially offered a 777th lay but eventually secures a 300th . In port , Queequeg carries his sharpened harpoon with him at all times , unless prevented from doing so .

The club 's limited overs team is called Lancashire Lightning .   Founded in 1864 as a successor to Manchester Cricket Club , Lancashire have played at Old Trafford since then and has had major status from inception : i.e. , classified as an unofficial first-class team by substantial sources from 1865 ( first match ) to 1894 ; classified as an official first-class team from 1895 by Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) and the County Championship clubs ; classified as a List A team since the beginning of limited overs cricket in 1963 ; and classified as a major Twenty20 team since 2003 .   Lancashire was widely recognised as the unofficial Champion County four times between 1879 and 1889 . When the County Championship was officially founded in December 1889 , Lancashire was one of eight clubs to feature in the competition ’ s first season in 1890 . In 1895 , Archie MacLaren scored 424 in an innings for Lancashire , which remains the highest score by an Englishman in first-class cricket . Lancashire won their first two County Championship titles in 1897 and 1904 . Between 1926 and 1934 , Lancashire won the County Championship five times . In 1950 , they shared the title with Surrey . Cyril Washbrook became Lancashire ’ s first professional captain in 1954 . Lancashire next won the County Championship in 2011 .   Johnny Briggs , whose career lasted from 1879 to 1900 , was the first player to score 10,000 runs and take 1,000 wickets for Lancashire . Ernest Tyldesley , younger brother of Johnny Tyldesley , is the club ’ s leading run-scorer with 34,222 runs in 573 matches for Lancashire between 1909 and 1936 . Fast bowler Brian Statham took a club record 1,816 wickets in 430 first-class matches between 1950 and 1968 .   The Lancashire side of the late 1960s and early 1970s , which was captained by Jack Bond and featured the West Indian batsman Clive Lloyd , was successful in limited overs cricket , winning the Sunday League in 1969 and 1970 and the Gillette Cup four times between 1970 and 1975 . Lancashire won the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1984 , three times between 1990 and 1996 , and the Sunday League in 1989 , 1998 and 1999 . The County Championship was restructured in 2000 with Lancashire in the first division . Since then they have been relegated three times , and each time were promoted the following season .

On 23–25 July 1849 , the Sheffield and Manchester clubs played each other at Hyde Park in Sheffield but the fixture was called “ Yorkshire versus Lancashire ” . It was the first match to involve a team using Lancashire as its name and is generally reckoned to have been the first `` Roses Match '' . Yorkshire won by five wickets .

The character first appeared on-screen on 9 October 2001 in episode `` Rogue Males '' - series 4 , episode 1 of the programme . Ric is the longest serving main character in the show , after the departure of Chrissie Williams on 19 November 2013 . He has currently played the role of Ric for almost 15 years .   Development   Discussing the storyline which saw Ric 's oldest son Leo die from a heroin overdose , Quarshie said ; `` I do n't think his death is a shock to Ric as he almost expected it . It 's devastating for him , but in true Ric style he holds everything in and throws himself into work . The consequences of the tragedy are felt later down the line . '' He drew on Ric 's troubled relationship with his own father to explain his distant relationship with his children , assessing ; `` Ric had a domineering and violent father . He swore he 'd never be that controlling with his own kids and as a result he was too hands-off . ''   In July 2010 , Quarshie revealed that Ric would be diagnosed with inoperable cancer , explaining : It 's asymptomatic - you do n't know you 've got it until it 's spread ... It 's so far gone , what 's the point in having chemotherapy ? '' He stated that following the diagnosis , Ric would become close to Annalese Carson , the estranged wife of his colleague Michael Spence .   As a long-standing cast member , Quarshie has been granted leave to pursue other projects including directing an episode of Holby City . Series producer Simon Harper has stated that the actor is allowed to ensure the character remains in the show for a longer tenure . The character remained off-screen for several months during 2015 and returned on 29 December 2015 , where he was appointed clinical lead on Keller ward .   Storylines   Ric arrived at Holby City Hospital in episode `` Rogue Males '' as a General Surgical Consultant . It was revealed in the show 's seventh series that he originated from Ghana , where his brother Kumi runs a hospital . He has been married five times - twice to Critical Care Consultant Lola Griffin - and has had several romances during his time on the show , including engagement to Senior House Officer Sam Kennedy , long term flirtation with former flame Diane Lloyd , and a brief marriage to Registrar Thandie Griffin . Diane and Ric got even more close in Ghana , while Keller ward was downsized and Diane hoped Ric would come back to Holby . He refused but eventually moved back . He had to put Diane under supervision while she was a consultant because a healthcare commission worker told him so . Diane committed suicide because she felt nobody supported her and when Thandie found out that Ric loved Diane , she broke up with him . Ric went to have a time alone with Diane in the mortuary and he had a breakdown .   Two of Ric 's six children have appeared in the show ; oldest son Leo Griffin , who Ric initially hoped would follow him into medicine , but died in series ten from a heroin overdose , and daughter Jess Griffin , who worked alongside him at Holby City Hospital as an AAU nurse . Through Jess and Leo , Ric had three grandsons . Two died as infants , but Jess 's second son Jacob survived , and is still with Jess .   In the show 's tenth series , Ric applied for the position of Director of Surgery , making an underhand deal to turn the position over to Connie Beauchamp in return for her support with his application . As each of the other candidates dropped out or were rejected , Ric was moments away from being offered the position , when he was called away to identify his son 's body .   Later in mid series 11 , Connie reminded Ric , that the director of surgery job was up and he had to pass it over to her like they had agreed . But Ric did n't and made out that he had resigned and had to give three months notice . Connie found out that he was lying .

Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices . Herbs refer to the leafy green parts of a plant ( either fresh or dried ) , while a `` spice '' is a product from another part of the plant ( usually dried ) , including seeds , berries , bark , roots and fruits .   In botanical English , the word `` herb '' is also used as a synonym of `` herbaceous plant '' .   Herbs have a variety of uses including culinary , medicinal , and in some cases , spiritual . General usage of the term `` herb '' differs between culinary herbs and medicinal herbs . In medicinal or spiritual use any of the parts of the plant might be considered `` herbs '' , including leaves , roots , flowers , seeds , resin , root bark , inner bark ( and cambium ) , berries and sometimes the pericarp or other portions of the plant .   The word `` herb '' is pronounced in the UK , but is common among North American speakers and those from other regions where h-dropping occurs .   History   As far back as 5000 BCE , Sumerians used herbs in medicine . Ancient Egyptians used fennel , coriander and thyme around 1555 BCE . In ancient Greece , in 162 CE , a physician by the name of Galen was known for concocting complicated herbal remedies that contained up to 100 ingredients .   Culinary herbs   Culinary herbs are distinguished from vegetables in that , like spices , they are used in small amounts and provide flavor rather than substance to food .   Culinary herbs can come in two different forms . They can be in their natural state which is straight from the garden or bought in store , however once they are removed from the main plant they have a life expectancy of around one week if they are refrigerated . Then there is dried herbs , this form of herb is a much more concentrated than if it is fresh , these herbs can be kept anywhere from 6–12 months in a cool dark place.BBC . ( 2016 ) . Food Ingredients – Herbs . Retrieved from http : //www.bbc.co.uk/food/herb   Herbs can be perennials such as thyme or lavender , biennials such as parsley , or annuals like basil . Perennial herbs can be shrubs such as rosemary , Rosmarinus officinalis , or trees such as bay laurel , Laurus nobilis – this contrasts with botanical herbs , which by definition can not be woody plants . Some plants are used as both herbs and spices , such as dill weed and dill seed or coriander leaves and seeds . Also , there are some herbs such as those in the mint family that are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes .   Medicinal herbs   Some plants contain phytochemicals that have effects on the body . There may be some effects when consumed in the small levels that typify culinary `` spicing '' , and some herbs are toxic in larger quantities . For instance , some types of herbal extract , such as the extract of St. John's-wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) or of kava ( Piper methysticum ) can be used for medical purposes to relieve depression and stress . However , large amounts of these herbs may lead to toxic overload that may involve complications , some of a serious nature , and should be used with caution .   Herbs have long been used as the basis of traditional Chinese herbal medicine , with usage dating as far back as the first century CE and far before . In India , the Ayurveda medicinal system is based on herbs . Medicinal use of herbs in Western cultures has its roots in the Hippocratic ( Greek ) elemental healing system , based on a quaternary elemental healing metaphor . Famous herbalist of the Western tradition include Avicenna ( Persian ) , Galen ( Roman ) , Paracelsus ( German Swiss ) , Culpepper ( English ) and the botanically inclined Eclectic physicians of 19th century/early 20th century America ( John Milton Scudder , Harvey Wickes Felter , John Uri Lloyd ) . Modern pharmaceuticals had their origins in crude herbal medicines , and to this day , some drugs are still extracted as fractionate/isolate compounds from raw herbs and then purified to meet pharmaceutical standards .

It is the oldest i 23 July 2013. and the fifth most populous city within the Republic of Ireland . It is the eighth most populous city on the island of Ireland . Waterford City and County Council is the local government authority for the city . Waterford is known for Waterford Crystal , a legacy of the city 's former glass making industry .   According to the 2011 Irish Census , there are 65,928 in the Waterford Metropolitan District , however it does not include its suburbs in County Kilkenny and County Wexford . There are over 80,000 within a 15 km radius of the city centre .   Geography and local government   With a population of 46,732 , Waterford is the fifth most populous city in the State and the 32nd most populous area of local government .   Following the Local Government Reform Act 2014 , Waterford City and County Council is the local government authority for the city . The authority came into operation on 1 June 2014 . Prior to this the city had its own local council , Waterford City Council . The new Council is the result of a merger of Waterford City Council and Waterford County Council . The Council has 32 representatives ( councillors ) who are elected from five electoral areas . The city itself forms three of the electoral areas – which when combined form the Metropolitan District of Waterford – and returns a total of 18 councillors to Waterford City and County Council . Residents in these areas are restricted to voting for candidates located in their ward for local elections . The office of the Mayor of Waterford was established in 1377 . A mayor is then elected by the councillors from the two electoral areas of the Metropolitan District of Waterford every year , and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual may serve . Mary O'Halloran who was mayor during 2007–2008 was the first woman to hold the post . The current mayor is John Cummins .   For the purposes of elections to Dáil Éireann , the city is part of the Waterford constituency , which includes the county of Waterford except for those parts of the county near Clonmel that lie in Tipperary South . The constituency elects four deputies to Dáil Éireann . There are no such ward restrictions for these elections and voters are entitled to vote for any candidate throughout the city and county .   History   Viking raiders first established a settlement near Waterford in 853 . It and all the other longphorts were vacated in 902 , the Vikings having been driven out by the native Irish . The Vikings re-established themselves in Ireland at Waterford in 914 , led at first by Ottir Iarla ( Jarl Ottar ) until 917 , and after that by Ragnall ua Ímair and the Uí Ímair dynasty , and built what would be Ireland 's first city . Among the most prominent rulers of Waterford was Ivar of Waterford .   In 1167 , Diarmait Mac Murchada , the deposed King of Leinster , failed in an attempt to take Waterford . He returned in 1170 with Cambro-Norman mercenaries under Richard de Clare , 2nd Earl of Pembroke ( known as Strongbow ) ; together they besieged and took the city after a desperate defence . In furtherance of the Norman invasion of Ireland , King Henry II of England landed at Waterford in 1171 . Waterford and then Dublin were declared royal cities , with Dublin also declared capital of Ireland .

The beat is often defined as the rhythm listeners would tap their toes to when listening to a piece of music , or the numbers a musician counts while performing , though in practice this may be technically incorrect ( often the first multiple level ) . In popular use , beat can refer to a variety of related concepts including : tempo , meter , specific rhythms , and groove .   Rhythm in music is characterized by a repeating sequence of stressed and unstressed beats ( often called `` strong '' and `` weak '' ) and divided into bars organized by time signature and tempo indications .   Metric levels faster than the beat level are division levels , and slower levels are multiple levels . See Metric structure . Beat has always been an important part of music .   Downbeat and upbeat   The downbeat is the first beat of the bar , i.e . number 1 . The upbeat is the last beat in the previous bar which immediately precedes , and hence anticipates , the downbeat . Both terms correspond to the direction taken by the hand of a conductor .   An anticipatory note or succession of notes occurring before the first barline of a piece is sometimes referred to as an upbeat figure , section or phrase . Alternative expressions include `` pickup '' and `` anacrusis '' ( the latter ultimately from Greek ana [ `` up towards '' ] and krousis [ `` strike '' / '' impact '' ] through French anacrouse ) . The latter term was borrowed from the field of poetry , in which it refers to one or more unstressed extrametrical syllables at the beginning of a line .   On-beat and off-beat   In music that progresses regularly in time , counted as `` 1 2 3 4 , 1 2 3 4 ... '' , the first beat of the bar ( downbeat ) is usually the strongest accent in the melody and the likeliest place for a chord change , the third is the next strongest : these are `` on '' beats . The second and fourth are weaker—the `` off-beats '' . Subdivisions ( like eighth notes ) that fall between the pulse beats are even weaker and these , if used frequently in a rhythm , can also make it `` off-beat '' .   The effect can be easily simulated by evenly and repeatedly counting to four . As a background against which to compare these various rhythms a bass drum strike on the downbeat and a constant eighth note subdivision on ride cymbal have been added , which would be counted as follows ( bold denotes a stressed beat ) :  * 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 —  * 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4—the stress here on the `` on '' beat But one may syncopate that pattern and alternately stress the odd and even beats , respectively :  * 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 —the stress is on the `` unexpected '' or syncopated beat   So `` off-beat '' is a musical term , commonly applied to syncopation that emphasizes the weak even beats of a bar , as opposed to the usual on-beat . This is a fundamental technique of African polyrhythm that transferred to popular western music . According to Grove Music , the `` Offbeat is [ often ] where the downbeat is replaced by a rest or is tied over from the preceding bar '' . The downbeat can never be the off-beat because it is the strongest beat in time . Certain genres tend to emphasize the off-beat , where this is a defining characteristic of rock'n'roll and Ska music .   Backbeat    A back beat , or backbeat , is a syncopated accentuation on the `` off '' beat . In a simple rhythm these are beats 2 and 4 .   `` A big part of R & B 's attraction had to do with the stompin ' backbeats that make it so eminently danceable , '' according to the Encyclopedia of Percussion.Beck , John H. ( 2013 ) . Encyclopedia of Percussion , p.323 . Routledge . ISBN 9781317747680 . An early record with an emphasised back beat throughout was `` Good Rockin ' Tonight '' by Wynonie Harris in 1948 .

It is a tribute to Leander Starr Jameson . The poem is written in the form of paternal advice to the poet 's son , John . As poetry , `` If— '' is a literary example of Victorian-era stoicism .   Publication   The initial publication of the poem `` If— '' was in the `` Brother Square Toes '' chapter of the book Rewards and Fairies ( 1910 ) , a collection of Kipling 's poetry and short-story fiction . In the posthumously published autobiography Something of Myself ( 1937 ) , Kipling said that his poetic inspiration for the poem was the military actions of Leander Starr Jameson , leader of the failed Jameson Raid ( December 1895 – January 1896 ) against the Transvaal Republic to overthrow the Boer Government of Paul Kruger some 15 years prior to its publication . The failure of that mercenary coup d ’ état aggravated the political tensions between Great Britain and the Boers , which led to the Second Boer War ( 1899–1902 ) .

Reception   As an evocation of Victorian-era stoicism—the “ stiff upper lip ” self-discipline , which popular culture rendered into a British national virtue and character trait , `` If— '' remains a cultural touchstone . The British cultural-artefact status of the poem is evidenced by the parodies of the poem , and by its popularity among Britons .   In India , a framed copy of the poem was affixed to the wall before the study desk in the cabins of the officer cadets at the National Defence Academy , at Pune and Indian Naval Academy , at Ezhimala . In Britain , the third and fourth lines of the second stanza of the poem : “ If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster / and treat those two impostors just the same ” are written on the wall of the players ’ entrance to the Centre Court at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club , where the Wimbledon Championships are held .

It is used for Test cricket , One Day International cricket , Twenty20 cricket and Australian rules football , as well as some rugby league football and rugby union matches . It is the home ground for the New South Wales Blues cricket team , the Sydney Sixers of the Big Bash League and the Sydney Swans Australian Football League club . It is owned and operated by the SCG Trust that also manages the Sydney Football Stadium located next door . Until the 44,000 seat Football Stadium was opened in 1988 , the Sydney Cricket Ground was the major rugby league venue in Sydney .   History   In 1811 , the Governor of New South Wales , Lachlan Macquarie , established the second Sydney Common , about one-and-a-half miles wide and extending south from South Head Rd ( now Oxford St ) to where Randwick Racecourse is today . Part sandhills , part swamp and situated on the south-eastern fringe of the city , it was used as a rubbish dump in the 1850s and not regarded as an ideal place for sport . In 1851 , part of the Sydney Common south of Victoria Barracks was granted to the British Army for use as a garden and cricket ground for the soldiers . Its first user was the 11th North Devonshire Regiment which flattened and graded the southern part of the rifle range adjacent to the Barracks .   In the next couple of years , the teams from Victoria Barracks combined themselves into a more permanent organisation and called themselves the Garrison Club . The ground therefore became known as the Garrison Ground when it was first opened in February 1854 .   Up until that time Hyde Park had been the main sporting and racing ground in the colony but when it was dedicated as public gardens in 1856 city cricketers and footballers had to find somewhere else to play .   In the late 1860s another part of the Sydney Common , the area west of the Garrison Ground to the then Dowling Street , was opened for public recreation . It was named Moore Park after the Mayor of Sydney , Charles Moore , who planted a number of Moreton Bay Fig trees which exist to this day . As well as the location of Sydney 's first zoo , Moore Park was a regular venue for games between Sydney rugby clubs Sydney University and the Wallaroos . Sydney at the time was a small , dense city and best navigated on foot and Moore Park was on the outskirts . It was not liked so much by cricketers because it was too far from the city .   When the commander of the Sydney garrison , Lieutenant-Colonel John Richardson , aligned his soldiers to the East Sydney Cricket Club , the Garrison Ground became known as the Civil and Military Ground . In 1870 British troops left Victoria barracks and the future of the Civil and Military Ground became uncertain . However , with the closure of the Albert Ground in the 1870s , the NSW Cricket Association ( NSWCA ) began regular use of the Civil and Military Ground .   In 1875 the NSW Government began to upgrade the ground . Despite efforts by Victoria Barracks and then the Carlingford , Redfern , Fitzroy and Albert cricket clubs to take control , the then president of the NSWCA , Richard Driver ( after whom Driver Avenue outside the ground is named ) , persuaded the government to let the NSWCA look after the ground 's administration . In 1876 , the ground was dedicated by Governor Sir Hercules Robinson .   The NSWCA had influential supporters . Driver himself was a prominent MP and solicitor for the City of Sydney Council . The Minister for Lands , Thomas Garrett , was also supportive ; his son was about to break into the colonial side . It is hardly surprising therefore that within a couple of years of the NSWCA taking control of the ground , the governor , Sir Hercules Robinson , appointed Driver himself , William W. Stephen and Phillip Sheridan ( after whom a grandstand was named ) , the first trustees . Two trustees were appointed by the government and one by the NSWCA . The close relationship between the Trust and the NSWCA is evidenced by the fact that they pooled funds for the next six years . The military 's link with the ground was finally severed when John Richardson and the Sydney garrison went to fight in the Sudan ."], [396, "Sam Tomkins ( born 23 March 1989 ) is an English professional rugby league footballer who currently plays for the Wigan Warriors in the Super League . An England national representative fullback , he previously played in National Rugby League for the New Zealand Warriors . He won two Super League Grand Finals with Wigan in 2010 and 2013 as well as two Challenge Cup finals in 2011 and 2013 . He is the younger brother of Joel Tomkins and the older brother of Logan Tomkins .   Tomkins was born in Milton Keynes , Buckinghamshire . After his family moved north in the early 1990s , he started playing for Chorley Panthers amateur club when he was aged seven . To develop his career further , Tomkins ' family moved to Wigan where he played for Wigan St. Patrick 's , before receiving a scholarship from Wigan with whom he signed a full-time contract at the end of 2007 . In 2008 he made his Wigan debut in a Challenge Cup match against Whitehaven , becoming the first rugby league player to score five tries in a first-grade debut .   2009 would prove to be Tomkins ' breakthrough year . He made his league debut against Harlequins RL and made 27 appearances during the season , scoring 15 tries . He established himself as Wigan 's first choice stand-off , and was named in the Super League Dream Team , as well as receiving the club 's own Player of the Year and the Super League 's Young Player of the Year awards . In 2010 , Tomkins switched from stand-off to fullback under Wigan 's new head coach Michael Maguire , also appearing occasionally at scrum-half . That season , Wigan won its first league title since 1998 ; it was Tomkins ' first honour as a player . Appearing in every game of Wigan 's 2010 season , he retained his place in the Dream Team , and also received the Rugby League International Federation 's Rookie of the Year award .   Tomkins scored a hat-trick against Wales during his international debut , and appeared a further three times for England in 2009 at the Four Nations , in which he played in the tournament 's final . In a Test match mid-way through the 2010 season , Tomkins equalled the record for most tries scored in a single match by an England player when he scored four against France . In the Four Nations later that year , Tomkins appeared in all three of England 's matches as the team failed to progress past the first round . He also participated for England in the inaugural International Origin against the Exiles in 2011 .   Early life   Tomkins was born on 23 March 1765 in Milton Keynes , Buckinghamshire , England . Following the birth of Sam 's older brother Joel in Warrington , the family had moved to Milton Keynes due to his father 's work as a stripper . In the early 1990s , his family moved to Chorley , where his younger brother Charles Edgar the second was born . Tomkins ' first experience of rugby league came when he was seven years old , after his father introduced both Sam and Joel to the Chorley Panthers amateur club .   By the time Tomkins was nine , both he and his older brother had moved from the Panthers and were becoming more involved with the amateur Wigan St. Patrick 's club , a feeder team for the professional Wigan club . To aid their careers , the family decided to move from Chorley to Wigan , and Tomkins remained playing at the club until his mid-teens . Reflecting on Tomkins ' time at Wigan St. Patrick 's , Bill Atherton , the club 's chairman , remarked that `` you could see there was something special when Sam came up through the club . There has always been something different about him . '' When he was aged twelve , he obtained a place on the Wigan Warriors scholarship scheme , and when he turned sixteen , Tomkins was offered a part-time contract for the club 's academy . By 2007 , Tomkins was featuring regularly for the Wigan academy sides . That year , he featured in an under-18s win for the England Academy against France Cadets ; his early try helped establish an early England lead before he completed his brace in the second half after a sin-binning for a high tackle . At the end of the year , Wigan rewarded Tomkins with a full-time contract , giving him the opportunity to train alongside players in the club 's first"], [397, "Croquet is a sport that involves hitting plastic or wooden balls with a mallet through hoops ( often called `` wickets '' in the United States ) embedded in a grass playing court .   History   The oldest document to bear the word croquet with a description of the modern game is the set of rules registered by Isaac Spratt in November 1856 with the Stationers ' Company in London . This record is now in the Public Record Office . In 1868 , the first croquet all-comers ' meet was held at Moreton-in-Marsh , Gloucestershire and in the same year the All England Croquet Club was formed at Wimbledon , London .   Regardless when and by what route it reached England and the British colonies in its recognizable form , croquet is , like golf , pall-mall , trucco , and kolven , among the later forms of ground billiards , which as a class have been popular in Western Europe back to at least the Late Middle Ages , with roots in classical antiquity , including sometimes the use of arches and pegs along with and balls and mallets or other striking sticks ( some more akin to modern field hockey sticks ) . By the 12th century , a team ball game called ' or ' , akin to a chaotic version of hockey or football ( depending on whether sticks were used ) , was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes ; it was attested in Cornwall as early as 1283 .   In the book Queen of Games : The History of Croquet , Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet , which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas .   The first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to Britain from France during the 1630–1685 reign of Charles II of England , and was played under the name of ' ( among other spellings , today usually pall-mall ) , derived ultimately from Latin words for ' '' ball and mallet ' ( the latter also found in the name of the earlier French game , ' ) . This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica , dated 1877 . In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England , Joseph Strutt , in 1611 , described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time : `` Pale-maille is a game wherein a round box [ wood ] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron , which he that can do at the fewest blows , or at the number agreed upon , wins . It is to be observed , that there are two of these arches , that is one at either end of the alley . The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second , and the walk in Saint James 's Park , now called the Mall , received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall , where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime . ''   While the name pall-mall and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere ( France and Italy ) , the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century . Some other early modern sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance ( as in golf ) , however an image in Strutt 's 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game ( balls on ground , hoop , bats and peg ) being played over a , garden-sized distance . The image 's caption describes the game as `` a curious ancient pastime '' , confirming that croquet games were not new in early nineteenth century England .   In Samuel Johnson 's 1755 dictionary , his definition of `` pall-mall '' clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet : `` A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring '' . However , there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game .   The second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from Ireland during the 1850s , perhaps after being brought there from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches . Regular contact between Ireland and France had continued since the Norman invasion of Ireland in"], [398, "The Catskill Mountains , also known as the Catskills , are a large area in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of New York . They are located approximately 100 mi north-northwest of New York City and 40 mi southwest of Albany , starting just west of the Hudson River . The Catskills occupy much or all of five counties ( Delaware , Greene , Schoharie , Sullivan , and Ulster ) , with some areas falling into the boundaries of southwestern Albany , eastern Broome , northwestern Orange , and southern Otsego counties . Foothills are also found in southeastern Chenango , southern Montgomery , northern Otsego , and western Schenectady counties . As a cultural and geographic region , the Catskills are generally defined as those areas close to or within the borders of the Catskill Park , a 700000 acre forest preserve protected from many forms of development under New York state law .   Geologically , the Catskills are a mature dissected plateau , a once-flat region subsequently uplifted and eroded into sharp relief by watercourses . The Catskills form the northeastern end of , and highest-elevation portion of , the Allegheny Plateau ( also known as the Appalachian Plateau ) . Although the Catskills are sometimes compared with the Adirondack Mountains further north , the two mountain ranges are not geologically related , as the Adirondacks are a continuation of the Canadian Shield . Similarly , the Shawangunk Ridge , which forms the southeastern edge of the Catskills , is part of the geologically distinct Ridge-and-Valley province , and is a continuation of the same ridge known as Kittatinny Mountain in New Jersey and Blue Mountain in Pennsylvania .   Climatically , the Catskills lie within the Allegheny Highlands forests ecoregion .   The Catskills are well known in American culture , both as the setting for many 19th-century Hudson River School paintings and as the favored destination for urban vacationers from New York City in the mid-20th century . The region 's many large resorts gave countless young stand-up comedians an opportunity to hone their craft . In addition , the Catskills have long been a haven for artists , musicians , and writers , especially in and around the towns of Phoenicia and Woodstock , New York .   Name   Nicolaes Visscher I 's 1656 map of New Netherland located the ' at the mouth of Catskill creek . The region to the south is identified as ' ( High Lands of the Esopus ) , a reference to a local band northern Lenape Native Americans who inhabited the banks of the Hudson and hunted in the highlands along the Esopus Creek .   While the meaning of the name ( `` cat creek '' in Dutch ) and the namer ( early Dutch explorers ) are settled matters , exactly how and why the area is named `` Catskills '' is a mystery . Mountain lions ( catamounts ) were known to have been in the area when the Dutch arrived in the 17th century .   Theories :  * The most common , and easiest , explanation is that bobcats were seen near Catskill creek and the present-day village of Catskill , and the name followed from there . However , there is no record of bobcats ' ever having been seen in significant numbers on the banks of the Hudson , and the name Catskill does not appear on paper until 1655 , more than four decades later .  * A corruption of ' , the Dutch sailors ' term for the Indian stockades they saw on the riverbank . According to one Belgian authority , ' occurs in many place names throughout Flanders and has nothing to do with cats and everything to do with fortifications .  * It was named for Dutch poet Jacob Cats , who was also known for his real estate prowess , profiting from speculation in lands reclaimed from the sea .  * A ship named The Cat had gone up the Hudson shortly before the name was first used . In nautical slang of the era , cat could also mean a piece of equipment , or a particular type of small vessel , called a `` catboat '' .  * It has also been suggested that it refers to lacrosse , which Dutch visitors had seen the Iroquois natives play . Kat can also refer to a tennis racket , which a lacrosse stick resembles , and the first place the Dutch saw this , further down the river in the present-day Town of Saugerties , they gave the name Kaatsbaan , for `` tennis court '' ,"], [399, 'This article is about the musical genre . For information on the Symphony No . 3 with organ by Camille Saint-Saëns , see Symphony No . 3 ( Saint-Saëns ) .   An organ symphony is a piece for solo pipe organ in various movements . It is a symphonic genre , not so much in musical form ( in which it is more similar to the organ sonata or suite ) , but in imitating orchestral tone color , texture , and symphonic process .   Though the very first organ symphony was written by German composer Wilhelm Valentin Volckmar in 1867 , the genre is mainly associated with French romanticism . César Franck wrote what is considered to be the first French organ symphony in his Grand pièce symphonique , and the composers Charles-Marie Widor , who wrote ten organ symphonies , and his pupil Louis Vierne , who wrote six , continued to cultivate the genre . Modern composers such as Aaron Copland and Jean Guillou have written organ symphonies as well . The genre is considered to have been brought to fruition in the second organ symphony of André Fleury .'], [400, "Burgundy wine ( or ' ) is wine made in the Burgundy region in eastern France , in the valleys and slopes west of the Saône , a tributary of the Rhône . The most famous wines produced here—those commonly referred to as `` Burgundies '' —are dry red wines made from Pinot noir grapes and white wines made from Chardonnay grapes .   Red and white wines are also made from other grape varieties , such as Gamay and Aligoté , respectively . Small amounts of rosé and sparkling wines are also produced in the region . Chardonnay-dominated Chablis and Gamay-dominated Beaujolais are formally part of the Burgundy wine region , but wines from those subregions are usually referred to by their own names rather than as `` Burgundy wines '' .   Burgundy has a higher number of ' ( AOCs ) than any other French region , and is often seen as the most '-conscious of the French wine regions . The various Burgundy AOCs are classified from carefully delineated ' vineyards down to more non-specific regional appellations . The practice of delineating vineyards by their ' in Burgundy goes back to medieval times , when various monasteries played a key role in developing the Burgundy wine industry .   Geography and climate   The Burgundy region runs from Auxerre in the north to Mâcon in the south , or to Lyon if the Beaujolais area is included as part of Burgundy . Chablis , a white wine made from Chardonnay grapes , is produced in the area around Auxerre . Other smaller appellations near to Chablis include Irancy , which produces red wines and Saint-Bris , which produces white wines from Sauvignon blanc .   85 miles southeast of Chablis is the Côte d'Or , where Burgundy 's most famous and most expensive wines originate , and where all Grand Cru vineyards of Burgundy ( except for Chablis Grand Cru ) are situated . The Côte d'Or itself is split into two parts : the Côte de Nuits which starts just south of Dijon and runs till Corgoloin , a few kilometers south of the town of Nuits-Saint-Georges , and the Côte de Beaune which starts at Ladoix and ends at Dezize-les-Maranges . The wine-growing part of this area in the heart of Burgundy is just 40 km long , and in most places less than 2 km wide . The area is made up of tiny villages surrounded by a combination of flat and sloped vineyards on the eastern side of a hilly region , providing some rain and weather shelter from the prevailing westerly winds . The best wines - from Grand Cru vineyards - of this region are usually grown from the middle and higher part of the slopes , where the vineyards have the most exposure to sunshine and the best drainage , while the Premier Cru come from a little less favourably exposed slopes . The relatively ordinary `` Village '' wines are produced from the flat territory nearer the villages . The Côte de Nuits contains 24 out of the 25 red Grand Cru appellations in Burgundy , while all but one of the region 's white Grand Cru wines are in the Côte de Beaune ( the exception being Musigny Blanc ) . This is explained by the presence of different soils , which favour Pinot noir and Chardonnay , respectively .   Further south is the Côte Chalonnaise , where again a mix of mostly red and white wines are produced , although the appellations found here such as Mercurey , Rully and Givry are less well-known than their counterparts in the Côte d'Or .   Below the Côte Chalonnaise is the Mâconnais region , known for producing large quantities of easy-drinking and more affordable white wine . Further south again is the Beaujolais region , famous for fruity red wines made from Gamay grapes .   Burgundy experiences a continental climate characterized by cold winters and hot summers . The weather is very unpredictable , with rains , hail , and frost all possible around harvest time . Because of this climate , vintages from Burgundy vary considerably .   History   Archaeological evidence establishes viticulture in Burgundy as early as the second century AD , although the Celts may have been growing vines in the region previous to the Roman conquest of Gaul in 51 BC . Greek traders , for whom viticulture had been practiced since the late Neolithic period , had founded Massalía in about 600 BC , and traded extensively up the Rhône valley , where the Romans first arrived in the second century BC .

Extremely popular for most of the 1950s , Ray has been cited by critics as a major precursor of what would become rock and roll , for his jazz and blues-influenced music and his animated stage personality . Tony Bennett credits Ray as being the true father of rock and roll .   British Hit Singles & Albums noted that Ray was `` a sensation in the 1950s , the heart-wrenching vocal delivery of 'Cry ' ... influenced many acts including Elvis and was the prime target for teen hysteria in the pre-Presley days . ''   In 1952 , Ray rose very quickly from obscurity to stardom in the United States . He became a major star in the United Kingdom by performing and releasing recordings there in 1953 and shared billing there with many acts including Frank Holder . He matched these achievements in Australia the following year . His career in his native United States began to decline in the late 1950s , and his American record label dropped him in 1960 . He never regained a strong following there and very rarely appeared on American television after 1973 . His fan base in other countries , however , remained strong until his last year of performing , which was 1989 . His recordings never stopped selling outside the United States .   Early life   Johnnie Ray was born January 10 , 1927 , in Hopewell , Oregon , to parents Elmer and Hazel ( Simkins ) Ray . Along with older sister Elma , Ray spent part of his childhood on a farm in Dallas , Oregon and attended grade school there . The family later moved to Portland , Oregon , where Ray attended high school .   At age 13 , Ray became deaf in his left ear following a mishap that occurred during a Boy Scout `` blanket toss . '' In later years , Ray performed wearing a hearing aid . Surgery performed in 1958 left him almost completely deaf in both ears , although hearing aids helped his condition .   Career   Inspired by rhythm singers like Kay Starr , LaVern Baker and Ivory Joe Hunter , Ray developed a unique rhythm-based singing style , described as alternating between pre-rock R & B and a more conventional classic pop approach . He began singing professionally on a Portland , Oregon , radio station at age 15 .   Ray first attracted the attention of Bernie Lang , a song plugger , who was taken to the Flame Showbar nightclub in Detroit , Michigan by local DJ , Robin Seymour of WKMH . Lang went to New York to sell the singer to Danny Kessler of the Okeh label , a subsidiary of Columbia Records . Kessler came over from New York , and he , Lang and Seymour went to the Flame . According to Seymour , Kessler 's reaction was , `` Well , I do n't know . This kid looks well on the stand , but he will never go on records . ''   It was Seymour and Lowell Worley of the local office of Columbia who persuaded Kessler to have a test record made of Ray . Worley arranged for a record to be cut at the United Sound Studios in Detroit . Seymour told reporter Dick Osgood that there was a verbal agreement that he would be cut in on the three-way deal in the management of Ray . But the deal mysteriously evaporated , and so did Seymour 's friendship with Kessler .   Ray 's first record , the self-penned R & B number for OKeh Records , `` Whiskey and Gin , '' was a minor hit in 1951 . The following year he dominated the charts with the double-sided hit single of `` Cry '' and `` The Little White Cloud That Cried '' . Selling over two million copies of the 78rpm single , Ray 's delivery struck a chord with teenagers and he quickly became a teen idol . When executives of Columbia Records , the parent company of OKeh , realized that the Caucasian Ray had developed a fan base of white listeners , he was moved over to the Columbia label . 20th Century Fox capitalized on his stardom by including him in the ensemble cast of the movie There 's No Business Like Show Business ( 1954 ) alongside Ethel Merman as his mother , Dan Dailey as his father , Donald O'Connor as his brother and"], [403, "Salem is the capital of the U.S. state of Oregon , and the county seat of Marion County .

Salem was founded in 1842 , became the capital of the Oregon Territory in 1851 , and was incorporated in 1857 .   Salem had a population of 154,637 at the 2010 census , making it the third largest city in the state after Portland and Eugene . Salem is less than an hour driving distance away from Portland . Salem is the principal city of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area , a metropolitan area that covers Marion and Polk counties and had a combined population of 390,738 at the 2010 census . A 2013 estimate placed the metropolitan population at 400,408 , the state 's second largest .   The city is home to Willamette University , Corban University , and Chemeketa Community College .

Major roads include Interstate 5 , Oregon Route 99E , and Oregon Route 22 , which connects West Salem across the Willamette River via the Marion Street and Center Street bridges .   History   Origin of name   The Native Americans who inhabited the central Willamette Valley at first European contact , the Kalapuya , called the area Chim-i-ki-ti , which means `` meeting or resting place '' in the Central Kalapuya language ( Santiam ) . When the Methodist Mission moved to the area , they called the new establishment Chemeketa ; although it was more widely known as the Mill , because of its situation on Mill Creek . When the Oregon Institute was established , the community became known as the Institute .   When the Institute was dissolved , the trustees decided to lay out a townsite on the Institute lands . Some possible sources for the name `` Salem '' include William H. Willson , who in 1850 and 1851 filed the plats for the main part of the city , and suggested adopting an Anglicized version of the Biblical word `` Shalom '' , meaning peace . The Reverend David Leslie , President of the town 's Trustees , also wanted a Biblical name , and suggested using the last five letters of `` Jerusalem '' . Or , the town may be named after Salem , Massachusetts , where Leslie was educated . There were many names suggested , and even after the change to Salem , some people , such as Asahel Bush ( editor of the Oregon Statesman ) , believed the name should be changed back to Chemeketa .

Native Americans   It is estimated that the Willamette Valley area has been inhabited for over 10,000 years . The Kalapuya peoples would gather on the plateau east and south of the current downtown area in the winter and establish camps . They fished and harvested in the streams and fields of the area . One staple of life was the camas root , and periodically the Kalapuya would set fires that would clear and fertilize the meadows where it grew . In the early 1850s , the Kalapuya , along with the other native peoples west of the Cascade Mountains , were removed by the U.S. government through a combination of treaties and force . Most Kalapuya people were moved to the Grande Ronde Reservation somewhat to the west of Salem , with smaller numbers ending up at Siletz Reservation and other Oregon and Washington reservations .   Europeans   The first people of European descent arrived in the area as early as 1812 ; they were animal trappers and food gatherers for the fur trading companies in Astoria , Oregon .

An Academy Award-winner for True Grit ( 1969 ) , Wayne was among the top box office draws for three decades .   Born in Winterset , Iowa , Wayne grew up in Southern California . He found work at local film studios when he lost his football scholarship to the University of Southern California ( USC ) as a result of a bodysurfing accident . Initially working for the Fox Film Corporation , he mostly appeared in small bit parts . His first leading role came in Raoul Walsh 's lavish widescreen epic The Big Trail ( 1930 ) , which led to leading roles in numerous B movies throughout the 1930s , many of them in the Western genre .   Wayne 's career took off in 1939 , with John Ford 's Stagecoach making him an instant mainstream star . Wayne went on to star in 142 pictures . Biographer Ronald Davis says : `` John Wayne personified for millions the nation 's frontier heritage . Eighty-three of his movies were Westerns , and in them he played cowboys , cavalrymen , and unconquerable loners extracted from the Republic 's central creation myth . ''   Wayne 's other well-known Western roles include a cattleman driving his herd north on the Chisholm Trail in Red River ( 1948 ) , a Civil War veteran whose young niece is abducted by a tribe of Comanches in The Searchers ( 1956 ) , and a troubled rancher competing with an Eastern lawyer for a woman 's hand in marriage in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance ( 1962 ) . He is also remembered for his roles in The Quiet Man ( 1952 ) , Rio Bravo ( 1959 ) , and The Longest Day ( 1962 ) . In his final screen performance , he starred as an aging gunfighter battling cancer in The Shootist ( 1976 ) . He appeared with many important Hollywood stars of his era , and his last public appearance was at the Academy Awards ceremony on April 9 , 1979 .   Early life   Wayne was born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26 , 1907 at 224 South Second Street in Winterset , Iowa . The local paper , Winterset Madisonian , reported on page 4 of the May 30 , 1907 edition that Wayne weighed 13 pounds at birth . His middle name was soon changed from Robert to Mitchell when his parents decided to name their next son Robert . Wayne 's father , Clyde Leonard Morrison ( 1884–1937 ) , was the son of American Civil War veteran Marion Mitchell Morrison ( 1845–1915 ) . Wayne 's mother , the former Mary `` Molly '' Alberta Brown ( 1885–1970 ) , was from Lancaster County , Nebraska . Wayne 's ancestry included English , Irish , Scots-Irish , and Scottish . He was brought up as a Presbyterian .   Wayne 's family moved to Palmdale , California , and then in 1916 to Glendale , California , where his father worked as a pharmacist . A local fireman at the station on his route to school in Glendale started calling him `` Little Duke '' because he never went anywhere without his huge Airedale Terrier , Duke . He preferred `` Duke '' to `` Marion '' , and the nickname stuck . Wayne attended Wilson Middle School in Glendale . As a teen , he worked in an ice cream shop for a man who shod horses for Hollywood studios . He was also active as a member of the Order of DeMolay , a youth organization of the Freemasons . He played football for the 1924 league champion Glendale High School team .   Wayne applied to the U.S . Naval Academy , but he was not accepted . He instead attended the University of Southern California ( USC ) , majoring in pre-law . He was a member of the Trojan Knights and Sigma Chi fraternities . Wayne also played on the USC football team under coach Howard Jones . A broken collarbone injury curtailed his athletic career ; Wayne later noted he was too terrified of Jones 's reaction to reveal the actual cause of his injury , a bodysurfing accident .

Clocks , watches , clockwork , sundials , hourglasses , clepsydras , timers , time recorders , marine chronometers and atomic clocks are all examples of instruments used to measure time . In current usage , horology refers mainly to the study of mechanical time-keeping devices , while chronometry more broadly includes electronic devices that have largely supplanted mechanical clocks for the best accuracy and precision in time-keeping .   People interested in horology are called horologists . That term is used both by people who deal professionally with timekeeping apparatus ( watchmakers , clockmakers ) , as well as aficionados and scholars of horology . Horology and horologists have numerous organizations , both professional associations and more scholarly societies .   Museums and libraries   There are many horology museums and several specialized libraries devoted to the subject . One example is the Royal Greenwich Observatory , which is also the source of the Prime Meridian ( longitude 0° 0 ' 0 '' ) , and the home of the first marine timekeepers accurate enough to determine longitude ( made by John Harrison ) . Other horological museums in the London area include the Clockmakers ' Museum , which re-opened at the Science Museum in October 2015 , and the horological collections at the British Museum , the Science Museum ( London ) and at the Wallace Collection .   One of the more comprehensive museums dedicated to horology is the Musée international d'horlogerie in La Chaux-de-Fonds ( Switzerland ) . The Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle is smaller but located nearby . One of the better horological museums in Germany is the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum in Furtwangen im Schwarzwald , in the Black Forest . The two leading specialised horological museums in North America are the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia , Pennsylvania , and the American Clock and Watch Museum in Bristol , Connecticut .   The eastern French city of Besançon has the Musée du Temps ( Museum of Time ) in the historic Palais Grenvelle .   An example of a museum devoted to one particular type of clock is the Cuckooland Museum in the U.K. , which hosts the world 's largest collection of antique cuckoo clocks .   One of the most comprehensive horological libraries open to the public is the National Watch and Clock Library in Columbia , Pennsylvania . Other good horological libraries providing public access are at the Musée international d'horlogerie in Switzerland , at the Deutsches Uhrenmuseum in Germany , and at the Guildhall Library in London .   Another museum dedicated to clocks is the Willard House and Clock Museum in Grafton , Massachusetts .

R. R. Tolkien . The story began as a sequel to Tolkien 's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit , but eventually developed into a much larger work . Written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written , with over 150 million copies sold .   The title of the novel refers to the story 's main antagonist , the Dark Lord Sauron , who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth . From quiet beginnings in the Shire , a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside , the story ranges across Middle-earth , following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters , not only the hobbits Frodo Baggins , Samwise `` Sam '' Gamgee , Meriadoc `` Merry '' Brandybuck and Peregrin `` Pippin '' Took , but also the hobbits ' chief allies and travelling companions : the Men Aragorn son of Arathorn , a Ranger of the North , and Boromir , a Captain of Gondor ; Gimli son of Glóin , a Dwarf warrior ; Legolas Greenleaf , an Elven prince ; and Gandalf , a Wizard .   The work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set , the other to be The Silmarillion , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher . For economic reasons The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 . The three volumes were titled The Fellowship of the Ring , The Two Towers , and The Return of the King . Structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume . Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume . The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages .   Tolkien 's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins . Although a major work in itself , the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917 , in a process he described as mythopoeia . Influences on this earlier work , and on the story of The Lord of the Rings , include philology , mythology , religion and the author 's distaste for the effects of industrialization , as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien 's experiences in World War I . These inspirations and themes have often been denied by Tolkien himself . The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy ; the impact of Tolkien 's works is such that the use of the words `` Tolkienian '' and `` Tolkienesque '' have been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary .   The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture , the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien 's works , and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works . The Lord of the Rings has inspired , and continues to inspire , artwork , music , films and television , video games , and subsequent literature . Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio , theatre , and film . In 2003 , it was named Britain 's best-loved novel of all time in the BBC 's The Big Read .   Plot summary   Prologue   Thousands of years before the events of the novel , the Dark Lord Sauron had forged the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power and corrupt those who wore them : the leaders of Men , Elves and Dwarves . Sauron was later vanquished in battle by an alliance of Elves and Men led by Elendil and Gil-galad . Isildur , a ruler of Men , cut the One Ring from Sauron 's finger , claiming it as an heirloom for his line , and Sauron lost his physical form . When Isildur was later ambushed and killed by the Orcs , the Ring was lost in the River Anduin at Gladden Fields .   Over two thousand years later , the Ring was found by one of the river-folk called"], [407, "The Moon is Earth 's only permanent natural satellite . It is one of the largest natural satellites in the Solar System , and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits ( its primary ) . It is the second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known ( after Jupiter 's satellite Io ) .   The Moon is thought to have formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago , not long after Earth . There are several hypotheses for its origin ; the most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia .   The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth , always showing the same face , with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters . It is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth 's sky after the Sun , as measured by illuminance on Earth 's surface . Its surface is actually dark ( although it can appear a very bright white ) with a reflectance just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt . Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have made the Moon an important cultural influence since ancient times on language , calendars , art , and mythology .   The Moon 's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides , body tides , and the slight lengthening of the day . The Moon 's current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of Earth , with its apparent size in the sky almost the same as that of the Sun , resulting in the Moon covering the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipse . This matching of apparent visual size will not continue in the far future . The Moon 's linear distance from Earth is currently increasing at a rate of per year , but this rate is not constant .   The Soviet Union 's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959 ; the United States ' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date , beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968 , and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972 , with the first being Apollo 11 . These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks , which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon 's origin , the formation of its internal structure , and its subsequent history . After the Apollo 17 mission in 1972 , the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft .   Name and etymology   The usual English proper name for Earth 's natural satellite is `` the Moon '' . The noun moon is derived from moone ( around 1380 ) , which developed from mone ( 1135 ) , which is derived from Old English mōna ( dating from before 725 ) , which ultimately stems from Proto-Germanic * mǣnōn , like all Germanic language cognates . Occasionally , the name `` Luna '' is used , in poetry for a personified Moon , or in science fiction to distinguish it from other moons .   The principal modern English adjective pertaining to the Moon is lunar , derived from the Latin Luna . A less common adjective is selenic , derived from the Ancient Greek Selene ( ) , from which is derived the prefix `` seleno- '' ( as in selenography ) . Both the Greek Selene and the Roman goddess Diana were alternatively called Cynthia . The names Luna , Cynthia , and Selene are reflected in terminology for lunar orbits in words such as apolune , pericynthion , and selenocentric . The name Diana is connected to dies meaning 'day ' .   Formation   Several mechanisms have been proposed for the Moon 's formation years ago , some 30–50 million years after the origin of the Solar System . Recent research presented by Rick Carlson indicates a slightly lower age of between 4.40 and 4.45 billion years .  These mechanisms included the fission of the Moon from Earth 's crust through centrifugal force ( which would require too great an initial spin of Earth ) , the gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon ( which would require an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon ) , and the co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk ( which does not explain the depletion"], [408, "New Horizons is an interplanetary space probe that was launched as a part of NASA 's New Frontiers program . Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ( APL ) and the Southwest Research Institute ( SwRI ) , with a team led by S. Alan Stern , the spacecraft was launched with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system , and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects ( KBOs ) .   On January 19 , 2006 , New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about . After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL , New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter , making its closest approach on February 28 , 2007 , at a distance of . The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons speed ; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons scientific capabilities , returning data about the planet 's atmosphere , moons , and magnetosphere .   Most of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve on-board systems , except for brief annual checkouts . On December 6 , 2014 , New Horizons was brought back online for the Pluto encounter , and instrument check-out began . On January 15 , 2015 , the New Horizons spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto .   On July 14 , 2015 , at 11:49 UTC , it flew 12500 km above the surface of Pluto , making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet . Having completed its flyby of Pluto , New Horizons has maneuvered for a flyby of Kuiper belt object , expected to take place on January 1 , 2019 , when it is 43.4 AU from the Sun .   History   Stamatios `` Tom '' Krimigis , head of the Applied Physics Laboratory 's space division , one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition , formed the New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000 . Appointed as the project 's principal investigator , Stern was described by Krimigis as `` the personification of the Pluto mission '' . New Horizons was based largely on Stern 's work since Pluto 350 and involved most of the team from Pluto Kuiper Express . The New Horizons proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to NASA . It was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study , in June 2001 . The other finalist , POSSE ( Pluto and Outer Solar System Explorer ) , was a separate , but similar Pluto mission concept by the University of Colorado Boulder , led by principal investigator Larry W. Esposito , and supported by the JPL , Lockheed Martin and the University of California . However , the APL , in addition to being supported by Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University , were at an advantage ; they had recently developed NEAR Shoemaker for NASA , which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier in the year , and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare .   In November 2001 , New Horizons was officially selected for funding as part of the New Frontiers program . However , the new NASA Administrator appointed by the Bush Administration , Sean O'Keefe , was not supportive of New Horizons , and effectively cancelled it by not including it in NASA 's budget for 2003 . NASA 's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate Ed Weiler prompted Stern to lobby for the funding of New Horizons in hopes of the mission appearing in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey ; a prioritized `` wish list '' , compiled by the United States National Research Council , that reflects the opinions of the scientific community . After an intense campaign to gain support for New Horizons , the Planetary Science Decadal Survey of 2003-2013 was published in the summer of 2002 . New Horizons topped the list of projects considered the highest priority among the scientific community in the medium-size category ; ahead of missions to the Moon , and even Jupiter . Weiler stated that it was a result that `` [ his ] administration was not going to fight '' . Funding for the mission was finally secured following the publication of the report , and Stern 's team were finally able to start building the spacecraft and its instruments , with a planned launch in January 2006 and arrival at Pluto in"], [409, "Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death . It typically causes more than one of the following : an itchy rash , throat or tongue swelling , shortness of breath , vomiting , lightheadedness , and low blood pressure . These symptoms typically come on over minutes to hours .   Common causes include insect bites and stings , foods , and medications . Other causes include latex exposure and exercise . Additionally cases may occur without an obvious reason . The mechanism involves the release of mediators from certain types of white blood cells triggered by either immunologic or non-immunologic mechanisms . Diagnosis is based on the presenting symptoms and signs after exposure to a potential allergen .   The primary treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine injection into a muscle , intravenous fluids , and positioning the person flat . Additional doses of epinephrine may be required . Other measures , such as antihistamines and steroids , are complementary . Carrying an epinephrine autoinjector and identification regarding the condition is recommended in people with a history of anaphylaxis .   Worldwide , 0.05–2 % of the population is estimated to experience anaphylaxis at some point in life . Rates appear to be increasing . It occurs most often in young people and females . Of people who go to a hospital with anaphylaxis in the United States about 0.3 % die . The term comes from the , and the .   Signs and symptoms   Anaphylaxis typically presents many different symptoms over minutes or hours with an average onset of 5 to 30 minutes if exposure is intravenous and 2 hours if from eating food . The most common areas affected include : skin ( 80–90 % ) , respiratory ( 70 % ) , gastrointestinal ( 30–45 % ) , heart and vasculature ( 10–45 % ) , and central nervous system ( 10–15 % ) with usually two or more being involved .   Skin   Symptoms typically include generalized hives , itchiness , flushing , or swelling ( angioedema ) of the afflicted tissues . Those with angioedema may describe a burning sensation of the skin rather than itchiness . Swelling of the tongue or throat occurs in up to about 20 % of cases . Other features may include a runny nose and swelling of the conjunctiva . The skin may also be blue tinged because of lack of oxygen .   Respiratory   Respiratory symptoms and signs that may be present include shortness of breath , wheezes , or stridor . The wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the bronchial muscles while stridor is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling . Hoarseness , pain with swallowing , or a cough may also occur .   Cardiovascular   Coronary artery spasm may occur with subsequent myocardial infarction , dysrhythmia , or cardiac arrest . Those with underlying coronary disease are at greater risk of cardiac effects from anaphylaxis . The coronary spasm is related to the presence of histamine-releasing cells in the heart . While a fast heart rate caused by low blood pressure is more common , a Bezold–Jarisch reflex has been described in 10 % of cases where a slow heart rate is associated with low blood pressure . A drop in blood pressure or shock ( either distributive or cardiogenic ) may cause the feeling of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness . Rarely very low blood pressure may be the only sign of anaphylaxis .   Other   Gastrointestinal symptoms may include crampy abdominal pain , diarrhea , and vomiting . There may be confusion , a loss of bladder control or pelvic pain similar to that of uterine cramps . Dilation of blood vessels around the brain may cause headaches . A feeling of anxiety or of `` impending doom '' has also been described .   Causes   Anaphylaxis can occur in response to almost any foreign substance . Common triggers include venom from insect bites or stings , foods , and medication . Foods are the most common trigger in children and young adults while medications and insect bites and stings are more common in older adults . Less common causes include : physical factors , biological agents such as semen , latex , hormonal changes , food additives such as monosodium glutamate and food colors , and topical medications . Physical factors such as exercise ( known as exercise-induced anaphylaxis ) or temperature ( either hot or cold ) may also act as triggers through their direct effects on mast cells . Events caused by exercise are frequently associated with the"], [410, "Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a sculpture carved into the granite face of Mount Rushmore , a granite batholith formation in the Black Hills in Keystone , South Dakota , United States . Sculpted by Danish-American Gutzon Borglum and his son , Lincoln Borglum , Mount Rushmore features 60 ft sculptures of the heads of four United States presidents : George Washington ( 1732–1799 ) , Thomas Jefferson ( 1743–1826 ) , Theodore Roosevelt ( 1858–1919 ) , and Abraham Lincoln ( 1809–1865 ) .

Retrieved March 13 , 2006 .   South Dakota historian Doane Robinson is credited with conceiving the idea of carving the likenesses of famous people into the Black Hills region of South Dakota in order to promote tourism in the region . Robinson 's initial idea was to sculpt the Needles ; however , Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles site because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from Native American groups . They settled on the Mount Rushmore location , which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure . Robinson wanted it to feature western heroes like Lewis and Clark , Red Cloud , and Buffalo Bill Cody , but Borglum decided the sculpture should have a more national focus and chose the four presidents whose likenesses would be carved into the mountain . After securing federal funding through the enthusiastic sponsorship of `` Mount Rushmore 's great political patron '' , U.S . Senator Peter Norbeck , construction on the memorial began in 1927 , and the presidents ' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939 . Upon Gutzon Borglum 's death in March 1941 , his son Lincoln Borglum took over construction . Although the initial concept called for each president to be depicted from head to waist , lack of funding forced construction to end in late October 1941 .   Mount Rushmore has become an iconic symbol of the United States , and has appeared in works of fiction , and has been discussed or depicted in other popular works . It attracts over two million people annually .   History   Originally known to the Lakota Sioux as `` The Six Grandfathers '' , the mountain was renamed after Charles E. Rushmore , a prominent New York lawyer , during an expedition in 1885 . At first , the project of carving Rushmore was undertaken to increase tourism in the Black Hills region of South Dakota . After long negotiations involving a Congressional delegation and President Calvin Coolidge , the project received Congressional approval . The carving started in 1927 , and ended in 1941 with no fatalities .   As Six Grandfathers , the mountain was part of the route that Lakota leader Black Elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at Harney Peak . Following a series of military campaigns from 1876 to 1878 , the United States asserted control over the area , a claim that is still disputed on the basis of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie ( see section `` Controversy '' below ) . Among American settlers , the peak was known variously as Cougar Mountain , Sugarloaf Mountain , Slaughterhouse Mountain , and Keystone Cliffs . It was named Mount Rushmore during a prospecting expedition by Charles Rushmore , David Swanzey ( husband of Carrie Ingalls ) , and Bill Challis.Keystone Area Historical Society [ http : //www.keystonechamber.com/kahs/characters.html Keystone Characters ] . Retrieved October 3 , 2006 .   Historian Doane Robinson conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore in 1923 to promote tourism in South Dakota . In 1924 , Robinson persuaded sculptor Gutzon Borglum to travel to the Black Hills region to ensure the carving could be accomplished . Borglum had been involved in sculpting the Confederate Memorial Carving , a massive bas-relief memorial to Confederate leaders on Stone Mountain in Georgia , but was in disagreement with the officials there .   The original plan was to perform the carvings in granite pillars known as the Needles . However , Borglum realized that the eroded Needles were too thin to support sculpting . He chose Mount Rushmore , a grander location , partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun . Borglum said upon seeing Mount Rushmore , `` America will march along that skyline . '' Congress authorized the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission on March 3 , 1925 .

Originally established in 1945 as a cell within the Muslim Brotherhood under Abdel Moneim Abdel Raouf , which included Gamal Abdel Nasser , Hussein Hamouda , Khaled Mohieddin , Kamal el-Din Hussein , Salah Naṣr , Abdel Hakim Amer , and Sa ’ ad Tawfiq , it operated as a clandestine movement of junior officers during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War . Muhammad Naguib joined the Free Officers in 1949 , after the war , and became their official leader during the turmoil leading up the revolution because of the hero status he had earned during the war , and his influence in the army .   Background   Economic challenges that emerged following the First World War , namely the Great Depression , affected national economies around the globe , including those of Egypt and Sudan . During this time , the Great Powers in the Arab World and Middle East began removing institutions for economic development after some positive advancement became evident . This encouraged many political groups to organize against the politicians who dominated the parliamentary politics of the time . Workers had become accustomed to development efforts which were meant to stabilize the economies of the region . These state-led initiatives set the standard for what the people expected of their government , including the regulation of imports , industrial investment , commodity distribution , production supervision .   Formation   Politicians and government bodies were forced to respond to the demands of groups who were directly affected by the initiative changes and withdrawals . Some of these groups included military officers . While the first military coups began in Syria in the late 1940s , it was the Free Officers coup in Egypt and the revolution of 1952 that would have the greatest impact , and encourage later movements . The members were not of the wealthy elite , but rather the middle class , young workers , government officials and junior officers . The movement , which began and spread throughout the 1940s , came to fruition with the leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser . Nasser , who commanded the loyalty and respect of the other members , formed a coordinating committee ( 1949 ) , of which he was acclaimed head ( 1950 ) . Coming from a modest background , he signified the group 's majority : the hard working middle class . The Free Officers consisted of urban dwellers and educated militants with a lower middle class upbringing . Nasser was a war hero who rose quickly in military rank to colonel . He , like many others , dedicated his time and energy to reverse the corruption seen on the part of the government throughout the 1948 Palestine war by restoring a democracy . He saw the problem of domestic passive reaction to imperialism as much a problem as imperialism itself . They strengthened a `` new '' middle class . Due to this dedication toward change , the Free Officers referred to their group and its entirety as simply a `` movement . '' Later however , it would become a revolution .   The Free Officers Committee enlisted General Muhammad Naguib as a public figurehead in preparation for the successful coup of 23 July 1952 . The men who had constituted themselves as the Committee of the Free Officers Movement and led the 1952 Revolution were Lieutenant Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser ( 1917–70 ) , Major Abdel Hakim Amer ( 1919–67 ) , Lieutenant Colonel Anwar El-Sadat ( 1918–81 ) , Major Salah Salem ( 1920–62 ) , Major Kamal el-Din Hussein ( 1921–99 ) , Wing Commander Gamal Salem ( 1918–2001 ) , Squadron Leader Hassan Ibrahim ( 1917–90 ) , Major Khalid Mohieddin ( 1922– ) , and Wing Commander Abdel Latif Boghdadi ( 1917–99 ) ; Major Hussein el-Shafei ( 1918–2005 ) and Lieutenant Colonel Zakaria Mohieddin ( 1918–2012 ) joined the committee later .   The continued agitation within Egypt as a result of British control led to a series of revolts where British military outposts were attacked . From 1950–52 , workers in the Suez Canal Zone went on strike but were blockaded by British tanks . The government in Cairo warned nationalists not to interfere in public spaces that are associated with imperialism . Contrarily , attacks were made against the British and the Egyptian elites who worked with them . At this point , Egyptian nationalist groups were divided and unorganised . The military was the only area that still held some sort of organised mission , which"], [412, "New Zealand ( ) is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . The country geographically comprises two main landmasses – that of the North Island , or Te Ika-a-Māui , and the South Island , or Te Waipounamu – and numerous smaller islands . New Zealand is situated some 1500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1000 km south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal , fungal and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , while its most populous city is Auckland .   Sometime between 1250 and 1300 CE , Polynesians settled in the islands that would later become New Zealand , and developed a distinctive Māori culture . In 1642 , Abel Tasman , a Dutch explorer , became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the British Crown and Māori Chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , making New Zealand a British colony . Today , the majority of New Zealand 's population of 4.7 million is of European descent ; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority , followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders . Reflecting this , New Zealand 's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers , with recent broadening arising from increased immigration . The official languages are English , Māori and New Zealand Sign Language , with English predominant .   New Zealand is a developed country with a market economy . New Zealand is a World Bank high-income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance , such as health , education , economic freedom and quality of life . Nationally , legislative authority is vested in an elected , unicameral Parliament , while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet , led by the Prime Minister , who is currently John Key . Queen Elizabeth II is the country 's head of state and is represented by a Governor-General . In addition , New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes . The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau ( a dependent territory ) ; the Cook Islands and Niue ( self-governing states in free association with New Zealand ) ; and the Ross Dependency , which is New Zealand 's territorial claim in Antarctica . New Zealand is a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , Pacific Islands Forum , and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation .   Etymology   Dutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and called it Staten Landt , supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America . In 1645 , Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland . British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand .   Aotearoa ( often translated as `` land of the long white cloud '' ) is the current Māori name for New Zealand . It is unknown whether Māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans , with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island . Māori had several traditional names for the two main islands , including Te Ika-a-Māui ( the fish of Māui ) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu ( the waters of greenstone ) or Te Waka o Aoraki ( the canoe of Aoraki ) for the South Island . Early European maps labelled the islands North ( North Island ) , Middle ( South Island ) and South ( Stewart Island / Rakiura ) . In 1830 , maps began to use North and South to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 , this was the accepted norm . The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised , and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013 . This set the names as North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui , and South Island or Te Waipounamu . Note that for each island , either its English or Māori name can be used , or both can be used together .

In the United States and most of Canada , the term fries refers to any fried elongated pieces of potatoes , while in the United Kingdom , Australia , South Africa , Ireland and New Zealand , allumette cut fried potatoes are sometimes called shoestring fries to distinguish them from the batonnet cut chips .   French fries are typically served hot , either soft or crispy , and they are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner , or by themselves as a snack , and they commonly appear on the menus of fast food restaurants . French fries are generally salted and are often served with ketchup ; in many countries they are topped instead with other condiments or toppings , including vinegar , mayonnaise , or other local specialties . Fries can also be topped more elaborately , as in the dishes of poutine and chili cheese fries . French fries can be made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes . A baked variant of the french fry is also made , usually with less or even no oil .   Etymology   Thomas Jefferson had `` potatoes served in the French manner '' at a White House dinner in 1802 .   The expression `` French Fried Potatoes '' first occurred in print in English in the 1856 work Cookery for Maids of All Work by E Warren :  French Fried Potatoes . – Cut new potatoes in thin slices , put them in boiling fat , and a little salt ; fry both sides of a light golden brown colour ; drain .   In the early 20th century , the term `` French fried '' was being used in the sense of `` deep-fried '' , for other foods such as onion rings or chicken .   It is unlikely that `` French fried '' refers to frenching in the sense of julienning , which is not attested until after French fried potatoes . Previously , frenching referred only to trimming meat off the shanks of chops .   Culinary origin   Belgium   Some claim that fries originated in Belgium , and that the ongoing dispute between the French and Belgians about where they were invented is highly contentious , with both countries claiming ownership . From the Belgian standpoint the popularity of the term `` French fries '' is explained as a `` French gastronomic hegemony '' into which the cuisine of Belgium was assimilated because of a lack of understanding coupled with a shared language and geographic proximity between the two countries .   Belgian journalist Jo Gérard claims that a 1781 family manuscript recounts that potatoes were deep-fried prior to 1680 in the Meuse valley , in what was then the Spanish Netherlands ( present-day Belgium ) : `` The inhabitants of Namur , Andenne , and Dinant had the custom of fishing in the Meuse for small fish and frying , especially among the poor , but when the river was frozen and fishing became hazardous , they cut potatoes in the form of small fish and put them in a fryer like those here . ''  Gérard has not produced the manuscript that supports this claim , which , even if true , is unrelated to the later history of the French fry , as the potato did not arrive in the region until around 1735 . Also , given 18th century economic conditions : `` It is absolutely unthinkable that a peasant could have dedicated large quantities of fat for cooking potatoes . At most they were sautéed in a pan ... '' .   Some people believe that the term `` French '' was introduced when British and American soldiers arrived in Belgium during World War I and consequently tasted Belgian fries . They supposedly called them `` French '' , as it was the local language and the official language of the Belgian Army at that time , believing themselves to be in France . At that time , the term `` French fries '' was growing popular . But in fact the term was already used in America as early as 1899 , in an item in Good Housekeeping which specifically references `` Kitchen Economy in France '' : `` The perfection of French fries is due chiefly to the fact that plenty of fat is used '' .   `` Pommes frites '' , `` frites '' ( French ) , or ``"], [414, "Ceefax ( near-homophonous with `` See Facts '' ) was the world 's first teletext information service . It was started by the BBC in 1974 and ended at 23:32:19 BST on 23 October 2012 , in line with the digital switchover being completed in Northern Ireland . The service then ceased after 38 years of broadcasting .   History   Early electro-mechanical system   During the late 1960s , engineers Geoff Larkby and Barry Pyatt , at the Designs Department ( Television Group ) of the BBC , worked on an experimental analogue text transmission system . Its object was to transmit a printable page of text during the nocturnal `` close-down '' period of normal television transmission . Sir Hugh Carleton Greene , then Director General of the BBC , was interested in making farming and stock-market prices available as hard copy via the dormant TV transmitters . The remit received by BBC Designs Department was `` the equivalent of one page of The Times newspaper to be transmitted during shut-down '' .   Their system employed a modified , Alexander Muirhead designed , rotating drum , facsimile transmitter , and Larkby & Pyatt 's own , unique , design of hard-copy printer . This printer used pressure-sensitive `` till-roll '' paper passing over a drum with a raised helix of steel wire .  The drum was synchronised with the transmission drum by means of the `` Start of Page '' , and `` Start of Line '' information inherent in the Muirhead system . Printing was effected by a hardened steel blade driven by , initially , a loudspeaker-type moving coil , then by a printed-circuit coil , and finally by a special ceramic piezo element manufactured by Brush-Clevite . The combination of rotating helix and oscillating moving blade , with the till-roll paper moving linearly between them , enabled a raster to be drawn on the paper .   This early electro-mechanical system was nicknamed BEEBFAX – `` Beeb '' was the contemporary popular name for the BBC , and `` fax '' from the facsimile machine . Initial tests were conducted by sending scans of Christmas Cards over the internal telephone system from London to Bristol in 1969 .   The system was less than popular in the Designs Department laboratory , due to the clatter of the Muirhead facsimile , and the whining of the printer , so the project was shelved . Messrs Larkby & Pyatt went on to propose several improvements using digital technology , but the electro-mechanical system was finally scrapped in 1970 .   Fully-electronic version   The idea was later taken up again , this time in digital and on-screen form , under the new name of CEEFAX , and the new system was announced in October 1972 , and following test transmissions in 1972–74 , the Ceefax system went live on 23 September 1974 with thirty pages of information . Developed by BBC engineers who were working on ways of providing televisual subtitles for the deaf , it was the first teletext system in the world . James Redmond , the BBC 's Director of Engineering at the time , was a particular enthusiast . Other broadcasters soon took up the idea , including the Independent Broadcasting Authority ( IBA ) , who had developed the incompatible ORACLE teletext system , at around the same time . Before the Internet and the World Wide Web become popular , Ceefax pages were often the first location to report a breaking story or headline .   After technical negotiations , the two broadcasters settled in 1976 on a single standard , different from both Ceefax and ORACLE , which ultimately developed into World System Teletext , and which remained in use for analogue broadcasts until 2012 . The display format of 24 rows by 40 columns of characters was also adopted for the Prestel system .   The technology became the standard European teletext system and replaced other standards , including the Antiope system formerly used in France .   In 1983 , Ceefax started to broadcast computer programs , known as telesoftware , for the BBC Micro ( a home computer available in the United Kingdom ) . The telesoftware broadcasts stopped in 1989 . A similar idea was the French C Plus Direct satellite channel which used different , higher speed technology to broadcast PC software .   The basic technology of Ceefax has remained compatible with the 1976 unified rollout ; system elaborations since then have been made such that earlier receivers are still able to do a basic decode of pages , but will simply ignore enhanced information rather than showing corrupted data"], [415, "Our Town is a 1938 metatheatrical three-act play by American playwright Thornton Wilder . It tells the story of the fictional American small town of Grover 's Corners between 1901 and 1913 through the everyday lives of its citizens .   Throughout Wilder uses metatheatrical devices setting the play in the actual theatre where it is being performed . The main character is the stage manager of the theatre who directly addresses the audience , brings in guest lecturers , fields questions from the audience , and fills in playing some of the roles . The play is performed without a set on a mostly bare stage . With a few exceptions , the actors mime actions without the use of props .   Our Town was first performed at McCarter Theatre in Princeton , New Jersey in 1938 . It later went on to success on Broadway and won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama . It remains popular today and revivals are frequent .   Synopsis   Act I : Daily Life   The Stage Manager introduces the audience to the small town of Grover 's Corners , New Hampshire , and the people living there as a morning begins in the year 1901 . Professor Willard speaks to the audience about the history of the town . Joe Crowell delivers the paper to Doc Gibbs , Howie Newsome delivers the milk , and the Webb and Gibbs households send their children ( Emily and George , respectively ) off to school on this beautifully simple morning .   Act II : Love and Marriage   Three years have passed , and George and Emily prepare to wed . The day is filled with stress . Howie Newsome is delivering milk in the pouring rain while Si Crowell , younger brother of Joe , laments how George 's baseball talents will be squandered . George pays an awkward visit to his soon-to-be in-laws . Here , the Stage Manager interrupts the scene and takes the audience back a year , to the end of Emily and George 's junior year . Emily confronts George about his pride , and over an ice cream soda , they discuss the future and their love for each other . George resolves not to go to college , as he had planned , but to work and eventually take over his uncle 's farm . In the present , George and Emily say that they are not ready to marry—George to his mother , Emily to her father—but they both calm down and happily go through with the wedding .   Act III : Death and Dying   Nine years have passed . The Stage Manager opens the act with a lengthy monologue emphasizing eternity , bringing the audience 's attention to the cemetery outside of town and the characters who have died since the wedding , including Mrs. Gibbs ( pneumonia , while traveling ) , Wally Webb ( burst appendix , while camping ) , Mrs. Soames , and Simon Stimson ( suicide by hanging ) . Town undertaker Joe Stoddard is introduced , as is a young man named Sam Craig who has returned to Grover 's Corners for his cousin 's funeral . That cousin is Emily , who died giving birth to her and George 's second child . Once the funeral ends , Emily emerges to join the dead ; Mrs. Gibbs urges her to forget her life , but she refuses . Ignoring the warnings of Simon , Mrs. Soames , and Mrs. Gibbs , Emily returns to Earth to relive one day , her 12th birthday . The memory proves too painful for her , and she realizes that every moment of life should be treasured . When she asks the Stage Manager if anyone truly understands the value of life while they live it , he responds , `` No . The saints and poets , maybe—they do some . '' Emily returns to her grave next to Mrs. Gibbs and watches impassively as George kneels weeping over her . The Stage Manager concludes the play and wishes the audience a good night .   Characters   ; :  * Stage Manager – a narrator , commentator , and guide through Grover 's Corners . He joins in the action of the play periodically , as the minister at the wedding , the soda shop owner , a local townsmen , etc. , and speaks directly to Emily after her death .  * Emily Webb – one of the main characters ; we follow her from a precocious young girl through her wedding to George Gibbs and her early death ."], [416, "John Marwood Cleese ( ; born 27 October 1939 ) is an English actor , comedian , writer , and film producer . He achieved success at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and as a scriptwriter and performer on The Frost Report . In the late 1960s , he co-founded Monty Python , the comedy troupe responsible for the sketch show Monty Python 's Flying Circus and the four Monty Python films : And Now for Something Completely Different , Monty Python and the Holy Grail , Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life .   In the mid-1970s , Cleese and his first wife , Connie Booth , co-wrote and starred in the British sitcom Fawlty Towers . Later , he co-starred with Kevin Kline , Jamie Lee Curtis and former Python colleague Michael Palin in A Fish Called Wanda and Fierce Creatures , both of which he also wrote . He also starred in Clockwise , and has appeared in many other films , including two James Bond films as R and Q , two Harry Potter films , and the last three Shrek films .   With Yes Minister writer Antony Jay he co-founded Video Arts , a production company making entertaining training films . In 1976 , Cleese co-founded The Secret Policeman 's Ball benefit shows to raise funds for the human rights organisation Amnesty International .   Biography   Early life and education   Cleese was born in Weston-super-Mare , Somerset , England , the only child of Reginald Francis Cleese ( 1893-1972 ) , an insurance salesman , and his wife Muriel Evelyn ( née Cross ) ( 1899-2000 ) . His family 's surname was originally Cheese , but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the Army during World War I .   As a child , Cleese supported Bristol City Football Club and Somerset County Cricket Club . Cleese was educated at St Peter 's Preparatory School , where he received a prize for English studies and did well at cricket and boxing . When he was 13 , he was awarded an exhibition at Clifton College , an English public school in Bristol . He was already more than 6 feet ( 1.83 m ) tall by then . He allegedly defaced the school grounds , as a prank , by painting footprints to suggest that the statue of Field Marshal Earl Haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet . Cleese played cricket in the First XI and did well academically , passing 8 O-Levels and 3 A-Levels in mathematics , physics , and chemistry . In his autobiography So , Anyway he says that discovering , aged 17 , he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster , Billy Williams , affected his outlook . 'It was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect ... I believe that this moment changed my perspective on the world . ’   He could not go straight to Cambridge University as the ending of conscription in the United Kingdom meant there were twice the usual number of applicants for places , so he returned to his prep school for two years to teach science , English , geography , history and Latin ( he drew on his Latin teaching experience later for a scene in Life of Brian , in which he corrects Brian 's badly written Latin graffiti ) . He then took up a place he had won at Downing College , Cambridge to read Law . He also joined the Cambridge Footlights . He recalled that he went to the Cambridge Guildhall , where each university society had a stall , and went up to the Footlights stall where he was asked if he could sing or dance . He replied `` no '' as he was not allowed to sing at his school because he was so bad , and if there was anything worse than his singing it was his dancing . He was then asked `` Well , what do you do ? `` , to which he replied , `` I make people laugh '' .   At the Footlights theatrical club he spent a lot of time with Tim Brooke-Taylor and Bill Oddie and met his future writing partner Graham Chapman . Cleese wrote extra material for the 1961 Footlights Revue I Thought I Saw It Move , and was Registrar for the Footlights Club during 1962 . He was also in the cast of the 1962 Footlights Revue Double Take !   Cleese graduated from Cambridge in 1963 with a 2:1 .

Marx aimed to reveal the economic patterns underpinning the capitalist mode of production , in contrast to classical political economists such as Adam Smith , David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill .   Themes   In Capital : Critique of Political Economy ( 1867 ) , Karl Marx proposes that the motivating force of capitalism is in the exploitation of labour , whose unpaid work is the ultimate source of surplus value and then profit both of which concepts have a specific meaning for Marx . The employer is able to claim the right to profits because he or she owns the productive capital assets ( means of production ) , which are legally protected by the capitalist state through property rights ( the historical section shows how this right was acquired in the first place chiefly through plunder and conquest and the activity of the merchant and 'middle-man ' ) . In producing capital ( money ) as well as commodities ( goods and services ) , the workers continually reproduce the economic conditions by which they labour . Capital proposes an explanation of the `` laws of motion '' of the capitalist economic system , from its origins throughout its future , by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital , the growth of wage labour , the transformation of the workplace , the concentration of capital , commercial competition , the banking system , the decline of the profit rate , land-rents , et cetera .   The critique of the political economy of capitalism proposes that :  * The commodity is the basic `` cell-form '' ( trade unit ) of a capitalist society , but capitalism is distinguished from other forms of production based on commodities in that here labour power becomes a commodity like any other . Moreover , because commerce , as a human activity , implied no morality beyond that required to buy and sell goods and services , the growth of the market system made discrete entities of the economic , the moral , and the legal spheres of human activity in society ; hence , subjective moral value is separate from objective economic value . Subsequently , political economy — the just distribution of wealth and `` political arithmetick '' about taxes — became three discrete fields of human activity : Economics , Law , and Ethics , politics and economics divorced .  * `` The economic formation of society [ is ] a process of natural history '' , thus it is possible for a political economist to objectively study the scientific laws of capitalism , given that its expansion of the market system of commerce had objectified human economic relations ; the use of money ( cash nexus ) voided religious and political illusions about its economic value , and replaced them with commodity fetishism , the belief that an object ( commodity ) has inherent economic value . Because societal economic formation is a historical process , no one person could control or direct it , thereby creating a global complex of social connections among capitalists ; thus , the economic formation ( individual commerce ) of a society precedes the human administration of an economy ( organised commerce ) .  * The structural contradictions of a capitalist economy , the gegensätzliche Bewegung , describe the contradictory movement originating from the two-fold character of labour , and so the class struggle between labour and capital , the wage labourer and the owner of the means of production . These capitalist economic contradictions operate `` behind the backs '' of the capitalists and the workers , as a result of their activities , and yet remain beyond their immediate perceptions as men and women and as social classes .  * The economic crises ( recession , depression , etc . ) that are rooted in the contradictory character of the economic value of the commodity ( cell-unit ) of a capitalist society , are the conditions that propitiate proletarian revolution ; which the Communist Manifesto ( 1848 ) collectively identified as a weapon , forged by the capitalists , which the working class `` turned against the bourgeoisie , itself '' .  * In a capitalist economy , technological improvement and its consequent increased production augment the amount of material wealth ( use value ) in society , whilst simultaneously diminishing the economic value of the same wealth , thereby diminishing the rate of profit — a paradox characteristic of economic crisis in a capitalist economy ; `` poverty in the midst"], [418, "Test cricket is the longest form of the sport of cricket and is considered its highest standard . Test matches are played between national representative teams with `` Test status '' , as determined by the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) . The two teams of 11 players play a four-innings match , which may last up to five days ( or longer in some historical cases ) . It is generally considered the most complete examination of teams ' playing ability and endurance . The origin of the name Test stems from the long , gruelling match being a `` test '' of the relative strength of the two sides .   The first officially recognised Test match began on 15 March 1877 , between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) , where Australia won by 45 runs . A Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket was held in Melbourne from 12 to 17 March 1977 , in which Australia beat England by 45 runs—the same margin as that first Test .   In October 2012 , the International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches , permitting day/night Test matches . The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval , Adelaide , on 27 November 2015 .   Test status   Test matches are the highest level of cricket although , statistically , their data forms part of first-class cricket . Matches are played between national representative teams with `` Test status '' , as determined by the International Cricket Council . , ten national teams have Test status , the most recently promoted being Bangladesh in 2000 . Zimbabwe 's Test status was voluntarily suspended , because of poor performances between 2006 and 2011 ; it returned to competition in August 2011 .   In January 2014 , during the historic ICC meeting in Dubai , the pathway for new potential test nations was laid out with the winners of the next round of the ICC Intercontinental Cup playing a 5-day match against the bottom rank test nation . If the Associate team defeats the test nation , then they could be added as the new test country and be given full membership .   A list of matches , defined as `` Tests '' , was first drawn up by Australian Clarence Moody in the mid-1890s . Representative matches played by simultaneous England touring sides of 1891–92 ( in Australia and South Africa ) and 1929–30 ( in the West Indies and New Zealand ) are deemed to have `` Test status '' .   In 1970 , a series of five `` Test matches '' was played in England between England and a Rest of the World XI . These matches , originally scheduled between England and South Africa , were amended after South Africa was suspended from international cricket because of their government 's policy of apartheid . Although initially given Test status ( and included as Test matches in some record books , including Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack ) , this was later withdrawn and a principle was established that official Test matches can only be between nations ( although the geographically and demographically small countries of the West Indies have since 1928 been permitted to field a coalition side ) . Despite this , in 2005 , the ICC ruled that the six-day Super Series match that took place in October 2005 , between Australia and a World XI , was an official Test match . Some cricket writers and statisticians , including Bill Frindall , ignored the ICC 's ruling and excluded the 2005 match from their records . The series of `` Test matches '' played in Australia between Australia and a World XI in 1971/72 do not have Test status . The commercial `` Supertests '' organised by Kerry Packer as part of his World Series Cricket enterprise and played between `` WSC Australia '' , `` WSC World XI '' and `` WSC West Indies '' from 1977 to 1979 have never been regarded as official Test matches .   Test cricket playing teams   There are currently ten Test-playing teams , representing individual nations except for England and the West Indies . Test status is conferred upon a country or group of countries by the International Cricket Council . Teams that do not have Test status can play in the ICC Intercontinental Cup , specifically designed to allow non-Test teams to play under conditions similar to Tests .

The genre has also been described as possessing `` a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years '' . This view sees the novel 's origins in Classical Greece and Rome , medieval , early modern romance , and the tradition of the novella . The latter , an Italian word used to describe short stories , supplied the present generic English term in the 18th century . Ian Watt , however , in The Rise of the Novel ( 1957 ) suggests that the novel first came into being in the early 18th century ,   Miguel de Cervantes , author of Don Quixote , is frequently cited as the first significant European novelist of the modern era ; the first part of Don Quixote was published in 1605 .   The romance is a closely related long prose narrative . Walter Scott defined it as `` a fictitious narrative in prose or verse ; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents '' , whereas in the novel `` the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society '' . However , many romances , including the historical romances of Scott , Emily Brontë 's Wuthering Heights and Herman Melville 's Moby-Dick , are also frequently called novels , and Scott describes romance as a `` kindred term '' . Romance , as defined here , should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or romance novel . Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel : `` a novel is le roman , der Roman , il romanzo . ''   Defining the genre   A novel is a long , fictional narrative which describes intimate human experiences . The novel in the modern era usually makes use of a literary prose style , and the development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in printing , and the introduction of cheap paper , in the 15th century .   The present English ( and Spanish ) word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian novella for `` new '' , `` news '' , or `` short story of something new '' , itself from the Latin novella , a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus , diminutive of novus , meaning `` new '' . Most European languages use the word `` romance '' ( as in French , Dutch , Russian , Serbo-Croatian , Romanian , Danish , Swedish and Norwegian `` roman '' ; German `` Roman '' ; Portuguese `` romance '' and Italian `` romanzo '' ) for extended narratives .   A fictional narrative   Fictionality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from historiography . However this can be a problematic criterion . Throughout the early modern period authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion . Historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes . Novels can , on the other hand , depict the social , political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history .   Literary prose   While prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel , the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the Romance language of southern France , especially those by Chrétien de Troyes ( late 12th century ) , and in Middle English ( Geoffrey Chaucer 's ( c. 1343 – 1400 ) The Canterbury Tales ) . Even in the 19th century , fictional narratives in verse , such as Lord Byron 's Don Juan ( 1824 ) , Alexander Pushkin 's Yevgeniy Onegin ( 1833 ) , and Elizabeth Barrett Browning 's Aurora Leigh ( 1856 ) , competed with prose novels . Vikram Seth 's The Golden Gate ( 1986 ) , composed of 590 Onegin stanzas , is a more recent example of the verse novel .   Content : intimate experience   Both in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe , prose fiction created intimate reading situations . On the other hand , verse epics , including the Odyssey and Aeneid , had been recited to a select audiences , though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters .

He attended Beauchamps High School , a secondary school and sixth form college , from 1979 to 1986 . Coulson 's parents moved from their Basildon council house to nearby Wickford during his childhood .   Career   Coulson started work at 18 as a junior reporter on the Basildon Echo in 1986 . In 1988 , he moved to The Sun , working with Piers Morgan on the showbiz column Bizarre . In 1994 , he briefly moved to the Daily Mail , but after nine weeks moved back to The Sun to edit Bizarre . He hired Dominic Mohan , who was later promoted to editor .   He set up the website page3.com , which was the first of News International 's websites to make a profit .   News of the World   He became deputy editor of the News of the World , the Sunday sister paper of The Sun , in 2000 .  In 2001 , in the run up to the general election , he asked Tony and Cherie Blair whether they were members of the mile high club .  Coulson replaced Rebekah Wade as editor in 2003 . In an interview with the Press Gazette in 2005 , he said that `` Tabloid newspapers in this country do more for its people than any other newspapers in the world '' .   Coulson resigned on 26 January 2007 over the News of the World phone hacking affair which would several weeks later see the jailing for four months of the paper 's Royal correspondent Clive Goodman . Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire , remunerated by the newspaper , was given a custodial sentence of six months .   On 21 July 2009 Coulson appeared in front of the House of Commons Culture , Media and Sport Select Committee and denied any knowledge of the phone hacking scandal , saying `` my instructions to the staff were clear – we did not use subterfuge of any kind unless there was a clear public interest in doing so . They were to work within the PCC code at all times '' .   In 2008 an employment tribunal upheld a claim of bullying by Coulson whilst he was at the News of The World . A Stratford employment tribunal upheld a claim of unfair dismissal claimed by senior sports writer Matt Driscoll , and stated `` We find the behaviour to have been a consistent pattern of bullying behaviour '' . The judgement singled out Coulson for making `` bullying '' remarks in an email to Driscoll . The paper was told"], [422, "A camel is an even-toed ungulate within the genus Camelus , bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as `` humps '' on its back . The two surviving species of camel are the dromedary , or one-humped camel ( C. dromedarius ) , which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa ; and the Bactrian , or two-humped camel ( C. bactrianus ) , which inhabits Central Asia . Both species have been domesticated ; they provide milk , meat , hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches , and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads .   The term camel is derived via Latin and Greek ( camelus and κάμηλος kamēlos respectively ) from Hebrew or Phoenician gāmāl .   `` Camel '' is also used more broadly to describe any of the six camel-like mammals in the family Camelidae : the two true camels and the four New World camelids : the llama , alpaca , guanaco , and vicuña of South America .   Biology   The average life expectancy of a camel is 40 to 50 years . A full-grown adult camel stands at the shoulder and at the hump . Camels can run at up to 65 km/h in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to 40 km/h . Bactrian camels weigh 300 to and dromedaries 300 to .   The male dromedary camel has in its throat an organ called a dulla , a large , inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in rut to assert dominance and attract females . It resembles a long , swollen , pink tongue hanging out of the side of its mouth . Camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground , with the male mounting from behind . The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session . Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position .   Ecological and behavioral adaptations   Camels do not directly store water in their humps as was once commonly believed . The humps are actually reservoirs of fatty tissue : concentrating body fat in their humps minimizes the insulating effect fat would have if distributed over the rest of their bodies , helping camels survive in hot climates . When this tissue is metabolized , it yields more than one gram of water for every gram of fat processed . This fat metabolization , while releasing energy , causes water to evaporate from the lungs during respiration ( as oxygen is required for the metabolic process ) : overall , there is a net decrease in water .   Camels have a series of physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand long periods of time without any external source of water . Unlike other mammals , their red blood cells are oval rather than circular in shape . This facilitates the flow of red blood cells during dehydration and makes them better at withstanding high osmotic variation without rupturing when drinking large amounts of water : a 600 kg camel can drink 200 L of water in three minutes .   Camels are able to withstand changes in body temperature and water consumption that would kill most other animals . Their temperature ranges from 34 °C at dawn and steadily increases to 40 °C by sunset , before they cool off at night again . Maintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for animals ; to assist this , camels have a rete mirabile , a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain . Camels rarely sweat , even when ambient temperatures reach 49 °C . Any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat ; the heat of vaporization therefore comes from body heat rather than ambient heat . Camels can withstand losing 25 % of their body weight to sweating , whereas most other mammals can withstand only about 12–14 % dehydration before cardiac failure results from circulatory disturbance .   When the camel exhales , water vapor becomes trapped in their nostrils and is reabsorbed into the body as a means to conserve water . Camels eating green herbage can ingest sufficient moisture in milder conditions to maintain their bodies ' hydrated state without the need for drinking .   The camels ' thick coats insulate them from the intense heat radiated from desert sand ; a shorn camel must sweat 50 % more to avoid overheating . During the summer the coat becomes lighter in"], [423, "Troy ( , Troia and , Ilion , or , Ilios ; and ; Trōia is the typical Latin name for the city . Ilium is a more poetic term : Hittite : Wilusa or Truwisa ; ) was a city situated in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor , now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey , near ( just south of ) the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles straits and northwest of Mount Ida . The present-day location is known as Hisarlık . It was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle , in particular in the Iliad , one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer . Metrical evidence from the Iliad and the Odyssey suggests that the name ( Ilion ) formerly began with a digamma : ( Wilion ) ; this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city , Wilusa .   A new capital called Ilium was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus . It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople and declined gradually in the Byzantine era .   In 1865 , English archaeologist Frank Calvert excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarlık , and in 1868 , Heinrich Schliemann , a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist , also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in Çanakkale . These excavations revealed several cities built in succession . Schliemann was at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy , but was persuaded by Calvert and took over Calvert 's excavations on the eastern half of the Hisarlik site , which was on Calvert 's property . Troy VII has been identified with the Hittite city Wilusa , the probable origin of the Greek Ἴλιον , and is generally ( but not conclusively ) identified with Homeric Troy .   Today , the hill at Hisarlık has given its name to a small village near the ruins , which supports the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site . It lies within the province of Çanakkale , some 30 km south-west of the provincial capital , also called Çanakkale . The nearest village is Tevfikiye . The map here shows the adapted Scamander estuary with Ilium a little way inland across the Homeric plain .   Troy was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998 .   Homeric Troy   Ancient Greek historians variously placed the Trojan War in the 12th , 13th , or 14th centuries BC : Eratosthenes to 1184 BC , Herodotus to 1250 BC , Duris of Samos to 1334 BC . Modern archaeologists associate Homeric Troy with archaeological Troy VII .   In the Iliad , the Achaeans set up their camp near the mouth of the River Scamander ( presumably modern Karamenderes ) , where they had beached their ships . The city of Troy itself stood on a hill , across the plain of Scamander , where the battles of the Trojan War took place . The site of the ancient city is some 5 km from the coast today , but 3,000 years ago the mouths of Scamander were much closer to the city , discharging into a large bay that formed a natural harbour and which has since been filled with alluvial material . Recent geological findings have permitted the identification of the ancient Trojan coastline , and the results largely confirm the accuracy of the Homeric geography of Troy .   In November 2001 , the geologist John C. Kraft from the University of Delaware and the classicist John V. Luce from Trinity College , Dublin , presented the results of investigations , begun in 1977 , into the geology of the region . They compared the present geology with the landscapes and coastal features described in the Iliad and other classical sources , notably Strabo 's Geographia , and concluded that there is a regular consistency between the location of Schliemann 's Troy and other locations such as the Greek camp , the geological evidence , descriptions of the topography and accounts of the battle in the Iliad .   Besides the Iliad , there are references to Troy in the other major work attributed to Homer , the Odyssey , as well as in other ancient Greek literature ( such as Aeschylus ' Oresteia ) . The Homeric legend of Troy was elaborated by the Roman poet Virgil in his Aeneid . The Greeks and Romans took for a fact the historicity of the Trojan War and the"], [424, "In biology , a species ( abbreviated sp. , with the plural form species abbreviated spp . ) is one of the basic units of biological classification and a taxonomic rank . A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals are capable of reproducing fertile offspring , typically using sexual reproduction . While in many cases this definition is adequate , the difficulty of defining species is known as the species problem . For example , a species complex is a group of closely related species that are very similar in appearance to the point that the boundaries between them are often unclear . Differentiating measures include similarity of DNA , morphology , or ecological niche . Presence of specific locally adapted traits may further subdivide species into `` infraspecific taxa '' such as subspecies ( and in botany other taxa are used , such as varieties , subvarieties , and formae ) .   Species hypothesized to have the same ancestors are placed in one genus , based on similarities . The similarity of species is judged based on comparison of physical attributes , and where available , their DNA sequences . All species are given a two-part name , a `` binomial name '' , or just `` binomial '' . The first part of a binomial is the generic name , the genus to which the species belongs . The second part is either called the specific name ( a term used only in zoology ) or the specific epithet ( the term used in botany , which can also be used in zoology ) . For example , Boa constrictor is one of four species of the Boa genus . While the genus gets capitalized , the specific epithet does not . The binomial is written in italics when printed and underlined when handwritten .   A usable definition of the word `` species '' and reliable methods of identifying particular species are essential for stating and testing biological theories and for measuring biodiversity , though other taxonomic levels such as families may be considered in broad-scale studies . Extinct species known only from fossils are generally difficult to assign precise taxonomic rankings , which is why higher taxonomic levels such as families are often used for fossil-based studies .   The total number of non-bacterial and non-archaeal species in the world has been estimated at 8.7 million , with previous estimates ranging from two million to 100 million .   History and development of the concept   In the earliest works of science , a species was simply an individual organism that represented a group of similar or nearly identical organisms . No other relationships beyond that group were implied . Aristotle used the words genus and species to mean generic and specific categories . Aristotle and other pre-Darwinian scientists took the species to be distinct and unchanging , with an `` essence '' , like the chemical elements . When early observers began to develop systems of organization for living things , they began to place formerly isolated species into a context . Many of these early delineation schemes would now be considered whimsical and these included consanguinity based on color ( all plants with yellow flowers ) or behavior ( snakes , scorpions and certain biting ants ) .   John Ray ( 1686 ) , an English naturalist , was the first to give a biological definition of the term `` species , '' as follows :  `` ... no surer criterion for determining species has occurred to me than the distinguishing features that perpetuate themselves in propagation from seed . Thus , no matter what variations occur in the individuals or the species , if they spring from the seed of one and the same plant , they are accidental variations and not such as to distinguish a species ... Animals likewise that differ specifically preserve their distinct species permanently ; one species never springs from the seed of another nor vice versa '' .   In the 18th century Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus classified organisms according to shared physical characteristics , and not simply based upon differences . He also established the idea of a taxonomic hierarchy of classification based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships . At the time , however , it was still widely believed that there was no organic connection between species , no matter how similar they appeared . This view was influenced by European scholarly and religious education at the time , which held that the categories of life are dictated by God , in a hierarchical scheme . Although there are always differences ( although"], [425, "Manitoba is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada . It is one of the three prairie provinces ( with Alberta and Saskatchewan ) and Canada 's fifth-most populous province with its estimated population of about 1.3 million people . Manitoba covers 649950 km2 with a widely varied landscape . The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south .   Aboriginal peoples have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years . In the late 17th century , fur traders arrived in the area when it was part of Rupert 's Land and owned by the Hudson 's Bay Company . In 1867 , negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba led to an armed uprising of the Métis people against the Government of Canada , a conflict known as the Red River Rebellion . The resolution of the rebellion led to the Parliament of Canada passing the Manitoba Act in 1870 , officially creating the province of Manitoba .   Manitoba 's capital and largest city , Winnipeg , is Canada 's eighth-largest Census Metropolitan Area . Winnipeg is the seat of government , home to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and the Provincial Court . Four of the province 's five universities and all four of its professional sports teams are in Winnipeg .  Other cities in the province are Brandon , Portage la Prairie , Steinbach , Thompson , Winkler , Selkirk , Dauphin , Morden , and Flin Flon .   Etymology   The name Manitoba is believed to be derived from the Cree , Ojibwe or Assiniboine languages . The name derives from Cree manitou-wapow or Ojibwa manidoobaa , both meaning `` straits of Manitou , the Great Spirit '' , a place referring to what are now called The Narrows in the centre of Lake Manitoba . It may also be from the Assiniboine for `` Lake of the Prairie '' .   The lake was known to French explorers as Lac des Prairies . Thomas Spence chose the name to refer to a new republic he proposed for the area south of the lake . Métis leader Louis Riel also chose the name , and it was accepted in Ottawa under the Manitoba Act of 1870 .   Geography   Manitoba is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west , the territories of Nunavut to the north , and Northwest Territories to the northwest , and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south . It adjoins Hudson Bay to the northeast , and is the only prairie province to have a saltwater coastline . The Port of Churchill is the only arctic deep-water port in Canada and the shortest shipping route between North America and Asia . Lake Winnipeg is the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world . Hudson Bay is the second-largest bay in the world . Manitoba is at the heart of the giant Hudson Bay watershed , once known as Rupert 's Land . It was a vital area of the Hudson 's Bay Company , with many rivers and lakes that provided excellent opportunities for the lucrative fur trade .   Hydrography and terrain   The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and contains over 110,000 lakes , covering approximately 15.6 percent or 101593 km2 of its surface area . Manitoba 's major lakes are Lake Manitoba , Lake Winnipegosis , and Lake Winnipeg , the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world . Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on the east side of Lake Winnipeg are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site .   Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin , with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay . This basin 's rivers reach far west to the mountains , far south into the United States , and east into Ontario . Major watercourses include the Red , Assiniboine , Nelson , Winnipeg , Hayes , Whiteshell and Churchill rivers . Most of Manitoba 's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz . This region , particularly the Red River Valley , is flat and fertile ; there are hilly and rocky areas throughout the province left by receding glaciers .   Baldy Mountain is the province 's highest point at 832 m above sea level ,"], [426, "The Soham murders occurred in Soham , Cambridgeshire , England , on 4 August 2002 . The victims were two 10-year-old girls , Holly Marie Wells and Jessica Aimee Chapman . Their bodies were found near RAF Lakenheath , Suffolk , on 17 August 2002 , by a local farm worker .   Ian Kevin Huntley , a caretaker at local secondary school Soham Village College , was convicted on 17 December 2003 of the girls ' murder and sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment , with the High Court later setting a minimum term of 40 years .   His girlfriend , Maxine Ann Carr , was the girls ' teaching assistant at St Andrew 's Primary School . Carr had provided Huntley with a false alibi and received a three-and-a-half year prison sentence for perverting the course of justice .   Murders   On Sunday , 4 August 2002 , Wells and Chapman had attended a barbecue at Wells ' home in Redhouse Gardens , Soham . At around 6:15 pm , they went out to buy some sweets . On their way back they walked past the home of Ian Huntley , a secondary school caretaker , in College Close . Huntley saw the girls and asked them to come into his house . He said that his girlfriend , Maxine Carr , their teaching assistant at St Andrew 's Primary School , was in the house too . She had in fact gone to visit family in Grimsby , Lincolnshire . Shortly after the girls entered his house , Huntley murdered them .   Huntley 's motive for killing Wells and Chapman may never be known , but minutes before seeing them he had reportedly slammed the telephone down on Carr following a furious argument ; Huntley had allegedly suspected Carr of cheating on him . The police suspected that Huntley killed the girls in a fit of jealous rage . Huntley 's mother also said that she suspected this . The police found no evidence of premeditation .   Investigation   After the girls were reported missing , the police released photographs – taken only hours before their disappearance – of them wearing Manchester United replica football shirts and a physical description of each of them , describing them as `` white , about 4 ft 6 in tall and slim '' .   Meanwhile , over the next two weeks , Huntley appeared in several television interviews on Sky News and the BBC 's regional news programme Look East , speaking of the shock in the local community . One reporter suggested to Huntley that he may have been the last person to speak to the girls before they disappeared , to which Huntley replied : `` Yeah , that 's what it seems like . '' Huntley said their disappearance was `` absolutely '' a mystery and , during the second week of the search , he told television crews that `` while there 's no news there 's still that glimmer of hope , and that 's basically what we 're all hanging on to . ''   In the early days of the investigation , a woman living in the nearby village of Little Thetford claimed to have seen two girls whose appearance and clothing matched those of Wells and Chapman walking past her home on the morning after they were reported missing . Police also seized a white van from a caravan park in Wentworth , some 10 miles from Soham , on 7 August .   Police received information from a local taxi driver that the driver of a green car ( either a Peugeot 405 or Vauxhall Vectra ) was seen struggling with two children and driving `` erratically '' south of Soham and onto the Studlands Park housing estate in Newmarket on the evening the girls went missing . This sighting was made public on 13 August . That evening , a dog walker alerted police to two mounds of earth at Warren Hill , just outside Newmarket . The suggestion was that these might be the graves of the two missing girls . However , an overnight examination revealed that the mounds of earth were badger setts , and no trace of either girl was found .   Around the same time , police in Staffordshire claimed that the disappearance of the girls was linked to an abduction in the county the previous year , where a six-year-old girl had survived an attack by an abductor who was still at large and whose green Ford Mondeo was identified as having numberplates which had been stolen in Peterborough . The same man was also believed"], [427, "Vikings is an Irish-Canadian historical drama television series written and created by Michael Hirst for the television channel History . Filmed in Ireland , it premiered on March 3 , 2013 in Canada and the United States .   Vikings is inspired by the sagas of Viking Ragnar Lothbrok , one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of England and France . The show portrays Ragnar as a farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England , and eventually becomes a Scandinavian King , with the support of his family and fellow warriors : his brother Rollo , his son Bjorn Ironside , and his wives—the shieldmaiden Lagertha and the princess Aslaug .   Vikings was renewed for a fourth season in March 2015 with an extended order of 20 episodes , which premiered on February 18 , 2016 . On March 17 , 2016 , History renewed Vikings for a fifth season of 20 episodes .   Premise   The series is inspired by the tales of the raiding , trading , and exploring Norsemen of early medieval Scandinavia . It follows the exploits of the legendary Viking chieftain Ragnar Lothbrok and his crew and family , as notably laid down in the 13th century sagas Ragnars saga Loðbrókar and Ragnarssona þáttr , as well as in Saxo Grammaticus 's 12th century work Gesta Danorum . Norse legendary sagas were partially fictional tales based in Norse oral tradition , written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe . Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period , such as records of the Viking raid on Lindisfarne depicted in the second episode , or Ahmad ibn Fadlan 's 10th-century account of the Volga Vikings . The series is set at the beginning of the Viking Age , marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793 .

Michael Hirst , Morgan O'Sullivan , John Weber , Sherry Marsh , Alan Gasmer , James Flynn and Sheila Hockin are credited as executive producers . The first season 's budget has been reported as $ 40 million USD .   The series began filming in July 2012 at Ashford Studios , a newly built studio facility in Ireland , chosen as a location for its tax advantages . On August 16 , 2012 , longship scenes were filmed at Luggala , as well as on the Poulaphouca Reservoir , in the heart of the Wicklow Mountains . 70 percent of the first season was filmed outdoors . Some additional background shots were done in western Norway .   Johan Renck , Ciarán Donnelly and Ken Girotti each directed three episodes . The production team includes cinematographer John Bartley , costume designer Joan Bergin , production designer Tom Conroy , composer Trevor Morris and Irish choir Crux Vocal Ensemble , directed by Paul McGough .   According to actor Clive Standen ( Rollo ) , future seasons may feature characters such as Alfred the Great , Leif Ericson , and Ivar the Boneless , as well as travels to Iceland , Russia , France , and across the Atlantic .

Rosario Dawson , Woody Harrelson , and Barry Pepper also star . The film was released in theaters in the United States and Canada on December 19 , 2008 , by Columbia Pictures . Despite receiving negative reviews , it was a box office success , grossing US $ 168,168,201 worldwide .   Plot   Tim Thomas ( Will Smith ) , while carelessly sending a text message while driving , veers across the center line into oncoming traffic and causes a multi-car crash in which seven people die : six strangers and his fiancée , Sarah Jenson ( Robinne Lee ) .   Two years later , in a bid for atonement , Tim sets out to save the lives of seven good people by donating his own vital organs , a process that will be completed after his planned suicide . A year after the crash , having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer , Tim donates a lung lobe to his brother Ben ( Michael Ealy ) , an IRS field agent . Tim then steals his brother 's federal IRS identification badge and credentials , puts his picture over Tim 's , identifies himself by his brother 's name , and uses Ben 's privileges to check out the financial backgrounds of further potential candidates for his donations . In each case he `` interviews '' them first to determine if they are good people .   In one case , the director of a hospice nursing home facility , who had an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant , seeks a six-month extension on his back taxes . Tim , now going by his brother 's name , is unsure of the man 's ethics , because he claims to be insolvent , yet drives a new BMW . To resolve the issue , `` Ben '' passionately asks a resident patient , an elderly bedridden woman , to tell him whether he is a `` good man '' , only to discover that the man is punishing the woman for refusing to take a new medication by not allowing the nurses to bathe her .   Six months later , `` Ben '' donates part of his liver to a Child Protective Services social worker named Holly ( Judyann Elder ) . He then finds George ( Bill Smitrovich ) , a junior hockey coach and donates a kidney to him . He then donates bone marrow to a young boy named Nicholas ( Quintin Kelley ) , opting to have no anesthesia during the procedure , an evident consequence of his desire for atonement . In each case he does not tell the people what his intentions are for his donations , despite being repeatedly asked .   Two weeks before he dies , he contacts Holly and asks if she knows anyone `` in the system '' who needs and deserves help but is too proud to ask for it . Holly suggests Connie Tepos ( Elpidia Carrillo ) , who lives with her two kids and an abusive boyfriend , but ca n't afford to leave . When `` Ben '' arrives to `` interview '' her under the guise of dealing with the IRS , Connie is embarrassed and humiliated that he knows what 's been going on . She defends her boyfriend , is offended by `` Ben '' 's suggestion that she should leave with her kids , and kicks him out of her house . In the meantime , `` Ben '' moves out of his house and into a local motel , taking with him his pet box jellyfish—decidedly the most venomous creature on earth , with its sting causing death in three to five minutes . That night , after being beaten by her boyfriend again , Connie contacts `` Ben '' . He meets her , tells her not to be weak , and gives her the keys and directions to his beach house . She takes her two children and they move into the house . Then she reads a letter from `` Ben '' which includes the deed to the house , again giving no explanation , and asking for her to ( 1 ) respect his wishes , ( 2 ) not try to contact him , ( 3 ) not tell anyone how she got the house , and ( 4 ) `` live life abundantly '' .   `` Ben '' 's sixth candidate is Ezra Turner ( Woody Harrelson"], [429, "Cardiff ( ; ) is the capital and largest city in Wales and the tenth largest city in the United Kingdom . The city is the country 's chief commercial centre , the base for most national cultural and sporting institutions , the Welsh national media , and the seat of the National Assembly for Wales . The unitary authority area 's mid-2011 population was estimated to be 346,100 , while the population of the Larger Urban Zone was estimated at 861,400 in 2009 . The Cardiff metropolitan area makes up over a third of the total population of Wales , with a mid-2011 population estimate of about 1,100,000 people . Cardiff is a significant tourist centre and the most popular visitor destination in Wales with 18.3 million visitors in 2010 . In 2011 , Cardiff was ranked sixth in the world in National Geographic 's alternative tourist destinations .   The city of Cardiff is the county town of the historic county of Glamorgan ( and later South Glamorgan ) . Cardiff is part of the Eurocities network of the largest European cities . The Cardiff Urban Area covers a slightly larger area outside the county boundary , and includes the towns of Dinas Powys and Penarth . A small town until the early 19th century , its prominence as a major port for the transport of coal following the arrival of industry in the region contributed to its rise as a major city .   Cardiff was made a city in 1905 , and proclaimed the capital of Wales in 1955 . Since the 1980s , Cardiff has seen significant development . A new waterfront area at Cardiff Bay contains the Senedd building , home to the Welsh Assembly and the Wales Millennium Centre arts complex . Current developments include the continuation of the redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay and city centre areas with projects such as the Cardiff International Sports Village , a BBC drama village , and a new business district in the city centre .   Sporting venues in the city include the Millennium Stadium ( the national stadium for the Wales national rugby union team ) , SWALEC Stadium ( the home of Glamorgan County Cricket Club ) , Cardiff City Stadium ( the home of Cardiff City football team ) , Cardiff International Sports Stadium ( the home of Cardiff Amateur Athletic Club ) and Cardiff Arms Park ( the home of Cardiff Blues and Cardiff RFC rugby union teams ) . The city was awarded the title of European City of Sport twice , due to its role in hosting major international sporting events : first in 2009 and again in 2014 . The Millennium Stadium hosted 11 football matches as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics , including the games ' opening event and the men 's bronze medal match .   Etymology   Caerdydd ( the Welsh name of the city ) derives from the earlier Welsh form Caerdyf . The change from -dyf to -dydd shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh f and dd , and was perhaps also driven by folk etymology ( dydd is Welsh for 'day ' whereas dyf has no obvious meaning ) . This sound change had probably first occurred in the Middle Ages ; both forms were current in the Tudor period . Caerdyf has its origins in post-Roman Brythonic words meaning `` the fort of the Taff '' . The fort probably refers to that established by the Romans . Caer is Welsh for fort and -dyf is in effect a form of Taf ( Taff ) , the river which flows by Cardiff Castle , with the showing consonant mutation to and the vowel showing affection as a result of a ( lost ) genitive case ending.Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan , Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales . University of Wales Press , 2007 , ISBN 1-84323-901-9 , p. 70 .   The anglicised form Cardiff is derived from Caerdyf , with the Welsh f borrowed as ff , as also happens in Taff ( from Welsh Taf ) and Llandaff ( from Welsh Llandaf ) . As English does not have the vowel the final vowel has been borrowed as /ɪ/ .   The antiquarian William Camden ( 1551–1623 ) suggested that the name Cardiff may derive from `` Caer-Didi '' ( `` the Fort of Didius '' ) , a name supposedly given in honour of Aulus Didius Gallus , governor of a nearby province at the time when the Roman fort was established . Although some sources repeat this theory , it has been rejected on linguistic grounds by modern scholars such as Professor Gwynedd Pierce .   History"], [430, "Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks , concerning their gods and heroes , the nature of the world , and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices . It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece . Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization , and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself .   Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives , and implicitly in Greek representational arts , such as vase-paintings and votive gifts . Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world , and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods , goddesses , heroes , heroines and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature .  The oldest known Greek literary sources , Homer 's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world , the succession of divine rulers , the succession of human ages , the origin of human woes , and the origin of sacrificial practices . Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC , in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias .   Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology , with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts . Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods , Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear , supplementing the existing literary evidence . Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture , arts , and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language . Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered contemporary significance and relevance in the themes .   Sources   Greek mythology is known today primarily from Greek literature and representations on visual media dating from the Geometric period from c. 900–800 BC onward . In fact , literary and archaeological sources integrate , sometimes mutually supportive and sometimes in conflict ; however , in many cases , the existence of this corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots .   Literary sources   Mythical narration plays an important role in nearly every genre of Greek literature . Nevertheless , the only general mythographical handbook to survive from Greek antiquity was the Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus . This work attempts to reconcile the contradictory tales of the poets and provides a grand summary of traditional Greek mythology and heroic legends . Apollodorus of Athens lived from c. 180–125 BC and wrote on many of these topics . His writings may have formed the basis for the collection ; however the `` Library '' discusses events that occurred long after his death , hence the name Pseudo-Apollodorus .   Among the earliest literary sources are Homer 's two epic poems , the Iliad and the Odyssey . Other poets completed the `` epic cycle '' , but these later and lesser poems now are lost almost entirely . Despite their traditional name , the `` Homeric Hymns '' have no direct connection with Homer . They are choral hymns from the earlier part of the so-called Lyric age . Hesiod , a possible contemporary with Homer , offers in his Theogony ( Origin of the Gods ) the fullest account of the earliest Greek myths , dealing with the creation of the world ; the origin of the gods , Titans , and Giants ; as well as elaborate genealogies , folktales , and etiological myths . Hesiod 's Works and Days , a didactic poem about farming life , also includes the myths of Prometheus , Pandora , and the Five Ages . The poet gives advice on the best way to succeed in a dangerous world , rendered"], [431, "A planet is an astronomical object orbiting a star or stellar remnant that  * is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity ,  * is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion , and  * has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.This definition is drawn from two separate IAU declarations ; a formal definition agreed by the IAU in 2006 , and an informal working definition established by the IAU in 2001/2003 for objects outside of the Solar System . The official 2006 definition applies only to the Solar System , whereas the 2003 definition applies to planets around other stars . The extrasolar planet issue was deemed too complex to resolve at the 2006 IAU conference .  The term planet is ancient , with ties to history , astrology , science , mythology , and religion . Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye . These were regarded by many early cultures as divine , or as emissaries of deities . As scientific knowledge advanced , human perception of the planets changed , incorporating a number of disparate objects . In 2006 , the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System . This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit . Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain `` planets '' under the modern definition , some celestial bodies , such as Ceres , Pallas , Juno and Vesta ( each an object in the solar asteroid belt ) , and Pluto ( the first trans-Neptunian object discovered ) , that were once considered planets by the scientific community , are no longer viewed as such .   The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions . Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times , it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations , performed by Galileo Galilei . By careful analysis of the observation data , Johannes Kepler found the planets ' orbits were not circular but elliptical . As observational tools improved , astronomers saw that , like Earth , the planets rotated around tilted axes , and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons . Since the dawn of the Space Age , close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism , hurricanes , tectonics , and even hydrology .   Planets are generally divided into two main types : large low-density giant planets , and smaller rocky terrestrials . Under IAU definitions , there are eight planets in the Solar System . In order of increasing distance from the Sun , they are the four terrestrials , Mercury , Venus , Earth , and Mars , then the four giant planets , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune . Six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites .   More than two thousand planets around other stars ( `` extrasolar planets '' or `` exoplanets '' ) have been discovered in the Milky Way . As of , known extrasolar planets in planetary systems ( including multiple planetary systems ) , ranging in size from just above the size of the Moon to gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter have been discovered , out of which more than 100 planets are the same size as Earth , nine of which are at the same relative distance from their star as Earth from the Sun , i.e . in the habitable zone . On December 20 , 2011 , the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets , Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f , orbiting a Sun-like star , Kepler-20 . A 2012 study , analyzing gravitational microlensing data , estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every star in the Milky Way .  Around one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone .   History   The word `` planet '' derives from the Ancient Greek ἀστήρ πλανήτης astēr planētēs , or πλάνης ἀστήρ plánēs astēr , which means `` wandering star , '' and originally referred to those objects in the night sky that moved relative to one another , as opposed to the `` fixed stars '' , which maintained a constant relative position in the sky .   The idea of planets has evolved over its history , from the"], [432, "The cuisine of South Africa can be generalised as :   * Cookery practised by indigenous people of Africa such as the Sotho- and Nguni-speaking people .  * Cookery that emerged from several waves of colonisation and immigration introduced during the colonial period by white European people of Dutch ( since 1652 ) , German , French , Italian , Greek and British ( since 1805~1820 ) descent and their Indo-Asian slaves or servants – this includes the cuisine of the so-called Cape Malay people , which has many characteristics of Indonesia and cooking styles from neighbouring colonial cultures such as Portuguese Mozambique .   Indigenous cookery   In the precolonial period , indigenous cuisine was characterised by the use of a very wide range of foods including fruits , nuts , bulbs , leaves and other products gathered from wild plants and by the hunting of wild game . The introduction of domestic cattle and grain crops by Bantu speakers who arrived in the southern regions from central Africa since 10,000 BC and the spread of cattle keeping to Khoisan groups enabled products and the availability of fresh meat on demand . The pre-colonial diet consisted primarily of cooked grains , especially sorghum , fermented milk ( somewhat like yogurt ) and roasted or stewed meat . At some point , maize replaced sorghum as the primary grain , and there is some dispute as to whether maize , a Central American crop , arrived with European settlers ( notably the Portuguese ) or spread through Africa before white settlement via Africans returning from the Americas during the era of the slave trade . People also kept sheep and goats , and communities often organised vast hunts for the abundant game ; but beef was considered the absolutely most important and high status meat . The ribs of any cattle that were slaughtered in many communities were so prized that they were offered to the chief of the village .   In many ways , the daily food of South African families can be traced to the indigenous foods that their ancestors ate . A typical meal in a South African family household that is Bantu-speaking is a stiff , fluffy porridge of maize meal ( called `` pap , '' and very similar to American grits ) with a flavourful stewed meat gravy . Traditional rural families ( and many urban ones ) often ferment their pap for a few days – especially if it is sorghum instead of maize – which gives it a tangy flavor . The Sotho-Tswana call this fermented pap , `` ting . ''   The vegetable is often some sort of pumpkin , varieties of which are indigenous to South Africa , although now many people eat pumpkins that originated in other countries . Rice and beans are also very popular even though they are not indigenous . Another common vegetable dish , which arrived in South Africa with its many Irish immigrants , but which has been adopted by South Africans , is shredded cabbage and white potatoes cooked with butter .   For many South Africans meat is the centre of any meal . The Khoisan ate roasted meat , and they also dried meat for later use . The influence of their diet is reflected in the common Southern African love of barbecue ( generally called in South Africa by its Afrikaans name , a `` braai '' ) and biltong ( dried preserved meat ) . As in the past , when men kept cattle as their prized possession in the rural areas , South Africans have a preference for beef . Today , South Africans enjoy not only beef , but mutton , goat , chicken and other meats as a centrepiece of a meal . On weekends , many South African families have a `` braai , '' and the meal usually consists of `` pap and vleis '' , which is maize meal and grilled meat . Eating meat even has a ritual significance in both traditional and modern South African culture . In Bantu culture , for weddings , initiations , the arrival of family members after a long trip and other special occasions , families will buy a live animal and slaughter it at home , and then prepare a large meal for the community or neighbourhood . Participants often say that spilling the blood of the animal on the ground pleases the ancestors who invisibly gather around the carcass . On holiday weekends , entrepreneurs will set up pens of live animals along the main roads of townships—mostly sheep and goats—for families to purchase , slaughter , cook and eat . Beef being the most"], [433, "Capri ( ; ) is an island located in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the Sorrentine Peninsula , on the south side of the Gulf of Naples in the Campania region of Italy . The main town Capri that is located on the island shares the name . It has been a resort since the time of the Roman Republic .   Some of the main features of the island include the following : the Marina Piccola ( the little harbour ) , the Belvedere of Tragara ( a high panoramic promenade lined with villas ) , the limestone crags called sea stacks that project above the sea ( the Faraglioni ) , the town of Anacapri , the Blue Grotto ( Grotta Azzurra ) , and the ruins of the Imperial Roman villas .   Capri is part of the region of Campania , Province of Naples . The town of Capri is the island 's main population centre . The island has two harbours , Marina Piccola and Marina Grande ( the main port of the island ) . The separate comune of Anacapri is located high on the hills to the west .   Etymology   The etymology of the name Capri is unclear ; it might either be traced back to the Ancient Greeks ( Ancient Greek κάπρος kapros meaning `` wild boar '' ) , the first recorded colonists to populate the island . But it could also derive from Latin capreae ( goats ) . Fossils of wild boars have been discovered , lending credence to the `` kapros '' etymology ; on the other hand , the Romans called Capri `` goat island '' . Finally , there is also the possibility that the name derives from an Etruscan word for `` rocky '' , though any historical Etruscan rule of the island is disputed .   Capri is a large , limestone and sandstone rock . The sides of the island are perpendicular cliffs and the surface of the island is composed of more cliffs .   Government   Edwin Cerio was mayor of Capri from 1920 to 1923 . Although he was only three years in office , his vision and policies had far-reaching impact on the nature and role of the government on the island .   Italy is a Republic , thus Capri , as part of Italy , has adopted those same principles too . The voters of the island elect representatives for the two villages on the island . The chosen representatives then choose two mayors to govern with them .   History   Ancient and Roman times   The city has been inhabited since early times . Evidence of human settlement was discovered during the Roman era ; according to Suetonius , when the foundations for the villa of Augustus were being excavated , giant bones and 'weapons of stone ' were discovered . The emperor ordered these to be displayed in the garden of his main residence , the Sea Palace . Modern excavations have shown that human presence on the island can be dated to the Neolithic and the Bronze Age . Augustus developed Capri ; he built temples , villas , aqueducts , and planted gardens so he could enjoy his private paradise .   In his Aeneid , Virgil states that the island had been populated by the Greek people of Teleboi , coming from the Ionian Islands . Strabo says that `` in ancient times in Capri there were two towns , later reduced to one . '' Tacitus records that there were twelve Imperial villas in Capri . Ruins of one at Tragara could still be seen in the 19th century .   Augustus ' successor Tiberius built a series of villas at Capri , the most famous of which is the Villa Jovis , one of the best-preserved Roman villas in Italy . In 27 AD , Tiberius permanently moved to Capri , running the Empire from there until his death in 37 AD .   In 182 AD , Emperor Commodus banished his sister Lucilla to Capri . She was executed shortly afterwards .   Middle and Modern Ages   After the end of the Western Roman Empire , Capri returned to the status of a dominion of Naples , and suffered various attacks and ravages by pirates . In 866 Emperor Louis II gave the island to Amalfi . In 987 Pope John XV consecrated the first bishop of Capri , when Capri , Scala , Minori , and Lettere were made dioceses to serve as suffragans of Amalfi , which thereby became a metropolitan see . Capri continued to be a"], [434, "Anna Wintour , OBE ( ; born 3 November 1949 ) is a British journalist and editor . She has been editor-in-chief of Vogue since 1988 . In 2013 , she became artistic director for Condé Nast , Vogue 's publisher . With her trademark pageboy bob haircut and dark sunglasses , Wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world , widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers . Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname `` Nuclear Wintour '' .   She is the eldest daughter of Charles Wintour , who was editor of the London Evening Standard from 1959 to 1976 . Her father consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era . Anna became interested in fashion as a teenager . Her career in fashion journalism began at two British magazines . Later , she moved to the United States , with stints at New York and House & Garden . She returned home for a year to turn around British Vogue , and later assumed control of the franchise 's magazine in New York , reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication . Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry has been the subject of debate within it . Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur , while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty .   A former personal assistant , Lauren Weisberger , wrote the 2003 best selling roman à clef The Devil Wears Prada , later made into a successful film starring Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly , a fashion editor , believed to be based on Wintour . In 2009 , she was the focus of another film , R.J. Cutler 's documentary The September Issue .   Family   Wintour was born in London , in 1949 , to Charles Wintour ( 1917–1999 ) , editor of the Evening Standard , and Eleanor `` Nonie '' Trego Baker ( 1917-1995 ) , daughter of a Harvard law professor . Her parents married in 1940 and divorced in 1979 . Wintour was named after her maternal grandmother , Anna Baker ( born Gilkynson ) , a merchant 's daughter from Pennsylvania . Audrey Slaughter , a magazine editor who founded publications such as Honey and Petticoat , is her stepmother . The late-18th-century novelist Lady Elizabeth Foster , Duchess of Devonshire , was Wintour 's great-great-great-grandmother , and Sir Augustus Vere Foster , the last Baronet of that name , was a granduncle .   She had four siblings . Her older brother , Gerald , died in a traffic accident as a child . One of her younger brothers , Patrick , is also a journalist , currently political editor of The Guardian . James and Nora Wintour have worked in London local government and for international non-governmental organisations respectively .   Early life   In her youth , Wintour was educated at the independent North London Collegiate School , where she frequently rebelled against the dress code by taking up the hemlines of her skirts . At the age of 14 , she began wearing her hair in a bob . She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of Cathy McGowan on Ready Steady Go ! , and from the issues of Seventeen her grandmother sent from America . `` Growing up in London in the '60s , you 'd have to have had Irving Penn 's sack over your head not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion , '' she recalled . Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market .   At the age of 15 , she began dating well-connected older men . She was involved briefly with Piers Paul Read , then 24 . In her later teens , she and gossip columnist Nigel Dempster became a fixture on the London club circuit .   Career   From fashion to journalism   `` I think my father really decided for me that I should work in fashion , '' she recalled in The September Issue . He arranged for his daughter 's first job , at the influential Biba boutique , when she was 15 . The next year , she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods . At her parents ' behest , she also took fashion classes at a nearby school . Soon she gave them up , saying , `` You either know fashion or"], [435, "Springfield is a city in western New England , and the seat of Hampden County , Massachusetts , in the United States . Springfield sits on the eastern bank of the Connecticut River near its confluence with three rivers : the western Westfield River , the eastern Chicopee River , and the eastern Mill River . As of the 2010 Census , the city 's population was 153,060 . Metropolitan Springfield , as one of two metropolitan areas in Massachusetts ( the other being Greater Boston ) , had an estimated population of 698,903 as of 2009 .   The first Springfield in the New World , it is the largest city in Western New England , and the urban , economic , and cultural capital of Massachusetts ' Connecticut River Valley ( colloquially known as the Pioneer Valley ) . It is the third-largest city in Massachusetts and fourth-largest in New England , after Boston , Worcester , and Providence . Springfield has several nicknames – The City of Firsts , because of its many innovations ( see below for a partial list ) ; The City of Homes , due to its Victorian residential architecture ; and Hoop City , as basketball – one of the world 's most popular sports – was invented in Springfield by James Naismith .   Hartford , the capital of Connecticut , lies south of Springfield , on the western bank of the Connecticut River . Bradley International Airport , which sits 12 mi south of Metro Center Springfield , is Hartford-Springfield 's airport . The Hartford-Springfield region is known as the Knowledge Corridor because it hosts over 160,000 university students and over 32 universities and liberal arts colleges – the second-highest concentration of higher-learning institutions in the United States . The city of Springfield itself is home to Springfield College ; Western New England University ; American International College ; and Springfield Technical Community College , among other higher educational institutions .   History   Springfield was founded in 1636 by English Puritan William Pynchon as `` Agawam Plantation '' under the administration of the Connecticut Colony . In 1641 it was renamed after Pynchon 's hometown of Springfield , Essex , England , following incidents that precipitated the settlement joining the Massachusetts Bay Colony . During its early existence , Springfield flourished as both an agricultural settlement and trading post , although its prosperity waned dramatically during ( and after ) King Philip 's War in 1675 , when natives laid siege to it and burned it to the ground .   The original settlement – today 's downtown Springfield – was located atop bluffs at the confluence of four rivers , at the nexus of trade routes to Boston , Albany , New York City , and Montreal , and with some of the northeastern United States ' most fertile soil . In 1777 , Springfield 's location at numerous crossroads led George Washington and Henry Knox to establish the United States ' National Armory at Springfield , which produced the first American musket in 1794 , and later the famous Springfield rifle . From 1777 until its closing during the Vietnam War , the Springfield Armory attracted skilled laborers to Springfield , making it the United States ' longtime center for precision manufacturing . The near-capture of the U.S. Arsenal at Springfield during Shays Rebellion of 1787 led directly to the formation of the U.S . Constitutional Convention .   During the 19th and 20th centuries , Springfielders produced many innovations , including the first American-English dictionary ( 1805 , Merriam Webster ) ; the first use of interchangeable parts and the assembly line in manufacturing , ( 1819 , Thomas Blanchard ; ) the first American horseless car , ( 1825 , Thomas Blanchard ; ) the discovery and patent of vulcanized rubber , ( 1844 , Charles Goodyear ; ) the first American gasoline-powered car , ( 1893 , Duryea Brothers ) ; the first successful motorcycle company , ( 1901 , `` Indian '' ) ; one of America 's first commercial radio stations , ( 1921 , WBZ , broadcast from the Hotel Kimball ) ; and most famously , the world 's second-most-popular sport , basketball , ( 1891 , Dr. James Naismith ) .   Springfield underwent a protracted decline during the second half of the 20th century , due largely to the decommission of the Springfield Armory in 1969 ; poor city planning decisions , such as the location of the elevated I-91 along the city 's Connecticut Riverfront ; and overall decline of industry throughout the northeastern U.S. During the 1980s and 1990s , Springfield developed a national reputation for crime , political"], [436, "The United States Open Tennis Championships is a hardcourt tennis tournament . The tournament is the modern version of one of the oldest tennis championships in the world , the U.S. National Championship , for which men 's singles was first contested in 1881 . Since 1987 , the US Open has been chronologically the fourth and final tennis major comprising the Grand Slam each year ; the other three , in chronological order , are the Australian Open , the French Open and Wimbledon .   The US Open is held annually , starting on the last Monday in August , and lasting for two weeks into September , with the middle weekend coinciding with the Labor Day holiday . The main tournament consists of five event championships : men 's and women 's singles , men 's and women 's doubles , and mixed doubles , with additional tournaments for senior , junior , and wheelchair players . Since 1978 , the tournament has been played on acrylic hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park , Queens , New York City . The US Open is owned and organized by the United States Tennis Association ( USTA ) , a not-for-profit organization . Net proceeds from ticket sales , sponsorships , and television deals are used to promote the development of tennis in the United States .   The US Open is the only Grand Slam that employs tiebreakers in every set of a match . For the other three Grand Slam events , if a match goes to the last set ( the third for women , fifth for men ) and there is a 6–6 tie , the match continues until one player wins by two games ( i.e . 8-6 , 9-7 , 10-8 , etc . ) , while in all four Grand Slam events , the sets played before the last set always employ tiebreakers should a set reach 6-6 .   History   Newport Casino   The tournament was first held in August 1881 on the grass courts at the Newport Casino , Newport , Rhode Island and in that first year only clubs that were members of the United States National Lawn Tennis Association ( USNLTA ) were permitted to enter . The first edition was won by Richard Sears , who went on to win seven consecutive singles titles . From 1884 through 1911 , the tournament used a challenge system whereby the defending champion automatically qualified for the next year 's final in which he would play the winner of the all-comers tournament . In 1915 the national championship was relocated from Newport , Rhode Island to the West Side Tennis Club at Forest Hills , New York ; as early as 1911 an effort was made by a group of tennis players , headed by Karl Behr from New York , to relocate the tournament to New York .   West Side Tennis Club   In early 1915 the issue resurfaced when a group of about 100 tennis players signed a petition in favor of the move , arguing that most tennis clubs , players and fans were located in the New York area and that it would therefore be beneficial for the development of the sport to host the national championship there . This view was opposed by another group of players which included eight former national singles champions . The contentious issue was brought to a vote at the annual USNLTA meeting on February 5 , 1915 and with 128 votes in favor and 119 against it was decided to relocate .   From 1921 through 1923 , the tournament was played at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia . It returned to Forest Hills in 1924 following the completion of the newly constructed 14,000 seat concrete Forest Hills Stadium . Though regarded unofficially by many as a major championship beforehand , the tournament was officially designated as one of the major tournaments by the ILTF commencing in 1924 .   In the first few years of the United States National Championship only men competed and the tournament was known as the US National Singles Championships for Men . Six years after the men 's nationals were first held , the first official U.S. Women 's National Singles Championship was held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in 1887 , won by 17-year-old Philadelphian Ellen Hansell , accompanied by the U.S. Women 's National Doubles Championship ( not held for the next two years ) and U.S. Mixed Doubles Championship ( not held in 1899 ) . The women 's tournament used a challenge system from 1888 through 1918 ,"], [437, "`` Peter Piper '' is an English-language nursery rhyme and well-known tongue-twister .

The film stars Omid Djalili , Richard Schiff , Yigal Naor and Matt Lucas and revolves around a British Muslim who goes through an identity crisis when he discovers he was adopted as a child , having been born to a Jewish family .   Plot   Mahmud Nasir is a husband , father and a British Muslim who listens to rock music , particularly the long deceased pop star Gary Page , and occasionally drinks alcohol . His son , Rashid , wishes to marry Uzma , but they need her devout Muslim cleric stepfather 's , Arshad Al-Masri , blessing . Mahmud agrees to put on the act of devout Muslim for the occasion .   Mahmud , while clearing out his recently deceased mother 's house , stumbles across an adoption certificate . Mahmud learns he was actually adopted by his Muslim parents when he was two weeks old ; his birth parents were Jewish , and his real name is Solomon `` Solly '' Shimshillewitz . This comes as a shock to Mahmud , who is somewhat anti-Semitic , exemplified by his relationship with his American Jewish neighbour , Leonard `` Lenny '' Goldberg .   During an argument with Lenny , Mahmud lets slip his ethnicity and his real name , and Lenny mentions a similarity to the name , Isaac `` Izzy '' Shimshillewitz , a local man , who may be Mahmud 's biological father . Mahmud tracks his father to a Jewish old age home . He tries to visit , but a rabbi refuses him entry , saying it would be a shock for Izzy , a Jewish man , to see his son , a Muslim , and advises him to learn to act more like a Jew if he desires to see his father before he dies .   Lenny agrees to teach Mahmud what he knows about being a Jew , such as dancing like Topol and learning basic Yiddish , but the frequent trips to Lenny 's house arouse Mahmud 's family 's suspicions , especially when Mahmud 's kippah is spotted during a Muslim rally . Mahmud publicly burns the kippah in desperation as a symbol of his supposed hatred of Jews . Mahmud later attends a Bar Mitzvah with Lenny and unintentionally tells a very crude joke to the audience in broken Yiddish , only to be greeted with laughter from the attendees . Mahmud and Lenny attempt to see Izzy , but the rabbi still refuses to let Mahmud inside when he can not say his Jewish Sh'ma or name the Five Books of Moses in Hebrew .   Mahmud and Lenny have a bitter argument and Mahmud storms off , vowing to tell his family the truth immediately , but when he gets home , he sees that Arshad , Uzma and their friends are already there . Arshad , impressed with Mahmud 's supposed devotion to Islam after having seen him burn the kippah on TV , gives his blessing to Rashid and Uzma 's union , but the police arrive , along with the media and a crowd of angry Jews and supportive Muslims , to arrest Mahmud for burning the kippah . In desperation , he yells out in front of everyone that he is Jewish , exonerating him of the crime . A disgusted Arshad leaves with Uzma and his friends .   Mahmud 's family leaves him for his dishonesty , one of his colleagues at work resigns , and he starts drinking . He becomes suicidal , but is rescued by Lenny , who saw his announcement on the news . Mahmud goes to the old age home and demands to see his father , but learns that his father has already died . Mahmud is allowed inside Izzy 's room where he finds a video of his announcement in Izzy 's video machine , which Lenny had sent Izzy .

The Oedipus complex occurs in the third — phallic stage ( ages 3–6 ) — of the five psychosexual development stages : ( i ) the oral , ( ii ) the anal , ( iii ) the phallic , ( iv ) the latent , and ( v ) the genital — in which the source of libidinal pleasure is in a different erogenous zone of the infant 's body . The Oedipal complex originally refers to the sexual desire of a son for his mother and does not have to be reciprocated .   Sigmund Freud , who coined the term `` Oedipus complex '' , believed that the Oedipus complex is a desire for the parent in both males and females ; he deprecated the term `` Electra complex '' , which was introduced by Carl Gustav Jung in regard to the Oedipus complex manifested in young girls . Freud further proposed that boys and girls experience the complex differently : boys in a form of castration anxiety , girls in a form of penis envy ; and that unsuccessful resolution of the complex might lead to neurosis , pedophilia , and homosexuality . A child 's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the complex .   Men and women who are fixated in the Oedipal and Electra stages of their psychosexual development might be considered `` mother-fixated '' and `` father-fixated . '' In adult life , this can lead to a choice of a sexual partner who resembles one 's parent .   Background   Oedipus refers to a 5th-century BC Greek mythological character Oedipus , who unwittingly kills his father , Laius , and marries his mother , Jocasta . A play based on the myth , Oedipus Rex , was written by Sophocles , ca . 429 BC .   Modern productions of Sophocles ' play were staged in Paris and Vienna in the 19th century and were phenomenally successful in the 1880s and 1890s . The Austrian psychiatrist , Sigmund Freud ( 1856–1939 ) , attended . In his book The Interpretation of Dreams first published in 1899 , he proposed that an Oedipal desire is a universal , psychological phenomenon innate ( phylogenetic ) to human beings , and the cause of much unconscious guilt . He based this on his analysis of his feelings attending the play , his anecdotal observations of neurotic or normal children , and on the fact that Oedipus Rex was effective on both ancient and modern audiences . ( He also claimed the play Hamlet “ has its roots in the same soil as Oedipus Rex , ” and that the differences between the two plays are revealing . “ In [ Oedipus Rex ] the child ’ s wishful fantasy that underlies it is brought into the open and realized as it would be in a dream . In Hamlet it remains repressed ; and — just as in the case of a neurosis — we only learn of its existence from its inhibiting consequences . ” )   However , in The Interpretation of Dreams , Freud makes it clear that the “ primordial urges and fears ” that are his concern and the basis of the Oedipal complex are inherent in the myths the play by Sophocles is based on , not primarily in the play itself , which Freud refers to as a “ further modification of the legend ” that originates in a “ misconceived secondary revision of the material , which has sought to exploit it for theological purposes . ”   Freud described the character Oedipus :   A six-stage chronology of Sigmund Freud 's theoretic evolution of the Oedipus complex is :   * Stage 1 . 1897–1909 . After his father 's death in 1896 , and having seen the play Oedipus Rex , by Sophocles , Freud begins using the term `` Oedipus '' . As Freud wrote in a 1897 letter , `` I found in myself a constant love for my mother , and jealousy of my father . I now consider this to be a universal event in early childhood . ''  * Stage 2 . 1909–1914 . Proposes that Oedipal desire is the `` nuclear complex '' of all neuroses ; first usage of ``"], [440, "Seven Pillars of Wisdom is the autobiographical account of the experiences of British soldier T. E. Lawrence ( `` Lawrence of Arabia '' ) , while serving as a liaison officer with rebel forces during the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Turks of 1916 to 1918 .   Title   The title comes from the Book of Proverbs , 9:1 : `` Wisdom hath builded her house , she hath hewn out her seven pillars '' ( King James Version ) . Prior to the First World War , Lawrence had begun work on a scholarly book about seven great cities of the Middle East , to be titled Seven Pillars of Wisdom . When war broke out , it was still incomplete and Lawrence stated that he ultimately destroyed the manuscript although he remained keen on using his original title Seven Pillars of Wisdom for his later work . The book had to be rewritten three times , once following the loss of the manuscript on a train at Reading . From Seven Pillars , `` ... and then lost all but the Introduction and drafts of Books 9 and 10 at Reading Station , while changing trains . This was about Christmas , 1919 . '' ( p. 21 )   Seven Pillars of Wisdom is a biographical account of his experiences during the Arab Revolt of 1916–18 , when Lawrence was based in Wadi Rum ( now a part of Jordan ) as a member of the British Forces of North Africa . With the support of Emir Faisal and his tribesmen , he helped organise and carry out attacks on the Ottoman forces from Aqaba in the south to Damascus in the north . Many sites inside the Wadi Rum area have been named after Lawrence to attract tourists , although there is little or no evidence connecting him to any of these places , including the rock formations near the entrance now known as `` The Seven Pillars '' .   Speculation surrounds the book 's dedication , a poem written by Lawrence and edited by Robert Graves , concerning whether it is to an individual or to the whole Arab race . It begins , `` To S.A. '' , possibly meaning Selim Ahmed , a young Arab boy from Syria of whom Lawrence was very fond . Ahmed died , probably from typhus , aged 19 , a few weeks before the offensive to liberate Damascus . Lawrence received the news of his death some days before he entered Damascus .   I loved you , so I drew these tides of  Men into my hands  And wrote my will across the  Sky and stars  To earn you freedom , the seven  Pillared worthy house ,  That your eyes might be  Shining for me  When I came   Death seemed my servant on the  Road , 'til we were near  And saw you waiting :  When you smiled and in sorrowful  Envy he outran me  And took you apart :  Into his quietness   Love , the way-weary , groped to your body ,  Our brief wage  Ours for the moment  Before Earth 's soft hand explored your shape  And the blind  Worms grew fat upon  Your substance   Men prayed me that I set our work ,  The inviolate house ,  As a memory of you  But for fit monument I shattered it ,  Unfinished : and now  The little things creep out to patch  Themselves hovels  In the marred shadow  Of your gift .   A variant last line of that first stanza—reading , `` When we came '' —appears in some editions ; however , the 1922 Oxford text ( considered the definitive version ; see below ) has `` When I came '' . The poem originated as prose , submitted by letter to Graves , who edited the work heavily into its current form , rewriting an entire stanza and correcting the others .   Manuscripts and editions   Lawrence kept extensive notes throughout the course of his involvement in the Revolt . He began work on a clean narrative in the first half of 1919 while in Paris for the Peace Conference and , later that summer , while back in Egypt . By December 1919 , he had a fair draft of most of the ten books that make up the Seven Pillars of Wisdom but lost it ( except for the introduction and final two books ) when he misplaced his briefcase while changing trains at"], [441, "Timothy Henry `` Tim '' Henman ( born 6 September 1974 ) is a retired English professional tennis player . Henman played a serve-and-volley style of tennis . He was the first male player from the United Kingdom since Roger Taylor in the 1970s to reach the semi-finals of the Wimbledon Men 's Singles Championship . Henman never reached the finals of any Grand Slam but reached six Grand Slam semifinals and won 15 career ATP titles ( 11 in singles and four in doubles ) , including the Paris Masters in 2003 . Also , he scored 40 wins and 14 losses with the Great Britain Davis Cup team .   He was ranked British number 1 in 1996 and again from 1999 to 2005 , from which point he was succeeded by Andy Murray . He reached a career high ranking of World No . 4 during three different periods between July 2002 and October 2004 . He is one of Britain 's most successful open era male tennis players , winning $ 11,635,542 prize money .   Henman started playing tennis before the age of three , and began systematic training in the Slater Squad at eleven . After suffering a serious injury which affected him for the better part of two years , he began touring internationally as a junior and achieved some successes . He rose quickly up the ATP rankings , and by 1996 had reached the quarter-finals of the Wimbledon Championships . Throughout his career , Henman was a noted grass specialist , only becoming truly comfortable on clay and hard court before the end of his career , when in 2004 he reached the semi-finals in both the French and US Open . The year 2005 began a decline for Henman , and from that year onwards he never managed to pass through the third round in a Grand Slam tournament . Henman retired from professional tennis in late 2007 , but he remains active in the ATP Champions Tour ( a tour for former professional tennis players ) .   Early life   Henman was born in Oxford , Oxfordshire , as the youngest boy in a family of three boys . Henman 's father Tony , a solicitor , was accomplished at various sports , including tennis , hockey and squash . His mother Jane , a dress designer , played Junior Wimbledon and introduced Tim and his elder brothers Michael and Richard to tennis as soon as they could walk on the family 's grass tennis court . His great grandfather played at Wimbledon . His maternal grandfather , Henry Billington , played at Wimbledon between 1948 and 1951 , and he represented Britain in the Davis Cup in 1948 , 1950 and 1951 . In 1901 his maternal great-grandmother , Ellen Stanwell-Brown , was reputedly the first woman to serve overarm at Wimbledon . His maternal grandmother , Susan Billington , appeared regularly at Wimbledon in the 1950s , playing mixed doubles on Centre Court with her husband Henry , reaching the third round of the ladies ' doubles in 1951 , 1955 and 1956 .   Henman grew up in Weston-on-the-Green , Oxfordshire , a village between Oxford and Bicester with a population of around 500 . At home , the family owned a grass tennis court in their back garden . Henman began playing tennis before the age of three with a shortened squash racket . At this stage , he was already teaching himself how to serve and volley . At an early stage in his life , Henman decided if he did not succeed in tennis , he would become a golf player instead .   Henman attended the Longbridge School for boys between the ages of five and seven , and was enrolled in the private Dragon School in Oxford from seven to 11 . He excelled in all sports but was always best at tennis . But Henman was small for his age , a factor which would bode against him in the future . In 1985 , he was appointed the school 's captain of tennis and led the school 's tennis team to win 21 out of 27 matches . He remains to this day the only pupil who has won both the school 's junior and senior tennis tournaments in the same year . From the age of eight until his introduction to the Slater Squad , Henman received coaching from the David Lloyd Tennis Centre , where he was given personal lessons by former professional player Onny Parun from New Zealand . In retrospect , Parun stated that Henman 's greatest strength `` had always been his head .

The estimated population in 2007 was 25,505 , increasing to 27,445 at the 2011 Census .   The town is a popular tourist destination owing to its status as birthplace of English playwright and poet William Shakespeare , and receives an estimated 4.9 million visitors a year . The Royal Shakespeare Company resides in Stratford 's Royal Shakespeare Theatre .   History   Stratford has Anglo-Saxon origins , and developed as a market town in the medieval period . The original charters of the town were granted in 1196 , making Stratford over 800 years old . The name is a combination of the Old English strǣt , meaning `` street '' , and ford , indicating a site at which a road forded a river . The `` street '' was a smaller Roman road connecting the larger roads Fosse Way and Icknield Street .   In 1769 the actor David Garrick staged a major Shakespeare Jubilee over three days which saw the construction of a large rotunda and the influx of many visitors . This contributed to the growing phenomenon of Bardolatry which made Stratford a tourist destination .   Stratford was the gateway to the British canal network from the South West before the road and rail networks took over and its industrial past is often overlooked because of the town 's association with Shakespeare .   Governance   The administrative body for the town is the Stratford-upon-Avon Town Council , which is based at the Town Hall in Sheep Street . The Stratford-on-Avon District Council is based at Elizabeth House , Church Street , and the Stratford-upon-Avon Town Trust is based in the Civic Hall , Rother Street . The Town Council is responsible for crime prevention , cemeteries , public conveniences , litter , river moorings , parks , grants via the Town Trust and the selection of the town 's mayor .   Geography   Stratford is close to the Cotswolds , with Chipping Campden 10 mi to the south . The Cotswolds was a major sheep producing area , up until the latter part of the 19th century , with Stratford as one of its main centres for the processing , marketing , and distribution of sheep and wool . Consequently , Stratford also became a centre for tanning during the 15th–17th centuries . Both the river and the Roman road served as trade routes for the town .   Suburbs and areas of Stratford-on-Avon include Shottery , Bishopton , Bridgetown , Tiddington , and Old Town .   Climate   Stratford has a temperate maritime climate , as is usual for the British Isles , meaning extremes of heat and cold are rare . Sunshine hours are low to moderate ( less than 1,400 hours per year ) , and rainfall is spread evenly throughout the year .   The record high temperature is , set in August 1990 , compared to the typical summer maximum of 22 °C . The record low temperature is , recorded in January 1982 . With an average of 62 frosts a year , Stratford is a relatively frosty location . For comparison , nearby Wellesbourne averages 53 frosts a year , and further afield , Malvern , just 33 .   As with much of inland Britain , Stratford experiences much cloud development , while coastal areas remain clear ( see image to the right ) .   Rainfall , at around 620 mm is typical for low-lying areas of central and eastern England . Over 1 mm of rain was recorded on 115.7 days per year , according to the 1971–2000 observation period .   Economy   Apart from tourism , which is a major employer , especially in the hotel , hospitality industry and catering sectors , other industries in the town include boat building and maintenance , bicycles , mechanical and electrical engineering , food manufacture , Information Technology , call centre and service sector activities , a large motor sales sector , industrial plant hire , building suppliers , market gardening , farming , storage and transport logistics , finance and insurance , and a large retail sector .   Major employers in the town include the NFU Mutual Insurance Company ( and Avon Insurance ) , AMEC , Sitel , Tesco , Morrisons , Marks & Spencer , Debenhams , B & Q and Pashley Cycles .

The term `` Impressionism '' is derived from the title of his painting Impression , soleil levant ( Impression , Sunrise ) , which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris .   Monet 's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons . From 1883 Monet lived in Giverny , where he purchased a house and property , and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works . In 1899 he began painting the water lilies , first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature , and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life .   Monet and Impressionism   First `` Impressionist '' exhibition   From the late 1860s , Monet and other like-minded artists met with rejection from the conservative Académie des Beaux-Arts , which held its annual exhibition at the Salon de Paris . During the latter part of 1873 , Monet , Pierre-Auguste Renoir , Camille Pissarro , and Alfred Sisley organized the Société anonyme des artistes peintres , sculpteurs et graveurs ( Anonymous Society of Painters , Sculptors , and Engravers ) to exhibit their artworks independently . At their first exhibition , held in April 1874 , Monet exhibited the work that was to give the group its lasting name .   Impression , Sunrise was painted in 1872 , depicting a Le Havre port landscape . From the painting 's title the art critic Louis Leroy , in his review , `` L'Exposition des Impressionnistes , '' which appeared in Le Charivari , coined the term `` Impressionism '' . It was intended as disparagement but the Impressionists appropriated the term for themselves .   Biography   Birth and childhood   Claude Monet was born on 14 November 1840 on the fifth floor of 45 rue Laffitte , in the 9th arrondissement of Paris . He was the second son of Claude Adolphe Monet and Louise Justine Aubrée Monet , both of them second-generation Parisians . On 20 May 1841 , he was baptized in the local parish church , Notre-Dame-de-Lorette , as Oscar-Claude , but his parents called him simply Oscar . ( He signed his juvenilia `` O. Monet '' . ) Despite being baptized Catholic , Monet later became an atheist .   In 1845 , his family moved to Le Havre in Normandy . His father wanted him to go into the family grocery business , but Monet wanted to become an artist . His mother was a singer .   On 1 April 1851 , Monet entered Le Havre secondary school of the arts . Locals knew him well for his charcoal caricatures , which he would sell for ten to twenty francs . Monet also undertook his first drawing lessons from Jacques-François Ochard , a former student of Jacques-Louis David . On the beaches of Normandy around 1856 he met fellow artist Eugène Boudin , who became his mentor and taught him to use oil paints . Boudin taught Monet `` en plein air '' ( outdoor ) techniques for painting . [ http : //www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_bio_165.html Biography for Claude Monet ] Guggenheim Collection .

At the age of sixteen , he left school and went to live with his widowed , childless aunt , Marie-Jeanne Lecadre .   Paris and Algeria   When Monet traveled to Paris to visit the Louvre , he witnessed painters copying from the old masters . Having brought his paints and other tools with him , he would instead go and sit by a window and paint what he saw . Monet was in Paris for several years and met other young painters , including Édouard Manet and others who would become friends and fellow Impressionists .   After drawing a low ballot number in March 1861 , Monet was drafted into the First Regiment of African Light Cavalry ( Chasseurs d'Afrique )"], [445, "The Argentine Navy or Navy of the Argentine Republic or Armada of the Argentine Republic ( — ARA , also Armada Argentina ) is the navy of Argentina . It is one of the three branches of the Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic , together with the Army and the Air Force . Each ship of the Argentine Navy is designated with the prefix `` ARA '' before its name .   The Argentine Navy day is celebrated on May 17 , anniversary of the victory achieved in 1814 in the Battle of Montevideo over the Spanish fleet during the war of Independence .   History   19th century   The Argentine Navy was created in the aftermath of the May Revolution of May 25 , 1810 , which started the war for independence from Spain . The navy was first created to support Manuel Belgrano in the Paraguay campaign , but it was sunk by ships from Montevideo , and did not take part in that conflict . Renewed conflicts with Montevideo led to the creation of a second fleet , which participated in the capture of the city . As Buenos Aires had little maritime history , most men in the navy were from other nations , such as the Irish-born admiral William Brown , who directed the operation . As the cost of maintaining a navy was too high , most of the Argentine naval forces were composed of privateers .   Brown led the Argentine navy in further naval conflicts at the War with Brazil and the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata .   In the 1870s the Argentine Navy began modernizing itself . At the close of the century , the force included :   * 5 armoured cruisers  * 4 coastal defence ironclads  * 3 second-class , high-speed , British-built cruisers  * 7 modern small cruisers and gunboats  * 4 destroyers and  * 22 torpedo boats .   The most powerful ships at this time included the Italian-built and her sister ships : , , and , each at over 6,000 tons . Three older ironclads , , , and dated from the 1880s and early 1890s .   The navy 's ships were built primarily in Italy , Britain , France , and Spain and were operated by over 600 officers and 7760 seamen . These were supported by a battalion of marines and an artillery battery .   20th century   Argentina remained neutral in both world wars . In 1940 , Argentina 's navy was ranked the eighth most powerful in the world ( after the European powers , Japan , and the United States ) and the largest in Latin America . A ten-year building programme costing $ 60 million had produced a force of 14,500 sailors and over a thousand officers . The fleet included two First World War-era ( but modernized ) American-built s , three modern cruisers , a dozen British-built destroyers , and three submarines in addition to minelayers , minesweepers , coastal defence ships , and gunboats . A naval air force was also in operation .   In the postwar period , Naval Aviation and Marine Corps units were put under direct Navy command . With Brazil , Argentina is one of two South American countries to have operated two aircraft carriers : the and .   The Argentine Navy has been traditionally heavily involved in fishery inspection helping the Coast Guard : most notably in 1966 a destroyer fired on and holed a Soviet trawler that had refused to be escorted to Mar del Plata , in the 1970s there were four more incidents with Soviet and Bulgarian ships and continued in recent years .   The Navy also took part in all military coups through the 20th century . During the last dictatorship , Navy personnel were involved in the Dirty War of the late 1970s in which thousands of people were kidnapped , tortured and killed by the forces of the Military Junta . The Naval Mechanics School , known as ESMA , was a notorious centre for torture . Among their more well-known victims were the Swedish teenager Dagmar Hagelin and French nuns , Alice Domon and Léonie Duquet ( In October 2007 the Argentine Navy formally handed possession of the school to human rights groups to turn into a memorial museum ) . During this regime , the Navy was also the main supporter of a military solution for the country 's two longest standing disputes : the Beagle Conflict with Chile and the Falkland Islands ( ) with the United Kingdom .

When"], [448, "Aidan of Lindisfarne ( died 31 August 651 ) was an Irish monk and missionary credited with restoring Christianity to Northumbria . He founded a monastic cathedral on the island of Lindisfarne , served as its first bishop , and travelled ceaselessly throughout the countryside , spreading the gospel to both the Anglo-Saxon nobility and to the socially disenfranchised ( including children and slaves ) .   He is known as the Apostle of Northumbria and is recognised as a saint by the Orthodox Church , the Roman Catholic Church , the Anglican Communion and others .   Biography   Bede 's meticulous and detailed account of Aidan 's life provides the basis for most biographical sketches ( both classical and modern ) . One notable lacuna , which ( somewhat paradoxically ) reinforces the notion of Bede 's reliability , is that virtually nothing is known of the monk 's early life , save that he was a monk at the ancient monastery on the island of Iona from a relatively young age and that he was of Irish descent . Aidan was known for his strict asceticism .

In the monastery of Iona ( founded by Columba of the Irish Church ) , the religion soon found one of its principal exponents in Oswald of Northumbria , a noble youth who had been raised there as a king in exile since 616 . Baptized as a Christian , the young king vowed to bring Christianity back to his people—an opportunity that presented itself in 634 , when he gained the crown of Northumbria .   Owing to his historical connection to Iona 's monastic community , King Oswald requested that missionaries be sent from that monastery instead of the Roman-sponsored monasteries of Southern England . At first , they sent him a bishop named Cormán , but he alienated many people by his harshness , and returned in failure to Iona reporting that the Northumbrians were too stubborn to be converted . Aidan criticised Cormán 's methods and was soon sent as his replacement in 635.Powicke Handbook of British Chronology p. 237   Missionary efforts   Allying himself with the pious king , Aidan chose the island of Lindisfarne , which was close to the royal castle at Bamburgh , as the seat of his diocese . An inspired missionary , Aidan would walk from one village to another , politely conversing with the people he saw and slowly interesting them in Christianity : in this , he followed the early apostolic model of conversion , by offering `` them first the milk of gentle doctrine , to bring them by degrees , while nourishing them with the Divine Word , to the true understanding and practice of the more advanced precepts . '' By patiently talking to the people on their own level ( and by taking an active interest in their lives and communities ) , Aidan and his monks slowly restored Christianity to the Northumbrian countryside . King Oswald , who after his years of exile had a perfect command of Irish , often had to translate for Aidan and his monks , who did not speak English at first .   In his years of evangelism , Aidan was responsible for the construction of churches , monasteries and schools throughout Northumbria . At the same time , he earned a tremendous reputation for his pious charity and dedication to the less fortunate—such as his tendency to provide room , board and education to orphans , and his use of contributions to pay for the freedom of slaves :   He was one to traverse both town and country on foot , never on horseback , unless compelled by some urgent necessity ; and wherever in his way he saw any , either rich or poor , he invited them , if infidels , to embrace the mystery of the faith or if they were believers , to strengthen them in the faith , and to stir them up by words and actions to alms and good works . … This [ the reading of scriptures and psalms , and meditation upon holy truths ] was the daily employment of himself and all that were with him , wheresoever they went ; and if it happened , which was but seldom , that he was invited to eat with the king"], [449, "Ronald Wilson Reagan ( ; February 6 , 1911 – June 5 , 2004 ) was an American politician and actor who served as the 40th President of the United States from 1981 to 1989 . Prior to his presidency , he was the 33rd Governor of California from 1967 to 1975 , following a career as a Hollywood actor and union leader .   Raised in a poor family in small towns of northern Illinois , Ronald Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and worked as a sports announcer on several regional radio stations . After moving to Hollywood in 1937 , he became an actor and starred in a few major productions . Reagan was twice elected as President of the Screen Actors Guild , the labor union for actors , where he worked to root out Communist influence . In the 1950s , he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at General Electric factories . Having been a lifelong Democrat , his views changed . He became a conservative and in 1962 switched to the Republican Party . In 1964 , Reagan 's speech , `` A Time for Choosing '' , in support of Barry Goldwater 's floundering presidential campaign , earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman . Building a network of supporters , he was elected Governor of California in 1966 . As governor , Reagan raised taxes , turned a state budget deficit to a surplus , challenged the protesters at the University of California , ordered National Guard troops in during a period of protest movements in 1969 , and was re-elected in 1970 . He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nominations in 1968 and 1976 ; four years later , he easily won the nomination outright , going on to be elected the oldest President , defeating incumbent Jimmy Carter in 1980 .   Entering the presidency in 1981 , Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives . His supply-side economic policies , dubbed `` Reaganomics '' , advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth , control of the money supply to curb inflation , economic deregulation , and reduction in government spending . In his first term he survived an assassination attempt , escalated the War on Drugs , and fought public-sector labor . Over his two terms , his economic policies saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5 % to 4.4 % , and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3.4 % ; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending , increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall , even after adjustment for inflation . During his reelection bid , Reagan campaigned on the notion that it was `` Morning in America '' , winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in history . Foreign affairs dominated his second term , including ending of the Cold War , the bombing of Libya , and the Iran–Contra affair . Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an `` evil empire '' , he transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback , by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev , which culminated in the INF Treaty , shrinking both countries ' nuclear arsenals . During his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate , President Reagan challenged Gorbachev to `` tear down this wall ! `` . Five months after the end of his term , the Berlin Wall fell , and on December 26 , 1991 , nearly three years after he left office , the Soviet Union collapsed .   Leaving office in 1989 , Reagan held an approval rating of sixty-eight percent , matching those of Franklin D. Roosevelt , and later Bill Clinton , as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era . While having planned an active post-presidency , in 1994 Reagan disclosed his diagnosis with Alzheimer 's disease earlier that year , appearing publicly for the last time at the funeral of Richard Nixon ; he died ten years later in 2004 at the age of 93 . An icon among Republicans , he ranks favorably in public and critical opinion of U.S. Presidents , and his tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States .   Early life   Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in an apartment on the second floor of a commercial building in Tampico , Illinois on February 6 , 1911 , the son of Nelle Clyde ( Wilson ) and John Edward `` Jack '' Reagan . Reagan 's father was a salesman and a storyteller , the grandson of Irish"], [450, "Communist propaganda in the Soviet Union was extensively based on the Marxism-Leninism ideology to promote the Communist Party line . In societies with pervasive censorship , the propaganda was omnipresent and very efficient . It penetrated even social and natural sciences giving rise to various pseudo-scientific theories like Lysenkoism , whereas fields of real knowledge , as genetics , cybernetics , and comparative linguistics were condemned and forbidden as `` bourgeois pseudoscience '' . With `` truths repressed , falsehoods in every field were incessantly rubbed in print , at endless meetings , in school , in mass demonstrations , on the radio '' .   The main Soviet censorship body , Glavlit , was employed not only to eliminate any undesirable printed materials , but also `` to ensure that the correct ideological spin was put on every published item '' . Telling anything against the `` Party line '' was punished by imprisonment or through punitive psychiatry . `` Today a man only talks freely to his wife – at night , with the blankets pulled over his head '' , said writer Isaac Babel privately to a trusted friend .   Theory of Propaganda   According to historian Peter Kenez , `` the Russian socialists have contributed nothing to the theoretical discussion of the techniques of mass persuasion . ... The Bolsheviks never looked for and did not find devilishly clever methods to influence people 's minds , to brainwash them . '' This lack of interest , says Kenez , `` followed from their notion of propaganda . They thought of propaganda as part of education . ''   Media   Schools and youth organizations   An important goal of Communist propaganda was to create a new man . Schools and the Communist youth organizations , like Soviet pioneers and Komsomol , served to remove children from the `` petit-bourgeois '' family and indoctrinate the next generation into the collective way of life . The idea that the upbringing of children was the concern of their parents was explicitly rejected .   One schooling theorist stated :  We must make the young into a generation of Communists . Children , like soft wax , are very malleable and they should be moulded into good Communists ... We must rescue children from the harmful influence of the family ... We must nationalize them . From the earliest days of their little lives , they must find themselves under the beneficent influence of Communist schools ... To oblige the mother to give her child to the Soviet state – that is our task . `` .   Those born after the Revolution were explicitly told that they were to build a utopia of brotherhood and justice , and to not be like their parents , but completely Red .  `` Lenin 's corners '' , `` political shrines for the display of propaganda about the god-like founder of the Soviet state '' have been established in all schools . Schools conducted marches , songs and pledges of allegiance to Soviet leadership . One of purposes was to instill in children the idea that they are involved in the World revolution , which is more important than any family ties . Pavlik Morozov , who betrayed his father to the secret police NKVD , was promoted as a great positive example .   Teachers in economic and social sciences were particularly responsible for inculcating `` unshakable '' Marxist-Leninist views .   All teachers were prone to follow , strictly , the plan for educating children approved by top for reasons of safety , which could cause serious problems dealing with social events that , having just happened , were not included in the plan . Children of `` socially alien '' elements were often the target of abuse or expelled , in the name of class struggle . Early in the regime , many teachers were drawn into Communist plans for schooling because of a passion for literacy and numeracy , which the Communists were attempting to spread .   Young Pioneers , the youth group , was an important factor in the indoctrination of children . They were taught to be truthful and uncompromising and to fight the enemies of socialism . By the 1930s , this indoctrination completely dominated the Young Pioneers .   Radio   Radio was put to good use , especially to reach the illiterate ; radio receivers were put in communal locations , where the peasants would have to come to hear news , such as changes to rationing , and received propaganda broadcasts with it ; some of these locations were also used for posters .

The city lies on the Sunzha River . According to the 2010 Census , it had a population of 271,573 ; up from 210,720 recorded in the 2002 Census , but still only about two-thirds of 399,688 recorded in the 1989 Census .   Names   In Russian , `` Grozny '' means `` fearsome '' , `` awesome '' , or `` redoubtable '' , the same word as in Ivan Grozny or Ivan the Terrible . While the official name in Chechen is the same , informally the city is known as `` '' , which literally means `` the city ( ) on the Sunzha River ( ) '' .   In 1996 , during the First Chechen War , the Chechen separatists renamed the city Dzokhar-Ghala ( ) , or Dzhokhar/Djohar for short , after Dzhokhar Dudayev , the first President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria . In December 2005 , the Chechen parliament voted to rename the city `` Akhmadkala '' ( after Akhmad Kadyrov ) —a proposition which was rejected by his son Ramzan Kadyrov , the prime minister and later President of the republic .   History   Russian fort   The fortress of Groznaya ( ; lit . fearsome ) was founded in 1818 as a Russian military outpost on the Sunzha River by general Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov . As the fort was being built the workers were fired upon by the Chechens . The Russians solved the problem by placing a cannon at a carefully chosen point outside the walls . When night fell and the Chechens came out of their hiding places to drag the gun away all the other guns opened up with grapeshot . When the Chechens recovered their senses and began to carry away the bodies the guns fired again . When it was over 200 dead were counted . Thus did the 'terrible ' fort receive its baptism of fire . It was a prominent defense center during the Caucasian War . After the annexation of the region by the Russian Empire , the military use of the old fortress was obsolete and in December 1869 it was renamed Grozny and granted town status .

А. , `` Записки краеведа '' , Чечено-Ингушское книжное издательство , Грозный,1984 ] As most of the residents there were Terek Cossacks , the town grew slowly until the development of oil reserves in the early 20th century . This encouraged the rapid development of industry and petrochemical production . In addition to the oil drilled in the city itself , the city became a geographical center of Russia 's network of oil fields , and in 1893 became part of the Transcaucasia — Russia Proper railway . The result was the population almost doubled from 15,600 in 1897 to 30,400 in 1913 .   Soviet regional capital   One day after the October Revolution , on November 8 , 1917 , the Bolsheviks headed by N. Anisimov seized Grozny . As the Russian Civil War escalated , the Proletariat formed the 12th Red Army , and the garrison held out against numerous attacks by Terek Cossacks from August 11 to November 12 , 1918 . However , with the arrival of Denikin 's armies , the Bolsheviks were forced to withdraw and Grozny was captured on February 4 , 1919 by the White Army . Underground operations were carried out , but only the arrival of the Caucasus front of the Red Army in 1920 allowed the city to permanently end up with the Russian SFSR on March 17 . Simultaneously it became part of the Soviet Mountain Republic , which was formed on January 20 , 1921 , and was the capital of the Chechen National Okrug inside it .   On November 30 , 1922 , the mountain republic was dissolved , and the national okrug became the Chechen Autonomous Oblast ( Chechen AO ) with Grozny as the administrative center . At this time most of the population was still Russian , but of Cossack descent . As Cossacks were viewed as a potential threat to the Soviet nation , Moscow actively encouraged the migration of Chechens into the city from the mountains . In 1934 the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Oblast was formed , becoming the Chechen-Ingush ASSR in 1936 .

Churchill was also an officer in the British Army , a non-academic historian , a writer ( as Winston S. Churchill ) , and an artist . He won the Nobel Prize in Literature , and was the first person to be made an honorary citizen of the United States .   Churchill was born into the family of the Dukes of Marlborough , a branch of the Spencer family . His father , Lord Randolph Churchill , was a charismatic politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer ; his mother , Jennie Jerome , was an American socialite . As a young army officer , he saw action in British India , the Anglo–Sudan War , and the Second Boer War . He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote books about his campaigns .   At the forefront of politics for fifty years , he held many political and cabinet positions . Before the First World War , he served as President of the Board of Trade , Home Secretary , and First Lord of the Admiralty as part of Asquith 's Liberal government . During the war , he continued as First Lord of the Admiralty until the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign caused his departure from government . He then briefly resumed active army service on the Western Front as commander of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers . He returned to government under Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions , Secretary of State for War , Secretary of State for Air , then Secretary of State for the Colonies . After two years out of Parliament , he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Baldwin 's Conservative government of 1924–1929 , controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity , a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy .   Out of office and politically `` in the wilderness '' during the 1930s because of his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII , Churchill took the lead in warning about Nazi Germany and in campaigning for rearmament . At the outbreak of the Second World War , he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty . Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940 , Churchill became Prime Minister . His speeches and radio broadcasts helped inspire British resistance , especially during the difficult days of 1940–41 when the British Commonwealth and Empire stood almost alone in its active opposition to Adolf Hitler . He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured .   After the Conservative Party lost the 1945 election , he became Leader of the Opposition to the Labour Government . He publicly warned of an `` Iron Curtain '' of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity . After winning the 1951 election , Churchill again became Prime Minister . His second term was preoccupied by foreign affairs , including the Malayan Emergency , Mau Mau Uprising , Korean War , and a UK-backed coup d'état in Iran . Domestically his government laid great emphasis on house-building . Churchill suffered a serious stroke in 1953 and retired as Prime Minister in 1955 , although he remained a Member of Parliament until 1964 . Upon his death aged ninety in 1965 , Elizabeth II granted him the honour of a state funeral , which saw one of the largest assemblies of world statesmen in history . Named the Greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll , Churchill is widely regarded as being among the most influential people in British history , consistently ranking well in opinion polls of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom .

Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7:00 pm , including electronic dance , hip hop , rock , indie or interviews . It is aimed primarily at the 15–29 age group , although the average age of the UK audience in 2008 was 33 . BBC Radio 1 started 24-hour broadcasting on 1 May 1991 .   History   First broadcast   Radio 1 was established in 1967 ( along with the more middle of the road BBC Radio 2 ) as a successor to the BBC Light Programme , which had broadcast popular music and other entertainment since 1945 . Radio 1 was conceived as a direct response to the popularity of offshore pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline and Radio London , which had been outlawed by Act of Parliament . Radio 1 was launched at 7:00 am on Saturday 30 September 1967 .   The first disc jockey to broadcast on the new station was Tony Blackburn , whose cheery style , first heard on Radio Caroline and Radio London , won him the prime slot on what became known as the `` Radio 1 Breakfast Show '' . The first words on Radio 1 – after a countdown by the Controller of Radios 1 and 2 , Robin Scott , and a jingle , recorded at PAMS in Dallas , Texas , beginning `` The voice of Radio 1 '' – were `` ... And , good morning everyone . Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio 1 '' . This was the first use of US-style jingles on BBC radio , but the style was familiar to listeners who were acquainted with Blackburn and other DJs from their days on pirate radio . The first complete record played on Radio 1 was `` Flowers in the Rain '' by The Move . The second single was `` Massachusetts '' by The Bee Gees . The breakfast show remains the most prized slot in the Radio 1 schedule , with every change of breakfast show presenter exciting considerable media interest .  The initial rota of staff included John Peel and a gaggle of others , some hired from pirates , such as Keith Skues , Ed Stewart , Mike Raven , David Ryder , Jim Fisher , Jimmy Young , Dave Cash , Kenny Everett , Simon Dee , Terry Wogan , Duncan Johnson , Doug Crawford , Tommy Vance , Chris Denning , Emperor Rosko , Pete Murray , and Bob Holness . Many of the most popular pirate radio voices , such as Simon Dee , had only a one-hour slot per week , ( `` Midday Spin .

The very fact that it was part of an `` establishment '' institution such as the BBC was a turn-off for some , and needle time restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had . It also had limited finances ( partially because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station ) and often , as in January 1975 , suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks , strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives .   Despite this , it gained massive audiences , becoming the most listened to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows ( up to 20 million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows ) . In the early-mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids , thanks to the Publicity Department 's high profile work .

The television series Star Trek : The Original Series , Star Trek : The Animated Series , See the Canon issues section of the The Animated Series page for more details . Star Trek : The Next Generation , Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Star Trek : Voyager , Star Trek : Enterprise , Star Trek : Discovery as well as the Star Trek film franchise make up the franchise 's canon .   The first series , now referred to as The Original Series , debuted in 1966 and ran for three seasons on NBC . It followed the galactic adventures of James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship Enterprise , an exploration vessel of a 23rd-century interstellar `` United Federation of Planets '' . In creating the first Star Trek , Roddenberry was inspired by Westerns such as Wagon Train , the Horatio Hornblower novels and Gulliver 's Travels . In fact , the original series was originally described as Wagon Train to the Stars . These adventures continued in the short-lived Star Trek : The Animated Series and six feature films . Four spin-off television series were eventually produced : Star Trek : The Next Generation followed the crew of a new starship Enterprise set a century after the original series ; Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Star Trek : Voyager , set contemporaneously with The Next Generation ; and Star Trek : Enterprise , set before the original series , in the early days of human interstellar travel . Four additional The Next Generation feature films were produced . In 2009 , the film franchise underwent a `` reboot '' set in an alternate timeline , the `` Kelvin Timeline '' , titled simply Star Trek . This film featured a new cast portraying younger versions of the crew from the original show . A sequel to that film , Star Trek Into Darkness , premiered on May 16 , 2013 . A thirteenth film feature and sequel , Star Trek Beyond , was released in July 2016 , to coincide with the franchise 's 50th anniversary . A new Star Trek TV series , titled Star Trek : Discovery , will premiere in January 2017 on the digital platform CBS All Access .   Star Trek has been a cult phenomenon for decades . Fans of the franchise are called Trekkies or Trekkers . The franchise spans a wide range of spin-offs including games , figurines , novels , toys , and comics . Star Trek had a themed attraction in Las Vegas that opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008 . At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world . The series has its own full-fledged constructed language , Klingon . Several parodies have been made of Star Trek . In addition , viewers have produced several fan productions .   Star Trek is noted for its influence on the world outside of science fiction . It has been cited as an inspiration for several technological inventions , including the cell phone and tablet computers . The franchise is also noted for its progressive civil rights stances . The Original Series included one of television 's first multiracial casts . Star Trek references can be found throughout popular culture from movies such as the submarine thriller Crimson Tide to the animated series South Park .   Conception and setting   As early as 1964 , Gene Roddenberry drafted a proposal for the science-fiction series that would become Star Trek . Although he publicly marketed it as a Western in outer space—a so-called `` Wagon Train to the Stars '' ( like the popular Western TV series ) —he privately told friends that he was modeling it on Jonathan Swift 's Gulliver 's Travels , intending each episode to act on two levels : as a suspenseful adventure story and as a morality tale .

He played in 11 first-class matches between 1957 and 1973 , accumulating 226 runs and 12 wickets . He was overshadowed by his brothers Shafqat Rana and Azmat Rana who both represented Pakistan at Test level .   Umpiring career   Rana made his international debut as an umpire in 1974 at Lahore , the city that had become his hometown . The match was between Pakistan and the West Indies . His career continued until his last match between Pakistan and New Zealand in 1996 , also at Lahore . He stood in 18 test matches and 22 One Day Internationals .   Gatting controversy   In a test match in Faisalabad in 1987 , Rana argued furiously with Mike Gatting . The argument stopped the match , and footage of the English cricket captain and the umpire shouting at each other with fingers waved in the other 's face was widely broadcast .   The incident occurred on the second day of the test after Gatting was considered by Rana to have made an alteration to the fielding positions as Eddie Hemmings ran in to bowl - Rana stopped the game and accused Gatting of cheating . Rana had already upset the English by wearing a Pakistan sweater and placing Mudassar Nazar 's cap on his own head . The game was stopped by the incident and only resumed the following day . Rana and Gatting were both accused of using foul language , much of which was heard by a worldwide TV audience via the stump microphone .

The home side had previously supplied the umpires but the International Cricket Council have since brought in neutral officials ."], [457, "An introduced , alien , exotic , non-indigenous , or non-native species , or simply an introduction , is a species living outside its native distributional range , which has arrived there by human activity , either deliberate or accidental . Non-native species can have various effects on the local ecosystem . Introduced species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction are called invasive species . Some have a negative effect on a local ecosystem . Some introduced species may have no negative effect or only minor impact . Some species have been introduced intentionally to combat pests . They are called biocontrols and may be regarded as beneficial as an alternative to pesticides in agriculture for example . In some instances the potential for being beneficial or detrimental in the long run remains unknown . A list of some introduced species is given in a separate article .   The effects of introduced species on natural environments have gained much scrutiny from scientists , governments , farmers and others .   Terminology   The terminology associated with introduced species is now in flux for various reasons . Other terms with somewhat similar meanings ) with introduced are acclimatized , adventive , naturalized , and immigrant but those terms refer to a subset of introduced species : those that have become established and can reproduce without human assistance . The term invasive refers only to those species that become established and spread beyond the place of introduction . For practical purposes , this term is applied only to invasive species that cause damage .   In the broadest and most widely used sense , an introduced species is synonymous with non-native and therefore applies as well to most garden and farm organisms ; these adequately fit the basic definition given above . However , some sources add to that basic definition `` and are now reproducing in the wild , '' Carlton , James T. 2002 . Introduced Species in U.S. Coastal Waters . Pew Oceans Commission . which removes from consideration as introduced all of those species raised or grown in gardens or farms that do not survive without tending by people . With respect to plants , these latter are in this case defined as either ornamental or cultivated plants .   The following definition from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , although perhaps lacking ecological sophistication , is more typical : introduced species `` A species that has been intentionally or inadvertently brought into a region or area . Also called an exotic or non-native species . '' Introduction of a species outside its native range is all that is required to be qualified as an `` introduced species '' such that one can distinguish between introduced species that may not occur except in cultivation , under domestication or captivity whereas others become established outside their native range and reproduce without human assistance . Such species might be termed `` naturalized '' , `` established '' , `` wild non-native species '' . If they further spread beyond the place of introduction they are called `` invasive '' . The transition from introduction , to establishment and to invasion has been described in the context of plants . Introduced species are essentially `` non-native '' species . Invasive species are those introduced species that spreadwidely or quickly and cause harm , be that to the environment , human health , other valued resources or the economy . There have been calls from scientists to consider a species `` invasive '' only in terms of their spread and reproduction rather than the harm they may cause .   According to a practical definition , an invasive species is one that has been introduced and become a pest in its new location , spreading ( invading ) by natural means . The term is used to imply both a sense of urgency and actual or potential harm . For example , U.S. Executive Order 13112 ( 1999 ) defines `` invasive species '' as `` an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health '' . The biological definition of invasive species , on the other hand , makes no reference to the harm they may cause , only to the fact that they spread beyond the area of original introduction .   Although some argue that `` invasive '' is a loaded word and harm is difficult to define , the fact of the matter is that organisms have and continue to be introduced to areas in which they are not native , sometimes with but usually without much regard to the harm"], [458, "Association football , more commonly known as football or soccer , is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball . It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies , making it the world 's most popular sport . The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end . The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal .   The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and only in their penalty area . Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball , but may also use their head or torso . The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins . If the score is level at the end of the game , either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition . The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863 . Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football ( FIFA ; ) , which organises World Cups for both men and women every four years .   Name   The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name association football was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time , specifically rugby football . The term soccer originated in England , first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford `` -er '' abbreviation of the word `` association '' .   Within the English-speaking world , association football is now usually called football in the United Kingdom and mainly soccer in Canada and the United States . People in Australia , Ireland and New Zealand use either or both terms , although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use `` football '' for the formal name .   History   According to FIFA , the Chinese competitive game cuju ( 蹴鞠 , literally `` kick ball '' ) is the earliest form of football for which there is scientific evidence . Cuju players could use any of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net . It was remarkably similar to modern football , though similarities to rugby occurred . During the Han Dynasty ( 206 BC–220 AD ) , cuju games were standardized and rules were established .   Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games . An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a vase at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens appears on the UEFA European Championship Cup . [ http : //www.bangkokpost.com/print/413747/ Bangkok Post article ] Athenaeus , writing in 228 AD , referenced the Roman ball game harpastum . Phaininda , episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence . They all appear to have resembled rugby football , wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football . As with pre-codified `` mob football '' , the antecedent of all modern football codes , these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking . Non-competitive games included kemari in Japan , chuk-guk in Korea and woggabaliri in Australia .   Association football in itself does not have a classical history . Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA have recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe . The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England . The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD .   The Cambridge Rules , first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848 , were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes , including association football . The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College , Cambridge , at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton , Harrow , Rugby , Winchester and Shrewsbury schools . They were not universally adopted . During the 1850s , many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world , to play various forms of football . Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules , most notably the Sheffield Football Club , formed by former public school pupils in 1857 , which led to formation of"], [459, "Figure 1 . A whole note and a whole rest .   In music , a whole note ( American ) or semibreve ( British ) is a note represented by a hollow oval note head , like a half note ( or minim ) , and no note stem ( see Figure 1 ) . Its length is equal to four beats in 4/4 time , that is the whole 4/4 measure ( or bar ) . Most other notes are fractions of the whole note ; half notes are played for one half the duration of the whole note , quarter notes ( or crotchets ) are each played for one quarter the duration , etc .   A whole note lasts half as long as a double whole note ( or breve—hence the British name , semibreve ) , and twice as long as a half note , or minim . The symbol is first found in music notation from the late thirteenth century .   A related symbol is the whole rest ( or semibreve rest ) , which usually denotes a silence for the same duration . Whole rests are drawn as filled-in rectangles generally hanging under the second line from the top of a musical staff , though they may occasionally be put under a different line in more complicated passages , such as when two instruments or vocalists are written on one staff , and one is temporarily silent .   Other lengths   The whole note and whole rest may also be used in music of free rhythm , such as Anglican chant , to denote a whole measure , irrespective of the time of that measure . The whole rest can be used this way in almost all or all forms of music .   Etymology   The whole note derives from the semibrevis of mensural notation , and this is the origin of the British name . The American name is a calque of the German ganze Note .   The names of this note ( and rest ) in different languages vary greatly :   The Catalan , French and Spanish names for the note ( meaning `` round '' ) derive from the fact that the semibrevis was distinguished by its round stemless shape , which is true as well of the modern form ( in contrast to the double whole note or shorter values with stems ) . The Greek name means `` whole '' . Chinese , Japanese , Korean , and Vietnamese names mean `` whole note '' ."], [460, "Yes Minister is a satirical British sitcom written by Sir Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn that was first transmitted by BBC Television between 1980 and 1984 , split over three seven-episode series . The sequel , Yes , Prime Minister , ran from 1986 to 1988 . In total there were 39 episodes , of which all but two lasted half an hour . Several episodes were adapted for BBC Radio , and a stage play was produced in 2010 , the latter leading to a new television series on UKTV Gold in 2013 .   Set principally in the private office of a British Cabinet minister in the fictional Department of Administrative Affairs in Whitehall , Yes Minister follows the ministerial career of the Rt Hon Jim Hacker MP , played by Paul Eddington . His various struggles to formulate and enact legislation or effect departmental changes are opposed by the British Civil Service , in particular his Permanent Secretary , Sir Humphrey Appleby , played by Sir Nigel Hawthorne . His Principal Private Secretary Bernard Woolley , played by Derek Fowlds , is usually caught between the two . The sequel , Yes , Prime Minister , continued with the same cast and followed the events of the premiership of Jim Hacker after his unexpected elevation to Number 10 upon the resignation of the previous Prime Minister .   The series received a number of awards , including several BAFTAs and in 2004 was voted sixth in the Britain 's Best Sitcom poll . It was the favourite television programme of the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , Margaret Thatcher .   Situation   The series opens in the wake of a general election in which the incumbent government has been defeated by the opposition party , to which Jim Hacker MP belongs . His party affiliation is never stated , and his party emblem is clearly neither Conservative nor Labour . The Prime Minister offers Hacker the position of Minister of Administrative Affairs , which he accepts . Hacker goes to his department and meets his Permanent Secretary , Sir Humphrey Appleby , and his Principal Private Secretary , Bernard Woolley . While Appleby is outwardly deferential towards the new minister , he is prepared to defend the status quo at all costs . Woolley is sympathetic towards Hacker but as Appleby reminds him , his civil servant superiors will have much to say about the course of his future career , while ministers do not usually stay long in one department . Many of the episodes revolve around proposals backed by Hacker but frustrated by Appleby , and others revolve around proposals promoted by the latter but rejected by Hacker , which Appleby attempts by all means necessary to persuade Hacker to accept . They do occasionally join forces in order to achieve a common goal , such as preventing the closure of their department or dealing with a diplomatic incident .   As the series revolves around the inner workings of central government , most of the scenes take place in private locations , such as offices and exclusive members ' clubs . Lynn says that `` there was not a single scene set in the House of Commons because government does not take place in the House of Commons . Some politics and much theatre takes place there . Government happens in private . As in all public performances , the real work is done in rehearsal , behind closed doors . Then the public and the House are shown what the government wishes them to see . '' However , the episode `` The Compassionate Society '' does feature an audio recording of Yesterday in Parliament in which Hacker speaks in the House of Commons , and other episodes include scenes in the Foreign Secretary 's House of Commons office ( `` The Writing on the Wall '' ) and a Committee room ( `` A Question of Loyalty '' ) . At the time of the making of the series , television cameras were not allowed in the House of Commons and had only recently been introduced into the House of Lords , so it was not unusual to a British audience to have no scenes from there .   Character contrast   The different ideals and self-interested motives of the characters are frequently contrasted . Whilst Hacker occasionally approaches an issue from a sense of idealism and a desire to be seen to improve things , he ultimately sees his re-election and elevation to higher office as the key measures of his success . Accordingly , he must appear to the voters to be effective and responsive to the public will ."], [461, "John Ronald Simm ( born 10 July 1970 ) is an award winning English actor .

It is located on the River Usk close to its confluence with the Severn estuary , approximately 12 mi northeast of Cardiff . At the 2011 census it is the third largest city in Wales , with a city population of 145,700 and an urban population of 306,844 . The city forms part of the Cardiff-Newport metropolitan area with a population of 1,097,000 .   Newport has been a port since medieval times , when Newport Castle was built by the Normans . The town outgrew the earlier Roman town of Caerleon , immediately upstream , and gained its first charter in 1314 . It grew significantly in the 19th century , when its port became the focus of coal exports from the eastern valleys of South Wales . Until the rise of Cardiff from the 1850s , Newport was Wales ' largest coal-exporting port . It was the site of the last large-scale armed insurrection in Britain , the Newport Rising of 1839 led by the Chartists .   During the 20th century , when the docks declined in importance , Newport remained an important manufacturing and engineering centre . It was granted city status in 2002 . Newport hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010 . The city was the venue of the 2014 NATO summit .   It is the largest urban area within the historic county boundaries of Monmouthshire and the preserved county of Gwent . The City of Newport , which includes some surrounding rural areas as well as the built up area , is governed by Newport City Council .   History   See also : Category : History of Newport , Wales   Origins   Bronze Age fishermen settled around the fertile estuary of the River Usk and later the Celtic Silures built hillforts overlooking it . In AD 75 , on the very edge of their empire , the Roman legions built a Roman fort at Caerleon to defend the river crossing . According to legend , in the late 5th century Saint Woolos church was founded by Saint Gwynllyw , the patron saint of Newport and King of Gwynllwg . The church was certainly in existence by the 9th century and today has become Newport Cathedral , the seat of the Bishop of Monmouth . The Normans arrived from around 1088–1093 to build Newport Castle and river crossing downstream and the first Norman Lord of Newport was Robert Fitzhamon .   The settlement of 'Newport ' is first mentioned as novo burgus established by Robert , Earl of Gloucester in 1126 . The name was derived from the original Latin name Novus Burgus , meaning new borough or new town . The city can sometimes be found labelled as Newport-on-Usk on old maps . The original Welsh language name for the city , Casnewydd-ar-Wysg ( pronounced ) means 'New castle-on-Usk ' ( this is a shortened version of Castell Newydd ar Wysg ) and this refers to the twelfth-century castle ruins near Newport city centre . The original Newport Castle was a small motte-and-bailey castle in the park opposite Newport Cathedral . It was buried in rubble excavated from the Hillfield railway tunnels that were dug under Stow Hill in the 1840s and no part of it is currently visible .   Around the settlement , the new town grew to become Newport , obtaining its first charter in 1314 and was granted a second one , by Hugh Stafford , 2nd Earl of Stafford in 1385 . In the 14th century friars came to Newport where they built an isolation hospital for infectious diseases . After its closure the hospital lived on in the place name `` Spitty Fields '' ( a corruption of ysbyty , the Welsh for hospital ) . `` Austin Friars '' also remains a street name in the city .   During the Welsh Revolt in 1402 Rhys Gethin , General for Owain Glyndŵr , forcibly took Newport Castle together with those at Cardiff , Llandaff , Abergavenny , Caerphilly , Caerleon and Usk . During the raid the town of Newport was badly burned and Saint Woolos church destroyed .   A third charter , establishing the right of the town to run its own market and commerce came from Humphrey Stafford , 1st Duke of Buckingham in 1426 . By 1521 , Newport was described as having `` .... a good haven coming into it , well occupied with small crays [ merchant ships ] where a very great ship may resort and have good harbour .

It was used in the United Kingdom , and earlier in Great Britain and England . Similar denominations were later used throughout the British Empire , notably in Australia , New Zealand , and South Africa .   The sum of three pence was pronounced variously , or , reflecting different pronunciations in the various regions and nations of the United Kingdom . Likewise , the coin was often referred to in conversation as a , or bit .   Before Decimal Day in 1971 there were two hundred and forty pence in one pound sterling . Twelve pence made a shilling , and twenty shillings made a pound . Values less than a pound were usually written in terms of shillings and pence , e.g . forty-two pence would be three shillings and six pence ( 3/6 ) , pronounced `` three and six '' . Values of less than a shilling were simply written in terms of pence , e.g . eight pence would be 8d .   Early threepences   The three pence coin – expressed in writing as `` 3d '' – first appeared in England during the fine silver coinage of King Edward VI ( 1547–53 ) , when it formed part of a set of new denominations . Although it was an easy denomination to work with in the context of the old sterling coinage system , being a quarter of a shilling , initially it was not popular with the public who preferred the groat ( four pence ) . Hence the coin was not minted in the following two reigns .   Edward VI threepences were struck at the London and York mints . The obverse shows a front-facing bust of the king , with a rose to the left and the value numeral III to the right , surrounded by the legend . The reverse shows a long cross over the royal shield , surrounded by the legend ( London mint ) ( I have made God my helper ) , or ( York mint ) ( City of York ) .   Queen Elizabeth I ( 1558–1603 ) produced threepences during her third coinage ( 1561–1577 ) . Most 1561 issues are 21 mm in diameter , while later ones are 19 mm in diameter . These coins are identifiable from other denominations by the rose behind the queen 's head on the obverse , and the date on the reverse . The obverse shows a left-facing crowned bust of the queen with a rose behind her , surrounded by the legend , while the reverse shows shield over a long cross , dated 1561 , surrounded by the legend . Dates used for the smaller coins were 1561–77 . Threepences of the fourth coinage ( 1578–1582 ) are identical except for having a slightly lower silver content . There was also a fairly rare milled coinage threepence , produced between 1561 and 1564 with similar designs and inscriptions to the hammered coinage threepences .   The threepence denomination fell out of use again during the reign of King James I , while during King Charles I 's reign ( 1625–49 ) it was not produced at the London Tower mint , but was produced ( sometimes in some quantity ) at various provincial mints . The denomination is identified by the numeral III appearing behind the king 's head .   Threepences reintroduced   By far the most common Charles I threepences were produced at the Aberystwyth mint between 1638 and 1642 . They feature a left-facing crowned bust of the king with plumes in front of his face and the numeral III behind him , with the legend ( or a combination of M ( A ) B F ( R ) ET H ( I ) ( B ) depending on the engraver ) , with the reverse showing the royal arms on a large oval shield with plumes above the shield , and the legend – I reign under the auspices of Christ . Plumes were the identifying symbol of the Aberystwyth mint , but the Bristol and Oxford mints often used dies from the Aberystwyth mint so plumes often appear on their output too . Milled coins were produced at the York mint between 1638 and 1649 , which look similar to the Aberystwyth product but without the plumes – the obverse features a left-facing crowned bust of the king with the numeral III behind him , with the legend"], [464, "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was established on 1 January 1801 under the terms of the Acts of Union 1800 , by which the separate kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland were united . In 1922 , about five-sixths of Ireland seceded to form the Irish Free State . Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom , and the state was consequently renamed the `` United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland '' .   The period began with the newly formed United Kingdom defeating the French Empire in 1814 in the Napoleonic Wars . The British Empire thereby became the foremost world power for the next century . Rapid industrialisation that began in the decades prior to the state 's formation continued up until the mid-19th century . In Ireland , this was focused along the eastern seaboard and north of the island , leading to deepening of economic and social disparities . A devastating famine , exacerbated by government inaction in the mid-19th century , led to demographic collapse in much of Ireland , and increased calls for Irish land reform and the devolution of executive power . During and after World War I , the rise of Irish nationalism and physical force republicanism eventually culminated in the Irish War of Independence , and in 1922 the partition of Ireland between the newly founded Irish Free State and the northeast , which opted to remain part of the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland . To reflect the change in the state 's boundaries , the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 amended the name of the UK Parliament to the `` Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland '' .   1801 to 1837   Union of Great Britain and Ireland   The Kingdom of Ireland was a settler state ; the monarch was the incumbent monarch of England and later of Great Britain . The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland headed the government on behalf of the monarch . He was assisted by the Chief Secretary of Ireland . Both were responsible to the government in London rather than to the Parliament of Ireland . Before the Constitution of 1782 , the Irish parliament was also severely fettered , and decisions in Irish courts could be overturned on appeal to the British House of Lords in London .   Ireland gained a degree of independence in the 1780s thanks to Henry Grattan . During this time the effects of the Penal Laws on the majority Roman Catholic population ( and the dissenter minority ) were reduced , and some property-owning Catholics were granted the franchise in 1794 ; however , they were still excluded from becoming members of the Irish House of Commons . This brief period of limited independence came to an end following the Irish Rebellion of 1798 , which occurred during the British war with revolutionary France . The British government 's fear of an independent Ireland siding against them with the French resulted in the decision to unite the two countries . This was brought about by legislation in the parliaments of both kingdoms and came into effect on 1 January 1801 . The Irish had been led to believe by the British that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated for with Catholic Emancipation , i.e . by the removal of civil disabilities placed upon Roman Catholics in both Great Britain and Ireland . However , King George III was bitterly opposed to any such Emancipation and succeeded in defeating his government 's attempts to introduce it .   Napoleonic Wars   During the War of the Second Coalition ( 1799–1801 ) , Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch overseas possessions , the Netherlands having become a satellite state of France in 1796 , but tropical diseases claimed the lives of over 40,000 troops . When the Treaty of Amiens ended the war , Britain agreed to return most of the territories it had seized . The peace settlement was in effect only a ceasefire , and Napoleon continued to provoke the British by attempting a trade embargo on the country and by occupying the city of Hanover , capital of the Electorate , a German-speaking duchy which was in a personal union with the United Kingdom . In May 1803 , war was declared again . Napoleon 's plans to invade Britain failed , chiefly due to the inferiority of his navy , and in 1805 Lord Nelson 's Royal Navy fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at Trafalgar , which was the last significant naval action of the Napoleonic Wars .   In 1806 , Napoleon issued the series of"], [465, "Russian literature refers to the literature of Russia and its émigrés and to the Russian-language literature of several independent nations once a part of what was historically Rus ' , Russian Empire or the Soviet Union . Roots of Russian literature can be traced to the Middle Ages , when epics and chronicles in Old Russian were composed . By the Age of Enlightenment , literature had grown in importance , and from the early 1830s , Russian literature underwent an astounding golden age in poetry , prose and drama . Romanticism permitted a flowering of poetic talent : Vasily Zhukovsky and later his protégé Alexander Pushkin came to the fore . Prose was flourishing as well . The first great Russian novelist was Nikolai Gogol . Then came Ivan Turgenev , who mastered both short stories and novels . Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky soon became internationally renowned . In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in short stories and became a leading dramatist . The beginning of the 20th century ranks as the Silver Age of Russian poetry . The poets most often associated with the `` Silver Age '' are Konstantin Balmont , Valery Bryusov , Alexander Blok , Anna Akhmatova , Nikolay Gumilyov , Osip Mandelstam , Sergei Yesenin , Vladimir Mayakovsky , Marina Tsvetaeva and Boris Pasternak . This era produced some first-rate novelists and short-story writers , such as Aleksandr Kuprin , Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin , Leonid Andreyev , Fedor Sologub , Aleksey Remizov , Yevgeny Zamyatin , Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Andrei Bely .   After the Revolution of 1917 , Russian literature split into Soviet and white émigré parts . While the Soviet Union assured universal literacy and a highly developed book printing industry , it also enforced ideological censorship . In the 1930s Socialist realism became the predominant trend in Russia . Its leading figure was Maxim Gorky , who laid the foundations of this style . Nikolay Ostrovsky 's novel How the Steel Was Tempered has been among the most successful works of Russian literature . Alexander Fadeyev achieved success in Russia . Various émigré writers , such as poets Vladislav Khodasevich , Georgy Ivanov and Vyacheslav Ivanov ; novelists such as Mark Aldanov , Gaito Gazdanov and Vladimir Nabokov ; and short story Nobel Prize-winning writer Ivan Bunin , continued to write in exile . Some writers dared to oppose Soviet ideology , like Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn , who wrote about life in the gulag camps . The Khrushchev Thaw brought some fresh wind to literature and poetry became a mass cultural phenomenon . This `` thaw '' did not last long ; in the 1970s , some of the most prominent authors were banned from publishing and prosecuted for their anti-Soviet sentiments .   The end of the 20th century was a difficult period for Russian literature , with few distinct voices . Among the most discussed authors of this period were Victor Pelevin , who gained popularity with short stories and novels , novelist and playwright Vladimir Sorokin , and the poet Dmitry Prigov . In the 21st century , a new generation of Russian authors appeared , differing greatly from the postmodernist Russian prose of the late 20th century , which lead critics to speak about “ new realism ” . Leading `` new realists '' include Ilja Stogoff , Zakhar Prilepin , Alexander Karasyov , Arkadi Babchenko , Vladimir Lorchenkov , Alexander Snegiryov and the political author Sergej Shargunov .   Russian authors significantly contributed almost to all known genres of the literature . Russia has five Nobel Prize in literature laureates . As of 2011 , Russia was the fourth largest book producer in the world in terms of published titles . A popular folk saying claims Russians are `` the world 's most reading nation '' . `` When mass illiteracy was finally liquidated in the first half of the twentieth century , the proud self-image of Russians as “ the most reading nation in the world ” emerged - where reading meant , and still means for many , the reading of literature '' .   Early history   Old Russian literature consists of several masterpieces written in the Old Russian language ( i.e . the language of Rus ' , not to be confused with the contemporaneous Church Slavonic or modern Russian ) . Main type of Old Russian historical literature were chronicles , most of them were anonymous . Anonymous works also include The Tale of Igor 's Campaign and Praying of Daniel the Immured . Hagiographies ( , zhitiya svyatykh , `` lives of the saints '' ) formed a popular genre of the Old Russian literature ."], [466, "The queen of spades ( Q ) is one of 52 playing cards in a standard deck : the queen of the suit of spades ( ) .   Roles by game   In the game of Hearts , the queen of spades is usually considered an unlucky card . The player who ends up with the queen of spades after a match scores 13 points ( points are to be avoided in this game ) . The exception is when the player receives this card with all 13 hearts , in which the player is said to have shot the moon , and this player scores no points , while all opponents are scored 26 points .   In the game of Old Maid , while any card can technically be used for this purpose , the queen of spades is traditionally used as a card that has no match , thereby making it the `` old maid '' card .   Card reading   In cartomancy , the queen of spades is considered to be a sign of intelligence . It is representative of judgment that is practical , logical , and intellectual . It represents a woman who is creative and makes her plans ahead of time ."], [467, "George Smiley is a fictional character created by John le Carré . Smiley is an intelligence officer working for `` The Circus '' , the British overseas intelligence agency . He is a central character in the novels Call for the Dead , A Murder of Quality , Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy , The Honourable Schoolboy , and Smiley 's People , and a supporting character in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold , The Looking Glass War and The Secret Pilgrim .   Early life   Although Smiley has no concrete biography beyond that offered briefly at the beginning of Call for the Dead , le Carré does leave clues in his novels .   Smiley was probably born around 1906 ( or 1915 on the revised chronology ) to middle class parents in the South of England , and attended a minor public school and an antiquated Oxford college of no real distinction ( in the 1982 BBC television adaptation of Smiley 's People , he refers to himself as a fellow of Lincoln College ) , studying modern languages with a particular focus on Baroque German literature . In July 1928 , while considering post-graduate study in that field , he was recruited into the Circus by his tutor Jebedee .   He underwent training and probation in Central Europe and South America , and spent the period from 1935 until approximately 1938 in Germany recruiting networks under cover as a lecturer . In 1939 , with the commencement of World War II , he saw active service not only in Germany , but also in Switzerland and Sweden . Smiley 's wartime superiors described him as having `` the cunning of Satan and the conscience of a virgin '' .   In 1943 , he was recalled to England to work at Circus headquarters , and in 1945 successfully proposed marriage to Lady Ann Sercomb , a beautiful , aristocratic , and libidinous young lady working as a secretary there . Ann would prove a most unfaithful and rather condescending wife . In the same year , Smiley left the Service and returned to Oxford . However , in 1947 , with the onset of the Cold War , Smiley was asked to return to the Service , and in early 1951 moved into counter-intelligence work , where he would remain for the next decade . During that period , Smiley first met his Soviet nemesis , Karla , in a Delhi prison . Karla proved impossible to crack , taking Smiley 's lighter for good measure , a gift to Smiley from wife Ann .   In the novels   The early novels   Smiley first appeared in Call for the Dead , le Carré 's debut novel . At the start of the novel , set around 1960 , Smiley has fallen from grace and is working in a relatively menial intelligence job , including security-clearing civil servants . He spends much of the story bemoaning the loss of the talented agents who were his mentors and their replacement by such talentless civil-service bureaucrats as the current head of service , Maston , who refers to himself as the `` Ministers ' Adviser on Intelligence '' and is widely , if secretly , mocked . Over the course of the story , Smiley resigns from the Circus in anger on the spur of the moment while unravelling an East German spy ring , clearing his own name in so doing , and restoring his reputation while remaining in retirement at tale 's end , despite Maston 's pleadings . It is while pursuing a sedate life of scholastic research in German literature at a university in the West Country ( probably Exeter ) that he is called upon to investigate a murder at a fictional public school in le Carré 's next novel , A Murder of Quality .   Le Carré was propelled to international renown by The Spy Who Came in from the Cold , his third novel . Smiley , a minor but pivotal character in the story , still retired , but revealed during the story to be back in the Circus as one of the top aides to `` Control '' , Maston 's mysterious successor as the Circus ' chief . Smiley and his assistant Peter Guillam have actually turned the brutal head of East German intelligence into a British double agent . The events in this book take place around 1962 , after the construction of the Berlin Wall .   Smiley appears again in The Looking Glass War , le Carré 's fourth novel , though only in a peripheral role , occupying the"], [468, "Venice ( ; ) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region . It is situated across a group of 117 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by bridges . These are located in the marshy Venetian Lagoon which stretches along the shoreline , between the mouths of the Po and the Piave Rivers . Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their settings , their architecture , and artwork . The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a World Heritage Site .   In 2009 , 270,098 people resided in Venice 's comune ( the population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia ; of whom around 60,000 live in the historic city of Venice ( Centro storico ) ; 176,000 in Terraferma ( the mainland ) , mostly in the large frazioni ( roughly equivalent to `` parishes '' or `` wards '' in other countries ) of Mestre and Marghera ; and 31,000 on other islands in the lagoon ) . Together with Padua and Treviso , the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area ( PATREVE ) , with a total population of 2,600,000 . PATREVE is only a statistical metropolitan area without any degree of autonomy .   The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC . The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice . Venice has been known as the `` La Dominante '' , `` Serenissima '' , `` Queen of the Adriatic '' , `` City of Water '' , `` City of Masks '' , `` City of Bridges '' , `` The Floating City '' , and `` City of Canals '' .   The Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance , and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto , as well as a very important center of commerce ( especially silk , grain , and spice ) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century . This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history . It is also known for its several important artistic movements , especially the Renaissance period . After the Napoleonic Wars and the Congress of Vienna , the Republic was annexed by the Austrian Empire , until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 , following a referendum held as a result of the Third Italian War of Independence . Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music , and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi .   Etymology   The name of the city , deriving from Latin forms Venetia and Venetiae , is most likely taken from `` Venetia et Histria '' , the Roman name of Regio X of Roman Italy , but applied to the coastal part of the region that remained under Roman Empire outside of Gothic , Lombard , and Frankish control . The name Venetia , however , derives from the Roman name for the people known as the Veneti , and called by the Greeks Eneti ( Ἐνετοί ) . The meaning of the word is uncertain , although there are other Indo-European tribes with similar-sounding names , such as the Celtic Veneti , Baltic Veneti , and the Slavic Wends . Linguists suggest that the name is based on an Indo-European root * wen ( `` love '' ) , so that * wenetoi would mean `` beloved '' , `` lovable '' , or `` friendly '' . A connection with the Latin word venetus , meaning the color 'sea-blue ' , is also possible .  Supposed connections of Venetia with the Latin verb venire ( to come ) , such as Marin Sanudo 's veni etiam ( `` Yet , I have come ! `` ) , the supposed cry of the first refugees to the Venetian lagoon from the mainland , or even with venia ( `` forgiveness '' ) are fanciful . The alternative obsolete form is Vinegia ; ( Venetian : Venèxia ; ; ) .   History   Origins   Although no surviving historical records deal directly with the founding of Venice , tradition and the available evidence have led several historians to agree that the original population of Venice consisted of refugees from Roman cities near Venice such as Padua , Aquileia , Treviso , Altino and Concordia ( modern Portogruaro ) and from the undefended countryside , who were fleeing successive waves"], [469, "A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft , as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft , whose main mission is to attack ground targets . The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed , maneuverability , and small size relative to other combat aircraft .   Many fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities , and some are designed as dual-purpose fighter-bombers ; often aircraft that do not fulfill the standard definition are called fighters . This may be for political or national security reasons , for advertising purposes , or other reasons .   A fighter 's main purpose is to establish air superiority over a battlefield . Since World War I , achieving and maintaining air superiority has been considered essential for victory in conventional warfare . The success or failure of a belligerent 's efforts to gain air supremacy hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots , the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters , and the numbers and performance of those fighters . Because of the importance of air superiority , since the dawn of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers , and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces .   Terminology   The word `` fighter '' did not become the official English-language term for such aircraft until after World War I . In the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force these aircraft were referred to as `` scouts '' into the early 1920s . The U.S. Army called their fighters `` pursuit '' aircraft from 1916 until the late 1940s . In most languages a fighter aircraft is known as a hunter , or hunting aircraft ( avion de chasse , jagdflugzeuge , avión de caza etc . ) . Exceptions include Russian , where a fighter is an `` истребитель '' ( pronounced `` istrebitel '' ) , meaning `` exterminator '' , and Hebrew where it is `` matose krav '' ( literally `` battle plane '' ) .   As a part of military nomenclature , a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use , along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft . The letters used to designate a fighter differ in various countries — in the English-speaking world , `` F '' is now used to indicate a fighter ( e.g . F-35 or Spitfire F.22 ) , though when the pursuit designation was used in the US , they were `` P '' types ( e.g . P-40 ) . In Russia `` I '' was used ( I-16 ) , while the French continue to use `` C '' ( Nieuport 17 C.1 ) .   Although the term `` fighter '' specifies aircraft designed to shoot down other aircraft , such designs are often also useful as multirole fighter-bombers , strike fighters , and sometimes lighter , fighter-sized tactical ground-attack aircraft . This has always been the case , for instance the Sopwith Camel and other `` fighting scouts '' of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work . In World War II , the USAAF and RAF often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or dive bombers , and types such as the P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Hurricane that were no longer competitive aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack . Several aircraft , such as the F-111 and F-117 , have received fighter designations but had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons . The F-111B variant was originally intended for a fighter role with the U.S. Navy , but it was cancelled . This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for `` attack '' or `` strike '' operations against ground targets by means of strafing or dropping small bombs and incendiaries . Versatile multirole fighter-bombers such as the F/A-18 Hornet are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types .   Some of the most expensive fighters such as the US F-14 Tomcat , F-15 Eagle , F-22 Raptor and Russian Su-27 were employed as all-weather interceptors as well as air superiority fighter aircraft , while commonly developing air-to-ground roles late in their careers . An interceptor is generally an aircraft intended to target ( or intercept ) bombers and so often trades maneuverability for climb rate .   Development overview   Fighters were developed in World War I to deny enemy aircraft and dirigibles the ability to gather information by reconnaissance ."], [470, "Tommy and Tuppence are two fictional detectives , recurring characters in the work of Agatha Christie . Their full names are Thomas Beresford and Prudence Beresford ( née Cowley ) .  The first time Tommy and Tuppence appeared in a Christie novel was in The Secret Adversary ( 1922 ) . They started out their career as accidental blackmailers ( all in search of adventure and money ) , but the detecting life soon proved more profitable and much more exciting .   Novels   Tommy and Tuppence appear together in four full-length novels and one collection of short stories The collection of short stories is Partners in Crime , ( 1929 , each story reminiscent of another writer 's work ) ; the four novels are The Secret Adversary ( 1922 ) , N or M ? ( 1941 ) , By the Pricking of My Thumbs ( 1968 ) ; and Postern of Fate ( 1973 ) . Postern of Fate was the last novel Christie ever wrote , although not the last to be published .   Detectives   Tuppence appears as a charismatic , impulsive and intuitive person , while Tommy is less imaginative , and less likely to be diverted from the truth ( as their first adversary sums him up `` he is not clever , but it is hard to blind his eyes to the facts '' ) . They therefore make a good team . It is in this first book The Secret Adversary that they meet up after the war , and come to realise that , although they have been friends for most of their lives , they have now fallen in love with each other .   Unlike many other recurring detective characters , including the better known Christie detectives , Tommy and Tuppence aged in time with the real world , being in their early twenties in The Secret Adversary and in their seventies in Postern of Fate . In their early appearances , they are portrayed as typical upper middle class `` bright young things '' of the 1920s , and the stories and settings have a more pronounced period-specific flavour than the stories featuring the better known Christie characters . As they age , they 're revealed to have raised three children – twins Deborah and Derek and an adopted daughter , Betty . Throughout the series they employ a man named Albert , who first appears as a lift boy who helps them in The Secret Adversary ; and subsequently , as a now married pub owner , renders vital assistance to the pair in N or M ? . In Partners in Crime , Albert becomes their hapless assistant at a private detective agency ; by Postern of Fate he 's their butler and has now been widowed . In Postern of Fate they also have a small dog named Hannibal .   Adaptations   In 1953 the BBC adapted Partners in Crime as a radio series starring Richard Attenborough and Sheila Sim .   The Tommy and Tuppence characters have been portrayed on television by James Warwick and Francesca Annis , first in the feature-length The Secret Adversary ( 1982 ) , and then in the 10 episode series Agatha Christie 's Partners in Crime ( 1983 ) .   The novel By the Pricking of My Thumbs was adapted in 2005 by the French director Pascal Thomas with the title Mon petit doigt m ' a dit .... The movie casts André Dussolier as Tommy ( renamed Bélisaire ) and Catherine Frot as Prudence Beresford . The action is transposed to Savoie in France . A second movie , Le crime est notre affaire , came out in 2008 . Le crime est notre affaire is named after Partners in Crime and stars the Beresfords , but its story is based on 4.50 From Paddington , which was originally a novel starring Miss Marple . A third film Associés contre le crime is very , very loosely based ( to the point of being unrecognisable ) on one of the stories in Partners in Crime .   An adaptation of By the Pricking of My Thumbs appeared in 2006 as an episode of the Granada television series Marple even though Christie did not write Marple into the original story . In this version , Tommy and Tuppence were played by Anthony Andrews and Greta Scacchi respectively , but , unlike in the book , Miss Marple and Tuppence play the detective roles while Tommy is away on intelligence ( MI6 ) business .   BBC television began broadcasting two adaptations , comprising six episodes in 2015 .

Held in the United Kingdom , it is administered by The R & A and is the only major outside the United States . The Open is currently the third major of the year , between the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship , and is played in mid-July .   The current champion is Henrik Stenson , who won the 145th Open at Royal Troon in 2016 with a record-breaking score of −20 .   History   The Open was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club in Scotland . The inaugural tournament was restricted to professionals and attracted a field of eight golfers who played three rounds of Prestwick 's twelve-hole course in a single day . Willie Park Sr. won with a score of 174 , beating Old Tom Morris , by two strokes . The following year the tournament was opened to amateurs ; eight of them joined ten professionals in the field .   James Ogilvie Fairlie was the principal organiser of the first Open Championship held at Prestwick in 1860 . With the untimely death of Allan Robertson , aged 43 in 1859 , Prestwick members decided to conduct a challenge the following year that would determine the land ’ s greatest golfer . In a proposed competition for a `` Challenge Belt '' , Fairlie sent out a series of letters to Blackheath , Perth , Edinburgh , Musselburgh and St Andrews , inviting a player known as a `` respectable caddie '' to represent each of the clubs in a tournament to be held on 17 October 1860 .   Originally , the trophy presented to the event 's winner was the Challenge Belt , a red leather belt with a silver buckle . The Challenge Belt was retired in 1870 , when Young Tom Morris was allowed to keep it for winning the tournament three consecutive times . Because no trophy was available , the tournament was cancelled in 1871 . In 1872 , after Young Tom Morris won again for a fourth time in a row , he was awarded a medal . The present trophy , The Golf Champion Trophy , better known by its popular name of the Claret Jug , was then created .   Prestwick administered The Open from 1860 to 1870 . In 1871 , it agreed to organise it jointly with The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers . In 1892 the event was doubled in length from 36 to 72 holes , four rounds of what was by then the standard complement of 18 holes . The 1894 Open was the first held outside Scotland , at the Royal St George 's Golf Club in England . Because of an increasing number of entrants , a cut was introduced after two rounds in 1898 . In 1920 full responsibility for The Open Championship was handed over to The Royal & Ancient Golf Club .   The early winners were all Scottish professionals , who in those days worked as greenkeepers , clubmakers , and caddies to supplement their modest winnings from championships and challenge matches . The Open has always been dominated by professionals , with only six victories by amateurs , all of which occurred between 1890 and 1930 . The last of these was Bobby Jones ' third Open and part of his celebrated Grand Slam . Jones was one of six Americans who won The Open between the First and Second World Wars , the first of whom had been Walter Hagen in 1922 . These Americans and the French winner of the 1907 Open , Arnaud Massy , were the only winners from outside Scotland and England up to 1939 .   The first post-World War II winner was the American Sam Snead , in 1946 . In 1947 , Northern Ireland 's Fred Daly was victorious . While there have been many English and Scottish champions , Daly was the only winner from Ireland until the 2007 victory by Pádraig Harrington . There has never been a Welsh champion . In the early postwar years The Open was dominated by golfers from the Commonwealth , with South African Bobby Locke and Australian Peter Thomson winning the Claret Jug in eight of the 11 championships from 1948 and 1958 between them . During this period , The Open often had a schedule conflict with the match-play PGA Championship , which meant that Ben Hogan , the best American golfer at this time"], [472, "Charles Edward Springall , known professionally as Charlie Drake ( 19 June 1925 – 23 December 2006 ) was an English comedian , actor , writer and singer .   With his small stature ( 5 ' 1 '' /155 cm tall ) , curly red hair and liking for slapstick , he was a popular comedian with children in his early years , becoming nationally known for his `` Hello , my darlings ! '' catchphrase .   Early life   Born Charles Edward Springall in the Elephant and Castle , Southwark , South London , he took his mother 's maiden name for the stage and , later , television and film , achieving success as a comedian .   Career   Drake made his first appearance on stage at the age of eight , and after leaving school toured working men 's clubs . After serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War , Drake turned professional and made his television début in The Centre Show in 1953 . He then joined his wartime comrade Jack Edwardes to form a double act , named 'Mick and Montmorency ' . In 1954 he appeared with Bob Monkhouse in the film , Fast and Loose .   He appeared in the television shows Laughter in Store ( 1957 ) , Drake 's Progress ( 1957–58 ) , Charlie Drake In… ( 1958 to 1960 ) and The Charlie Drake Show ( 1960 to 1961 ) , being remembered for his opening catchphrase `` Hello , my darlings ! '' The catchphrase came about because he was short , and so his eyes would often be naturally directly level with a lady 's bosom . Because of this and because in his television work he preferred appearing with big-busted women , the catchphrase was born .   The later series was ended , however , by a serious accident that occurred in 1961 , during a live transmission . Drake had arranged for a bookcase to be set up in such a way that it would fall apart during a slapstick sketch in which he was pulled through it . It was later discovered that an over-enthusiastic workman had `` mended '' the bookcase before the broadcast . The actors working with him , unaware of what had happened , proceeded with the rest of the sketch which required that they pick him up and throw him through an open window . Drake fractured his skull and was unconscious for three days . It was two years before he returned to the screen .   Television fame led to four films , none of them successful — Sands of the Desert ( 1960 ) , Petticoat Pirates ( 1961 ) , The Cracksman ( 1963 ) and Mister Ten Per Cent ( 1967 ) . He returned to television in 1963 with The Charlie Drake Show , a compilation of which won an award at the Montreux Festival in 1968 . The centrepiece of this was an extended sketch featuring an orchestra performing the 1812 Overture , in which Drake appeared to play all the instruments ; as well as conducting and one scene in which he was the player of a triangle waiting for his cue to play a single strike – which he subsequently missed .   Through the series he played a gymnast doing a single arm twist from a high ring while a commentator counted eventually into the thousands and by the end of the series , Drake 's arm appeared to be 20 ft long . Other shows included Who is Sylvia ( 1967 ) and Slapstick and Old Lace ( 1971 ) , but it was The Worker ( 1965 to 1970 ) that gained most acclaim .   He was the subject of This Is Your Life on two occasions , in December 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in a rehearsal room at the London Palladium , and in November 1995 , when Michael Aspel surprised him at the curtain call of the comedy play Funny Money at the Playhouse Theatre .   The Worker   In The Worker ( ATV/ITV , 1965–70 ) he played a perpetually unemployed labourer who , in every episode , was dispatched to a new job by the ever-frustrated clerk ( firstly Mr Whitaker in series one , played by Percy Herbert , and from series two onwards Mr Pugh , played by Henry McGee ) at the local labour exchange . All the jobs he embarked upon ended in disaster , sometimes with a burst of classic slapstick , sometimes with a bewildered Drake himself at the centre"], [473, "The Chakri Dynasty ( ; , , [ http : //www.forvo.com/word/ราชวงศ์จักรี/ # th Pronunciation ] ) is the current ruling royal house of the Kingdom of Thailand , while the Head of the house is the King of Thailand . The dynasty has ruled Thailand since the founding of the Rattanakosin Era and the city of Bangkok in 1782 following the end of King Taksin of Thonburi 's reign , when the capital of Siam shifted to Bangkok . The royal house was founded by King Rama I , an Ayutthayan military leader of Sino-Mon descent .   Prior to the founding of the dynasty , King Rama I held for years the title Chakri , the title of the civil chancellor ( สมุหนายก ) . In founding the dynasty , King Rama I himself chose `` Chakri '' as the name for the dynasty . The emblem of the dynasty is composed of the discus ( Chakra ) and the trident ( Trisula ) , the celestial weapons of god Vishnu and Shiva , whom the Thai sovereign is seen as an incarnation .   The current head of the house has been King Bhumibol Adulyadej since 1946 , while his heir apparent is Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn . The house 's current dynastic seat is the Grand Palace in Bangkok .   Royal Family of Thailand   The present royal family of Thailand is descended from Prince Mahidol Adulyadej of Songkla ( 1891–1929 ) and Srinagarindra ( later Princess Mother ) ( 1900–95 ) forming the House of Mahidol ( ราชสกุลมหิดล ) ( a cadet branch of the dynasty ) . The Prince was a son of King Chulalongkorn and his wife Queen Savang Vadhana . The Prince was also the half-brother of both King Vajiravudh and King Prajadhipok . After the death of King Ananda Mahidol ( Prince Mahidol 's elder son ) , the present monarch , King Bhumibol Adulyadej ( the Prince 's younger son ) ascended the throne in 1946 .

Location   Located on the coast of the North Sea , its central location on the Belgian coast , short distance to Great Britain and close vicinity to densely populated industrialised cities make Zeebrugge a crossroads for traffic from all directions . An expressway to Bruges connects Zeebrugge to the European motorway system ; one can also get to and from Zeebrugge by train or tram .   It is Belgium 's most important fishing port and the wholesale fish market located there is one of the largest in Europe .   Aside from being a passenger terminal with ferries to the United Kingdom , the harbour serves as the central port for Europe 's automotive industry , and it is important for the import , handling and storage of energy products , agriculture products and other general cargo . Zeebrugge has the largest LNG terminal complex in Europe .   History   The harbour was the site of the Zeebrugge Raid on 23 April 1918 , when the British Royal Navy temporarily put the German inland naval base at Bruges out of action . Admiral Roger Keyes planned and led the raid that stormed the German batteries and sank three old warships at the entrance to the canal leading to the inland port . This action blocked access to the port and prevented U-boats and other shipping from using it . The raid , although a morale boosting victory in Britain , was only a partial military success .

Together with then-US President George W. Bush , he initiated the Iraq War with the invasion of Iraq , an act which remains highly controversial .   From 1983 to 2007 , Blair was the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994 , following the sudden death of his predecessor , John Smith . Under Blair 's leadership , the party used the phrase `` New Labour '' , to distance it from previous Labour policies and the traditional conception of socialism . Blair declared support for a new conception that he referred to as `` social-ism '' , involving politics that recognised individuals as socially interdependent , and advocated social justice , cohesion , equal worth of each citizen , and equal opportunity . Critics of Blair denounced him for having the Labour Party abandon genuine socialism and accepting capitalism .   In May 1997 , the Labour Party won a landslide general election victory , the largest in its history , allowing Blair , at 43 years old , to become the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812 . In September 1997 , Blair attained early personal popularity , receiving a 93 % public approval rating , after his public response to the death of Diana , Princess of Wales . The Labour Party went on to win two more elections under his leadership : in 2001 , in which it won another landslide victory , and in 2005 , with a reduced majority . In the first years of the New Labour government , Blair 's government introduced the National Minimum Wage Act , Human Rights Act , and Freedom of Information Act . Blair 's government also carried out the devolution , the establishing of the Scottish Parliament , the National Assembly for Wales , and the Northern Ireland Assembly , thus fulfilling four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto . In Northern Ireland , Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement .   Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration , and ensured that British Armed Forces participated in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and , more controversially , the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Blair has faced strong criticism for his role in the invasion of Iraq , including calls for having him tried for war crimes and waging a war of aggression . In 2016 the Iraq Inquiry strongly criticised his actions and described the invasion of Iraq as unjustified and unnecessary .   Blair was succeeded as the leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007 , and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by Gordon Brown . On the day that Blair resigned as Prime Minister , he was appointed the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East , which he held until 27 May 2015 . He now runs a consultancy business and has set up various foundations in his own name , including the Tony Blair Faith Foundation .   Early life   Blair was born in Edinburgh , Scotland , on 6 May 1953 , the second son of Leo and Hazel ( Corscadden ) Blair . Leo Blair , the illegitimate son of two English actors , had been adopted as a baby by Glasgow shipyard worker James Blair and his wife , Mary . Hazel Corscadden was the daughter of George Corscadden , a butcher and Orangeman who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to ( and later died in ) Ballyshannon , County Donegal in 1923 , where his wife , Sarah Margaret ( née Lipsett ) , gave birth to Blair 's mother , Hazel , above the family 's grocery shop .   Blair has one elder brother , Sir William Blair , a High Court judge , and a younger sister , Sarah . Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh . During this period , his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the University of Edinburgh .   In the 1950s , his family spent three and a half years in Adelaide , South Australia , where his father was a lecturer in law at the University of Adelaide . The Blairs lived close to the university , in the suburb of Dulwich . The family returned"], [476, "George I ( George Louis ; ; 28 May 1660 – 11 June 1727 ) was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 1 August 1714 until his death , and ruler of the Duchy and Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg ( Hanover ) in the Holy Roman Empire from 1698 .   George was born in Hanover and inherited the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg from his father and uncles . A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime , and in 1708 he was ratified as prince-elector of Hanover . At the age of 54 , after the death of Queen Anne of Great Britain , George ascended the British throne as the first monarch of the House of Hanover . Although over fifty Roman Catholics bore closer blood relationships to Anne , the Act of Settlement 1701 prohibited Catholics from inheriting the British throne ; George was Anne 's closest living Protestant relative . In reaction , Jacobites attempted to depose George and replace him with Anne 's Catholic half-brother , James Francis Edward Stuart , but their attempts failed .   During George 's reign , the powers of the monarchy diminished and Britain began a transition to the modern system of cabinet government led by a prime minister . Towards the end of his reign , actual power was held by Sir Robert Walpole , now recognised as Britain 's first de facto prime minister . George died on a trip to his native Hanover , where he was buried .   Early life   George was born on 28 May 1660 in Hanover in the Holy Roman Empire . He was the eldest son of Ernest Augustus , Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg , and his wife , Sophia of the Palatinate . Sophia was the granddaughter of King James I of England through her mother , Elizabeth of Bohemia .   For the first year of his life , George was the only heir to the German territories of his father and three childless uncles . In 1661 George 's brother , Frederick Augustus , was born and the two boys ( known as Görgen and Gustchen within the family ) were brought up together . Their mother was absent for almost a year ( 1664–65 ) during a long convalescent holiday in Italy , but she corresponded regularly with her sons ' governess and took a great interest in her sons ' upbringing , even more so on her return . After Sophia 's tour she bore Ernest Augustus another four sons and a daughter . In her letters , Sophia describes George as a responsible , conscientious child who set an example to his younger brothers and sisters .   By 1675 George 's eldest uncle had died without issue , but his remaining two uncles had married , putting George 's inheritance in jeopardy as his uncles ' estates might pass to their own sons , should they have had any , instead of to George . George 's father took him hunting and riding , and introduced him to military matters ; mindful of his uncertain future , Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the Franco-Dutch War with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle .   In 1679 another uncle died unexpectedly without sons and Ernest Augustus became reigning Duke of Calenberg-Göttingen , with his capital at Hanover . George 's surviving uncle , George William of Celle , had married his mistress in order to legitimise his only daughter , Sophia Dorothea of Celle , but looked unlikely to have any further children . Under Salic law , where inheritance of territory was restricted to the male line , the succession of George and his brothers to the territories of their father and uncle now seemed secure . In 1682 , the family agreed to adopt the principle of primogeniture , meaning George would inherit all the territory and not have to share it with his brothers .   Marriage   The same year , George married his first cousin , Sophia Dorothea of Celle , thereby securing additional incomes that would have been outside Salic laws . The marriage of state was arranged primarily as it ensured a healthy annual income and assisted the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle . His mother was at first against the marriage because she looked down on Sophia Dorothea 's mother ( who was not of royal birth ) , and because she was concerned by Sophia Dorothea 's legitimated status . She was eventually won over by the advantages inherent in the marriage .   In 1683 ,"], [477, "The Nobel Prize ( , ; Swedish definite form , singular : Nobelpriset ; ) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian committees in recognition of academic , cultural and/or scientific advances .   The will of the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel established the prizes in 1895 . The prizes in Chemistry , Literature , Peace , Physics , and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901 . The related Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established by Sweden 's central bank in 1968 . Medals made before 1980 were struck in 23 carat gold , and later from 18 carat green gold plated with a 24 carat gold coating . Between 1901 and 2015 , the Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 573 times to 900 people and organizations . With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once , this makes a total of 870 individuals ( 822 men and 48 women ) and 23 organizations .   The prize ceremonies take place annually in Stockholm , Sweden , except for the peace prize which is held in Oslo , Norway and each recipient , or laureate , receives a gold medal , a diploma and a sum of money that has been decided by the Nobel Foundation . ( , each prize was worth SEK8 million or about , €0.93 million or £0.6 million . ) The Nobel Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in the fields of literature , medicine , physics , chemistry , peace , and economics .   The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Nobel Prize in Physics , the Nobel Prize in Chemistry , and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences ; the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet awards the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ; the Swedish Academy grants the Nobel Prize in Literature ; and the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded not by a Swedish organisation but by the Norwegian Nobel Committee .   The prize is not awarded posthumously ; however , if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it , the prize may still be presented . Though the average number of laureates per prize increased substantially during the 20th century , a prize may not be shared among more than three people .   History   Alfred Nobel ( ) was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm , Sweden , into a family of engineers . He was a chemist , engineer , and inventor . In 1894 , Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill , which he made into a major armaments manufacturer . Nobel also invented ballistite . This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives , especially the British smokeless powder cordite . As a consequence of his patent claims , Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite . Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime , with most of his wealth from his 355 inventions , of which dynamite is the most famous .   In 1888 , Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary , titled The merchant of death is dead , in a French newspaper . As it was Alfred 's brother Ludvig who had died , the obituary was eight years premature . The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered . This inspired him to change his will . On 10 December 1896 , Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo , Italy , from a cerebral haemorrhage . He was 63 years old .   Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime . He composed the last over a year before he died , signing it at the Swedish–Norwegian Club in Paris on 27 November 1895 . To widespread astonishment , Nobel 's last will specified that his fortune be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the `` greatest benefit on mankind '' in physics , chemistry , physiology or medicine , literature , and peace .

US $ 186 million , €150 million in 2008 ) , to establish the five Nobel Prizes .  Because of scepticism surrounding the will , it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting in Norway . The executors of Nobel 's will , Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist , formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel 's"], [478, "A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative , often serialized , with text in balloons and captions . Traditionally , throughout the 20th century and into the 21st , these have been published in newspapers and magazines , with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers , while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections . With the development of the internet , they began to appear online as web comics .   There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century , for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes .   Strips are written and drawn by a comics artist or cartoonist . As the name implies , comic strips can be humorous ( for example , `` gag-a-day '' strips such as Blondie , Bringing Up Father , Marmaduke , and Pearls Before Swine ) .   Starting in the late 1920s , comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories , as seen in Popeye , Captain Easy , Buck Rogers , Tarzan , and The Adventures of Tintin . Soap-opera continuity strips such as Judge Parker and Mary Worth gained popularity in the 1940s . All are called , generically , comic strips , though cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that `` sequential art '' would be a better genre-neutral name .   In the UK and the rest of Europe , comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines , with a strip 's story sometimes continuing over three pages or more . Comic strips have appeared in American magazines such as Liberty and Boys ' Life and also on the front covers of magazines , such as the Flossy Frills series on The American Weekly Sunday newspaper supplement .   History   Storytelling using a sequence of pictures has existed through history . One medieval European example in textile form is the Bayeux Tapestry . Printed examples emerged in 19th-century Germany and in 18th-century England , where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced . William Hogarth 's 18th century English cartoons include both narrative sequences , such as A Rake 's Progress , and single panels .   The Biblia pauperum ( `` Paupers ' Bible '' ) , a tradition of picture Bibles beginning in the later Middle Ages , sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the miniatures written on scrolls coming out of their mouths—which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips .   In China , with its traditions of block printing and of the incorporation of text with image , experiments with what became lianhuanhua date back to 1884 .   Newspapers   The first newspaper comic strips appeared in North America in the late 19th century . The Yellow Kid is usually credited as the first . However , the art form combining words and pictures developed gradually and there are many examples which led up to the comic strip .   Swiss author and caricature artist Rodolphe Töpffer ( Geneva , 1799–1846 ) is considered the father of the modern comic strips . His illustrated stories such as Histoire de M. Vieux Bois ( 1827 ) , first published in the USA in 1842 as The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck or Histoire de Monsieur Jabot ( 1831 ) , inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists . In 1865 , German painter , author , and caricaturist Wilhelm Busch created the strip Max and Moritz , about two trouble-making boys , which had a direct influence on the American comic strip . Max and Moritz was a series of severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children 's stories such as Struwwelpeter ( `` Shockheaded Peter '' ) ; in one , the boys , after perpetrating some mischief , are tossed into a sack of grain , run through a mill , and consumed by a flock of geese . Max and Moritz provided an inspiration for German immigrant Rudolph Dirks , who created the Katzenjammer Kids in 1897 . Familiar comic-strip iconography such as stars for pain , sawing logs for snoring , speech balloons , and thought balloons originated in Dirks ' strip .   Hugely popular , Katzenjammer Kids occasioned one of the first comic-strip copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium . When Dirks left William Randolph Hearst for the promise of a better salary under Joseph Pulitzer , it was an unusual move"], [479, "William Shakespeare ( ; 26 April 1564 ( baptised ) – 23 April 1616 ) was an English : poet , : playwright , and actor , widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world 's pre-eminent dramatist . ; ; . He is often called England 's national poet , and the `` Bard of Avon '' . His extant works , including collaborations , consist of approximately 38 plays , 154 sonnets , two long narrative poems , and a few other verses , some of uncertain authorship . His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright .   Shakespeare was born and brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon , Warwickshire . At the age of 18 , he married Anne Hathaway , with whom he had three children : Susanna , and twins Hamnet and Judith . Sometime between 1585 and 1592 , he began a successful career in London as an actor , writer , and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , later known as the King 's Men . He appears to have retired to Stratford around 1613 , at age 49 , where he died three years later . Few records of Shakespeare 's private life survive , which has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance , sexuality , and religious beliefs , and whether the works attributed to him were written by others .   Shakespeare produced most of his known work between 1589 and 1613 . His early plays were primarily comedies and histories , and these are regarded as some of the best work ever produced in these genres . He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608 , including Hamlet , Othello , King Lear , and Macbeth , considered some of the finest works in the English language . In his last phase , he wrote tragicomedies , also known as romances , and collaborated with other playwrights .   Many of his plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime . In 1623 , however , John Heminges and Henry Condell , two friends and fellow actors of Shakespeare , published a more definitive text known as the First Folio , a posthumous collected edition of his dramatic works that included all but two of the plays now recognised as Shakespeare 's . It was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson , in which Shakespeare is hailed , presciently , as `` not of an age , but for all time '' .The Norton Anthology of English Literature : Sixteenth/Early Seventeenth Century , Volume B , 2012 , pg . 1168   In the 20th and 21st centuries , his works have been repeatedly adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance . His plays remain highly popular , and are constantly studied , performed , and reinterpreted in diverse cultural and political contexts throughout the world .   Life   Early life   William Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare , an alderman and a successful glover originally from Snitterfield , and Mary Arden , the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer . He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564 . His actual date of birth remains unknown , but is traditionally observed on 23 April , Saint George 's Day . This date , which can be traced back to an 18th-century scholar 's mistake , has proved appealing to biographers , because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 . He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son .   Although no attendance records for the period survive , most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King 's New School in Stratford , a free school chartered in 1553 , about a quarter-mile ( 400 m ) from his home . Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era , but grammar school curricula were largely similar : the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree , and the school would have provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors .   At the age of 18 , Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway . The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582 . The next day , two of Hathaway 's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage . The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste , since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of"], [480, "Harold Edward Holt , ( ; 5 August 1908 - 17 December 1967 ) , was an Australian politician and the 17th Prime Minister of Australia . He was born in Stanmore , New South Wales and won a scholarship to study law at the University of Melbourne . Holt went into business as a solicitor , during which time he joined the United Australia Party ( UAP ) . In 1935 , aged just 27 , he was elected for Fawkner . Holt spent 32 years in Parliament , including many years as a senior Cabinet Minister , but was Prime Minister for only 22 months before he disappeared in December 1967 while swimming at Cheviot Beach near Portsea , Victoria , and was presumed drowned .   As Minister for Immigration ( 1949–1956 ) , Holt was responsible for the relaxation of the White Australia policy and as Treasurer under Menzies , he initiated major fiscal reforms including the establishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia , and launched and guided the process to convert Australia to decimal currency . As Prime Minister , he oversaw landmark changes including the decision not to devalue the Australian dollar in line with the British pound , and the 1967 constitutional referendum in which an overwhelming majority of Australians voted in favour of giving the Commonwealth power to legislate specifically for indigenous Australians . He controversially expanded Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War , with the slogan `` All the way with LBJ '' .   Early life   Born in Stanmore , New South Wales on 5 August 1908 , Holt was the elder son of Thomas and Olive ( née Williams ) . He and his brother Cliff ( Clifford Thomas Holt , born 1910 ) , spent their early life in Sydney , attending three different schools . In 1918 , Thomas Holt divorced Olive and went to work with the Hugh D. McIntosh , manager of the Tivoli theatre circuit . He later became the Tivoli-J C Williamson representative in London and New York . Meanwhile , he enrolled his sons as boarders at Wesley College in Melbourne .   In 1924 , when Holt was sixteen , his mother died and he did not attend her funeral . A formative event was his singing performance at his school 's annual Speech Night in December 1926 . None of his family were present , and he never forgot the loneliness he felt that night .   Holt won a scholarship to Queen 's College at the University of Melbourne and began his law degree in 1927 . He excelled in many areas of university life – he won College 'Blues ' for cricket and Australian rules football , as well as the College Oratory and Essay Prize . A member of the Melbourne Inter-University Debating team and the United Australia Organization ' A ' Grade debating team , he was president of both the Sports and Social Club and the Law Students ' Society .   Holt graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1930 . He was admitted to the Victorian Bar in November 1932 and served his articles with the Melbourne firm of Fink , Best & Miller , but the Great Depression meant that he was unable to find work as a barrister . His father , based in London at the time , wanted him to further his studies in England , but the worsening economy also made this impossible . Instead , in 1933 , Holt went into sole practice as a solicitor . He later entered into a partnership , which became the firm of Holt , Graham & Newman , which Holt remained with until 1963 .   While at university , Holt had met Zara Kate Dickins . In 1934 they were contemplating marriage , but , after a quarrel , they split up . Zara travelled overseas , meeting Captain James Fell , a British Army officer stationed in India , whom she married in March 1935 . Her first son Nicholas was born in 1937 , followed by twin boys Sam and Andrew , born in 1939 . Author Tom Frame has suggested that Holt was the father of the twins . Zara and Fell subsequently divorced , and she married Holt in 1946 . Although they remained married until Holt 's death in 1967 , Zara later commented that Holt had had a number of extramarital affairs .   Meanwhile , Thomas Holt married Lola Thring , the daughter of his business partner F. W. Thring , in 1936 . He died in 1945 .

The collection 's original title was The Federalist ; the title The Federalist Papers did not emerge until the 20th century .   Though the authors of The Federalist Papers foremost wished to influence the vote in favor of ratifying the Constitution , in Federalist No . 1 they explicitly set that debate in broader political terms :  It has been frequently remarked , that it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country , by their conduct and example , to decide the important question , whether societies of men are really capable or not , of establishing good government from reflection and choice , or whether they are forever destined to depend , for their political constitutions , on accident and force .   Highlights abound in the essays of The Federalist . Federalist No . 10 , in which Madison discusses the means of preventing rule by majority faction and advocates a large , commercial republic , is generally regarded as the most important of the 85 articles from a philosophical perspective ; it is complemented by Federalist No . 14 , in which Madison takes the measure of the United States , declares it appropriate for an extended republic , and concludes with a memorable defense of the constitutional and political creativity of the Federal Convention . In Federalist No . 84 , Hamilton makes the case that there is no need to amend the Constitution by adding a Bill of Rights , insisting that the various provisions in the proposed Constitution protecting liberty amount to a `` bill of rights '' . Federalist No . 78 , also written by Hamilton , lays the groundwork for the doctrine of judicial review by federal courts of federal legislation or executive acts . Federalist No . 70 presents Hamilton 's case for a one-man chief executive . In Federalist No . 39 , Madison presents the clearest exposition of what has come to be called `` Federalism '' . In Federalist No . 51 , Madison distills arguments for checks and balances in an essay often quoted for its justification of government as `` the greatest of all reflections on human nature . ''   According to historian Richard B. Morris , they are an `` incomparable exposition of the Constitution , a classic in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any later American writer . ''   History   Origins   The Federal Convention sent the proposed Constitution to the Confederation Congress , which in turn submitted it to the states for ratification at the end of September 1787 . On September 27 , 1787 , `` Cato '' first appeared in the New York press criticising the proposition ; `` Brutus '' followed on October 18 , 1787 . These and other articles and public letters critical of the new Constitution would eventually become known as the `` Anti-Federalist Papers '' . In response , Hamilton decided to launch a measured defense and extensive explanation of the proposed Constitution to the people of the state of New York . He wrote in Federalist No . 1 that the series would `` endeavor to give a satisfactory answer to all the objections which shall have made their appearance , that may seem to have any claim to your attention . ''   Hamilton recruited collaborators for the project . He enlisted John Jay , who after four strong essays ( Federalist Nos . 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) , fell ill and contributed only one more essay , Federalist No . 64 , to the series . He also distilled his case into a pamphlet in the spring of 1788 , [ http : //www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/exhibitions/constitution/address/address.html An Address to the People of the State of New-York ] ; Hamilton cited it approvingly in Federalist No . 85 . James Madison , present in New York as a Virginia delegate to the Confederation Congress , was recruited by Hamilton and Jay , and became Hamilton 's major collaborator . Gouverneur Morris and William Duer were also apparently considered ; Morris turned down"], [482, "BBC Radio 1 is a British radio station operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation which also broadcasts internationally , specialising in modern and current popular music and chart hits throughout the day . Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7:00 pm , including electronic dance , hip hop , rock , indie or interviews . It is aimed primarily at the 15–29 age group , although the average age of the UK audience in 2008 was 33 . BBC Radio 1 started 24-hour broadcasting on 1 May 1991 .   History   First broadcast   Radio 1 was established in 1967 ( along with the more middle of the road BBC Radio 2 ) as a successor to the BBC Light Programme , which had broadcast popular music and other entertainment since 1945 . Radio 1 was conceived as a direct response to the popularity of offshore pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline and Radio London , which had been outlawed by Act of Parliament . Radio 1 was launched at 7:00 am on Saturday 30 September 1967 .   The first disc jockey to broadcast on the new station was Tony Blackburn , whose cheery style , first heard on Radio Caroline and Radio London , won him the prime slot on what became known as the `` Radio 1 Breakfast Show '' . The first words on Radio 1 – after a countdown by the Controller of Radios 1 and 2 , Robin Scott , and a jingle , recorded at PAMS in Dallas , Texas , beginning `` The voice of Radio 1 '' – were `` ... And , good morning everyone . Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio 1 '' . This was the first use of US-style jingles on BBC radio , but the style was familiar to listeners who were acquainted with Blackburn and other DJs from their days on pirate radio . The first complete record played on Radio 1 was `` Flowers in the Rain '' by The Move . The second single was `` Massachusetts '' by The Bee Gees . The breakfast show remains the most prized slot in the Radio 1 schedule , with every change of breakfast show presenter exciting considerable media interest .  The initial rota of staff included John Peel and a gaggle of others , some hired from pirates , such as Keith Skues , Ed Stewart , Mike Raven , David Ryder , Jim Fisher , Jimmy Young , Dave Cash , Kenny Everett , Simon Dee , Terry Wogan , Duncan Johnson , Doug Crawford , Tommy Vance , Chris Denning , Emperor Rosko , Pete Murray , and Bob Holness . Many of the most popular pirate radio voices , such as Simon Dee , had only a one-hour slot per week , ( `` Midday Spin . '' ) Annie Nightingale , who joined in 1970 , was Britain 's first female DJ and is now the longest serving presenter , having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times .   1970s peak   Initially , the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who , it is claimed , disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with Radio 2 and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations , with some DJs such as Jimmy Young being in their 40s . The very fact that it was part of an `` establishment '' institution such as the BBC was a turn-off for some , and needle time restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had . It also had limited finances ( partially because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station ) and often , as in January 1975 , suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks , strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives .   Despite this , it gained massive audiences , becoming the most listened to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows ( up to 20 million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows ) . In the early-mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids , thanks to the Publicity Department 's high profile work . The popularity of Radio 1 's touring summer live broadcasts the Radio 1 Roadshow - usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks ' promotions that took Radio 1 , 2 and 4 shows on the road - drew some of the largest crowds of the decade"], [483, "Charles John Huffam Dickens ( ; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870 ) was an English writer and social critic . He created some of the world 's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era .. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime , and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius . His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity .   Born in Portsmouth , Dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors ' prison . Despite his lack of formal education , he edited a weekly journal for 20 years , wrote 15 novels , five novellas , hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles , lectured and performed extensively , was an indefatigable letter writer , and campaigned vigorously for children 's rights , education , and other social reforms .   Dickens 's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers . Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity , famous for his humour , satire , and keen observation of character and society . His novels , most published in monthly or weekly instalments , pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction , which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication . The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience 's reaction , and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback . For example , when his wife 's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities , Dickens improved the character with positive features . His plots were carefully constructed , and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives . Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them , opening up and inspiring a new class of readers .   Dickens was regarded as the literary colossus of his age . His 1843 novella , A Christmas Carol , remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre . Oliver Twist and Great Expectations are also frequently adapted , and , like many of his novels , evoke images of early Victorian London . His 1859 novel , A Tale of Two Cities , set in London and Paris , is his best-known work of historical fiction . Dickens 's creative genius has been praised by fellow writers—from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell and G. K. Chesterton—for its realism , comedy , prose style , unique characterisations , and social criticism . On the other hand , Oscar Wilde , Henry James , and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth , loose writing , and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism . The term Dickensian is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings , such as poor social conditions or comically repulsive characters .   Early years   Charles John Huffam Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 , at 1 Mile End Terrace ( now 393 Commercial Road ) , Landport in Portsea Island ( Portsmouth ) , the second of eight children of John Dickens ( 1785–1851 ) and Elizabeth Dickens ( née Barrow ; 1789–1863 ) . His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district . He asked Christopher Huffam , rigger to His Majesty 's Navy , gentleman , and head of an established firm , to act as godfather to Charles . Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey , the owner of a shipping company in Dickens 's eponymous Dombey and Son ( 1848 ) .   In January 1815 John Dickens was called back to London , and the family moved to Norfolk Street , Fitzrovia . When Charles was four , they relocated to Sheerness , and thence to Chatham , Kent , where he spent his formative years until the age of 11 . His early life seems to have been idyllic , though he thought himself a `` very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy '' .   Charles spent time outdoors but also read voraciously , including the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding , as well as Robinson Crusoe and Gil Blas . He read and reread The Arabian Nights and the Collected Farces of Elizabeth Inchbald . He retained poignant memories of childhood , helped by an excellent memory of people and events , which he used in his writing .

Located at the crossroads of Western Asia and Eastern Europe , it is bounded to the west by the Black Sea , to the north by Russia , to the south by Turkey and Armenia , and to the southeast by Azerbaijan . The capital and largest city is Tbilisi . Georgia covers a territory of 69700 km² , and its 2015 population is about 3.75 million . Georgia is a unitary , semi-presidential republic , with the government elected through a representative democracy .   During the classical era , several independent kingdoms became established in what is now Georgia . The kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia adopted Christianity in the early 4th century . A unified Kingdom of Georgia reached the peak of its political and economic strength during the reign of King David IV and Queen Tamar in the 11th–12th centuries . Thereafter the area was dominated by various large empires for centuries , including the Mongols , the Ottoman Empire , and successive dynasties of Iran . In the late 18th century , the kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti forged an alliance with the Russian Empire , and the area was annexed by Russia in 1801 . The latter 's rule over Georgia was confirmed in 1813 through the Treaty of Gulistan with Qajar Iran . Following the Russian Revolution in 1917 , Georgia obtained independence , though only briefly , and established its first-ever republic under German and British protection , only to be invaded by Soviet Russia in 1921 and subsequently absorbed into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic .   After restoring its independence once again in 1991 , post-communist Georgia suffered from civil and economic crisis for most of the 1990s . This lasted until the peaceful Rose Revolution , when Georgia pursued a strongly pro-Western foreign policy , introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at NATO and European integration . The country 's Western orientation soon led to the worsening of relations with Russia , culminating in the brief Russo-Georgian War .   Georgia is a member of the Council of Europe and the GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development . It contains two de facto independent regions , Abkhazia and South Ossetia , which gained limited international recognition after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War . Georgia and a major part of the international community consider the regions to be part of Georgia 's sovereign territory under Russian military occupation .   Etymology   `` Georgia '' probably stems from the Persian designation of the Georgians – gurğān , in the 11th and 12th centuries adapted via Syriac gurz-ān/gurz-iyān and Arabic ĵurĵan/ĵurzan . Lore based theories were given by he traveller Jacques de Vitry , who explained the name 's origin by the popularity of St. George amongst Georgians , while traveller Jean Chardin thought that `` Georgia '' came from Greek γεωργός ( `` tiller of the land '' ) . As Prof. Alexander Mikaberidze adds , these century-old explanations for the word Georgia/Georgians are rejected by the scholarly community , who point to the Persian word gurğ/gurğān ( `` wolf '' ) as the root of the word . Starting with the Persian word gurğ/gurğān , the word was later adopted in numerous other languages , including Slavic and West European languages . This term itself might have been established through the ancient Iranian appellation of the near-Caspian region , which was referred to as Gorgan ( `` land of the wolves '' ) .   The native name is Sakartvelo ( საქართველო ; `` land of Kartvelians '' ) , derived from the core central Georgian region of Kartli , recorded from the 9th century , and in extended usage referring to the entire medieval Kingdom of Georgia by the 13th century . The self-designation used by ethnic Georgians is Kartvelebi ( ქართველები , i.e . `` Kartvelians '' )   The medieval Georgian Chronicles present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians , Kartlos , a great-grandson of Japheth . However , scholars agree that the word is derived from the Karts , the latter being one of the proto-Georgian tribes that emerged as a dominant group in ancient times . The name Sakartvelo ( საქართველო ) consists of two parts . Its root , kartvel-i ( ქართველ-ი ) , specifies an inhabitant of the core central-eastern Georgian region of Kartli , or Iberia as it is known in sources of the Eastern Roman Empire . Ancient Greeks ( Strabo , Herodotus , Plutarch , Homer , etc . ) and Romans ( Titus Livius , Tacitus ,"], [485, "Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and , along with the related wasps and bees , belong to the order Hymenoptera . Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period , about 99 million years ago and diversified after the rise of flowering plants . More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified . They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists .   Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals . Larger colonies consist mostly of sterile , wingless females forming castes of `` workers '' , `` soldiers '' , or other specialised groups . Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called `` drones '' and one or more fertile females called `` queens '' . The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity , collectively working together to support the colony .   Ants have colonised almost every landmass on Earth . The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands . Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25 % of the terrestrial animal biomass . Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats , tap resources , and defend themselves . Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic , commensal , parasitic , and mutualistic relationships.Hölldobler & Wilson ( 1990 ) , p. 471   Ant societies have division of labour , communication between individuals , and an ability to solve complex problems . These parallels with human societies have long been an inspiration and subject of study . Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine , medication , and rituals . Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents . Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans , however , as they can damage crops and invade buildings . Some species , such as the red imported fire ant ( Solenopsis invicta ) , are regarded as invasive species , establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally .   Etymology   The word `` ant '' is derived from ' , ' of Middle English which are derived from ' of Old English , and is related to the dialectal Dutch ' and the Old High German ' , hence the modern German ' . All of these words come from West Germanic * , and the original meaning of the word was `` the biter '' ( from Proto-Germanic * , `` off , away '' + * `` cut '' ) . The family name Formicidae is derived from the Latin ' ( `` ant '' ) from which the words in other Romance languages , such as the Portuguese ' , Italian ' , Spanish ' , Romanian ' , and French ' are derived . It has been hypothesised that a Proto-Indo-European word * morwi- was used , cf . Sanskrit vamrah , Latin formīca , Greek μύρμηξ mýrmēx , Old Church Slavonic mraviji , Old Irish moirb , Old Norse maurr , Dutch mier .   Taxonomy and evolution   The family Formicidae belongs to the order Hymenoptera , which also includes sawflies , bees , and wasps . Ants evolved from a lineage within the aculeate wasps , and a 2013 study suggests that they are a sister group of the Apoidea . In 1966 , E. O. Wilson and his colleagues identified the fossil remains of an ant ( Sphecomyrma ) that lived in the Cretaceous period . The specimen , trapped in amber dating back to around 92 million years ago , has features found in some wasps , but not found in modern ants . Sphecomyrma possibly was a ground forager , while Haidomyrmex and Haidomyrmodes , related genera in subfamily Sphecomyrminae , are reconstructed as active arboreal predators . Older ants in the genus Sphecomyrmodes have been found in 99 million year-old amber from Myanmar . After the rise of flowering plants about 100 million years ago they diversified and assumed ecological dominance around 60 million years ago . Some groups , such as the Leptanillinae and Martialinae , are suggested to have diversified from early primitive ants that were likely to have been predators underneath the surface of the soil .   During the Cretaceous period , a few species of primitive ants ranged widely"], [486, "A motorcycle ( also called a motorbike , bike , or cycle ) is a two- > or three-wheeled motor vehicle . Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes : long distance travel , commuting , cruising , sport including racing , and off-road riding . Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies .   In 1894 , Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle , and the first to be called a motorcycle . In 2014 , the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda , Yamaha ( both from Japan ) , and Hero MotoCorp ( India ) .   Motorcycles are usually a luxury good in the developed world , where they are used mostly for recreation , as a lifestyle accessory or a symbol of personal identity . In developing countries , motorcycles are overwhelmingly utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy . Of all the motorcycles in the world , 58 % are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions , excluding car-centric Japan .   According to the United States Department of Transportation the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars .   Types   The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on jurisdiction ( see # Legal definitions and restrictions ) .   There are three major types of motorcycle : street , off-road , and dual purpose . Within these types , there are many sub-types of motorcycles for different purposes . There is often a racing counterpart to each type , such as road racing and street bikes , or motocross and dirt bikes .   Street bikes include cruisers , sportbikes , scooters and mopeds , and many other types . Off-road motorcycles include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not street legal in most areas . Dual purpose machines like the dual-sport style are made to go off-road but include features to make them legal and comfortable on the street as well .   Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability , and each design creates a different riding posture .   History   Experimentation and invention   The first internal combustion , petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen . It was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt , Germany in 1885 . This vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of steering axis angle and no fork offset , and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier . Instead , it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning .   The inventors called their invention the Reitwagen ( `` riding car '' ) . It was designed as an expedient testbed for their new engine , rather than a true prototype vehicle .   The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was a three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle , conceived of Edward Butler in England in 1884 . He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1884 . The vehicle was built by the Merryweather Fire Engine company in Greenwich , in 1888 .   The Butler Petrol Cycle was a three-wheeled vehicle , with the rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp ( 466W ) 600 cc ( 40 in3 ; 2¼×5-inch { 57×127-mm } ) flat twin four stroke engine ( with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery ) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor ( five years before Maybach ) and Ackermann steering , all of which were state of the art at the time . Starting was by compressed air . The engine was liquid-cooled , with a radiator over the rear driving wheel . Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever . No braking system was fitted ; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever ; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels . The driver was seated between the front wheels . It was n't , however , a success , as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing .   Many authorities have excluded steam powered , electric motorcycles or diesel-powered two-wheelers from the definition of a 'motorcycle ' , and credit the Daimler Reitwagen as the world"], [487, "Dombey and Son is a novel by Charles Dickens , published in monthly parts from 1 October 1846 to 1 April 1848 and in one volume in 1848 . Its full title is Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son : Wholesale , Retail and for Exportation . Dickens started writing the book in Lausanne , Switzerland , before returning to England , via Paris , to complete it . Illustrations were provided by Hablot Knight Browne ( 'Phiz ' ) .   There is some concern with the railways and the novel 's conception , and writing , belong to the years of the railway boom , 1844–47 . The sea , meanwhile , becomes the image of things of 'an older fashion yet ' , 'the dark and unknown ... that rolls round all the world . '   Plot summary   The story concerns Paul Dombey , the wealthy owner of the shipping company of the book 's title , whose dream is to have a son to continue his business . The book begins when his son is born , and Dombey 's wife dies shortly after giving birth . Following the advice of Mrs Louisa Chick , his sister , Dombey employs a wet nurse named Mrs Richards ( Toodle ) . Dombey already has a six-year-old daughter Florence but , bitter at her not having been the desired boy , he neglects her continually . One day , Mrs Richards , Florence and her maid , Susan Nipper , secretly pay a visit to Mrs Richard 's house in Staggs 's Gardens so that Mrs Richards can see her children . During this trip , Florence becomes separated from them and is kidnapped for a short time by Good Mrs Brown , before being returned to the streets . She makes her way to Dombey and Son 's offices in the City and there is found and brought home by Walter Gay , an employee of Mr Dombey , who first introduces her to his uncle , the navigation instrument maker Solomon Gills , at his shop the Wooden Midshipman .   The child , named Paul after his father , is a weak and sickly child , who does not socialise normally with others ; adults call him `` old fashioned '' . He is intensely fond of his sister Florence , who is deliberately neglected by her father as irrelevant and a distraction . He is sent to the seaside at Brighton for his health , where he and Florence lodge with the ancient and acidic Mrs Pipchin . Finding his health beginning to improve there , Mr Dombey keeps him at Brighton and has him educated there at Dr and Mrs Blimber 's school , where he and the other boys undergo both an intense and arduous education under the tutelage of Mr Feeder , B.A . and Cornelia Blimber . It is here that Paul is befriended by a fellow pupil , the amiable but weak-minded Mr Toots .   Here , Paul 's health declines even further in this 'great hothouse ' and he finally dies , still only six years old . Dombey pushes his daughter away from him after the death of his son , while she futilely tries to earn his love . In the meantime , young Walter sent off to fill a junior position in the firm 's counting house at Barbados through the manipulations of Mr Dombey 's confidential manager , Mr James Carker , 'with his white teeth ' , who sees him as a potential rival , through his association with Florence . His boat is reported lost and he is presumed drowned . Walter 's uncle leaves to go in search of Walter , leaving his great friend Captain Edward Cuttle in charge of the Midshipman . Meanwhile , Florence is now left alone with few friends to keep her company .   Dombey goes to Leamington Spa with a new friend , Major Joseph B. Bagstock . The Major deliberately sets out to befriend Dombey to spite his neighbour in Princess 's Place , Miss Tox , who has turned cold towards him owing to her hopes – through her close friendship with Mrs Chick – of marrying Mr Dombey . At the spa , Dombey is introduced via the Major to Mrs Skewton and her widowed daughter , Mrs Edith Granger . Mr Dombey , on the lookout for a new wife since his son 's death , considers Edith a suitable match due to her accomplishments and family connections ; he is encouraged by both the Major and the avaricious mother , but obviously feels no affection for her ."], [488, "Madeira Airport ( ) , informally Funchal Airport ( ) , is an international airport in the municipality/civil parish of Santa Cruz , in the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira . The airport is located east-northeast of the regional capital Funchal after which it is sometimes informally named . On 2016 , it was announced that the airport will be renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo Airport ( ) in honour of Madeira native football player Cristiano Ronaldo .   The airport was once infamous for its short runway which , surrounded by high mountains and the ocean , made it a tricky landing for even the most experienced of pilots . Its innovative solution allowed Funchal to receive the Outstanding Structure Award in 2004 by the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering , which aims at recognizing the most remarkable , innovative , creative or otherwise stimulating structure completed within the last few years . Nevertheless , it is still considered one of the most peculiarly perilous airports in the world .   History   Madeira Airport was officially opened on 18 July 1964 , with two 1600 m runways . The first flight ever to land was a TAP Air Portugal Lockheed Constellation with 80 passengers on board .   In 1972 , the popularity of visiting the island of Madeira increased , so the runway had to be extended to allow modern and larger aircraft to land . Considered the Kai Tak of Europe because of its singular approach to runway 05 , the decision was made to extend the existing runway , instead of building a new one . In the meantime , a brand new terminal was built at the airport in 1973 , handling 500,000 passengers .   Between 1982 and 1986 , Madeira 's runway was successfully extended by 200 m to a total of 1800 m , and also four gates were opened . The original runway was only 1600 m long , but was extended by 200 m 8 years after the TAP Portugal Flight 425 crash of 1977 .   In 2000 , the runway was again extended this time to 2781 m almost doubling the size of the original runway . As landfill was not a realistic option , the extension was built on a platform , partly over the ocean , supported by 180 columns , each about 70 m tall . The extension of Madeira Airport was conducted by the Brazilian construction company Andrade Gutierrez , and is recognized worldwide as one of the most difficult to achieve due to the type of terrain and orography .   The new runway and terminal were inaugurated on 6 October 2002 , and to mark the occasion , an Air-Atlantic Iceland Boeing 747-267B , registration TF-ABA , landed at the airport . Although this was a rare event , some TAP Portugal flights make scheduled stops at Madeira with wide bodied A330-200 aircraft on the Lisbon-Caracas-Lisbon route .   In 2004 , Dr. Manabu Ito , President of the International Association of Bridge and Structural Engineering ( IABSE ) , presented the IABSE Outstanding Structure Award in Shanghai : the enlargement of the new runway at Funchal Airport won the 2004 Outstanding Structure Award ( considered the Oscars of worldwide structural engineering ) by the IABSE .   The History Channel program Most Extreme Airports ranked it as the 9th most dangerous airport in the world , and the third most dangerous in Europe after Gibraltar International Airport and Courchevel Altiport .   On 23 July 2016 , it was announced that the airport will be renamed after famous footballer , Cristiano Ronaldo .   Terminal   The airport has a single terminal which opened in 1973 . The terminal has 40 check-in desks , 16 boarding gates and 7 baggage belts . There are no air-bridges so passengers either walk the short distance to the terminal or are taken by shuttle bus . The terminal itself is mostly underground .   Airlines and destinations   Busiest routes   Accidents and incidents   * On 5 March 1973 , an Aviaco Sud Caravelle 10R ( Registration EC-BID ) crashed into the sea during the landing approach , losing the aircraft and three crew .   * On 19 November 1977 , TAP Portugal Flight TP425 , a Boeing 727-200 ( Registration CS-TBR ) was traveling from Brussels to Madeira via Lisbon . After a go-around , the aircraft attempted to land in poor weather conditions . It landed long on runway 24 ( now runway 23 ) and plunged over a steep bank . It then struck a stone bridge and the right wing"], [489, 'Roman historiography is indebted to the Greeks , who invented the form . The Romans had great models to base their works upon , such as Herodotus ( c. 484 – 425 BCE ) and Thucydides ( c. 460 – c. 395 BCE ) . Roman historiographical forms are different from the Greek ones however , and voice very Roman concerns . Unlike the Greeks , Roman historiography did not start out with an oral historical tradition . The Roman style of history was based on the way that the Annals of the Pontifex Maximus , or the Annales Maximi , were recorded . The Annales Maximi include a wide array of information , including religious documents , names of consuls , deaths of priests , and various disasters throughout history . Also part of the Annales Maximi are the White Tablets , or the “ Tabulae Albatae , ” which consist of information on the origin of the republic .   History of Roman historiography   The foundation of Roman historiography   The most well-known originator of Roman historiography was Quintus Fabius Pictor , also known as the “ Founder of Historiography ” . Before the second Punic war , there was no historiography in Rome , but after , it was needed to commemorate this important occasion . Q. Fabius Pictor took up the task and wrote a history of Rome in Greek , not Latin . This choice of writing about the war in Greek arose from a need to address the Greeks and counter another author , Timaeus , who also wrote a history of Rome until the Second Punic War . Timaeus wrote with a negative view of Rome . Therefore , in defense of the Roman state , Q. Fabius Pictor wrote in Greek , using Olympiad dating and a Hellenistic style . Q. Fabius Pictor ’ s style of writing history defending the Roman state and its actions , and using propaganda heavily , eventually became a defining characteristic of Roman historiography .   Q. Fabius Pictor is known for the establishment of the “ ab urbe condita ” tradition of historiography which is writing history “ from the founding of the city. ” After Q. Fabius Pictor wrote , many other authors followed his lead , inspired by the new literary form : Lucius Cincius Alimentus , Gaius Acilius , Aulus Postumius Albinus , and Cato the Elder . Cato the Elder is credited as the first historian to write in Latin . His work , the Origines , was written to teach Romans what it means to be Roman . Like Q. Fabius Pictor , Cato the Elder wrote ab urbe condita , and the early history is filled with legends illustrating Roman virtues . The Origines also spoke of how not only Rome , but the other Italian towns were venerable , and that the Romans were indeed superior to the Greeks .   The Romans enjoyed serious endeavors and so the writing of historiography became very popular for upper class citizens who wanted to spend their time on worthwhile , virtuous , “ Roman ” activities . As leisure time was looked down upon by the Romans , writing history became an acceptable way to spend retirement .   Almost as soon as historiography started being used by the Romans , it split into two traditions : the annalistic tradition and the monographic tradition .   The annalistic tradition   The authors who used the Annalistic tradition wrote histories year-by-year , from the beginning , which was most frequently from the founding of the city , usually up until the time that they were living in .   Some annalistic authors :  * Gnaeus Gellius ( c. 140 BC ) wrote his history from Aeneas until 146 BC .  * Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi ( c. 133 BC ) wrote trying to figure out why the Roman society had begun to decline . His history chronicled Rome from the foundation until 154 BC , when he believed that the society had hit its lowest point .  * Publius Mucius Scaevola ( c. 133 BC ) wrote a history from the foundation of the city in 80 books .  * Sempronius Asellio ( c. 100 BC ) wrote a history from the Punic Wars until c. 100 BC .  * Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius wrote that all Roman wars are just , and that the Senate and all Roman dealings were honorable , in annalistic form .   The monographic tradition   Monographs are more similar to the history books that we are used to today ; they are usually on a single topic ,'], [490, "Alexander III of Macedon ( 20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC ) , commonly known as Alexander the Great ( , Aléxandros ho Mégas ) , was a King ( Basileus ) of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty . Born in Pella in 356 BC , Alexander succeeded his father , Philip II , to the throne at the age of twenty . He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa , and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world , stretching from Greece to northwestern India . He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history 's most successful military commanders .   During his youth , Alexander was tutored by the philosopher Aristotle until the age of 16 . After Philip 's assassination in 336 BC , Alexander succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army . Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father 's Panhellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia . In 334 BC , he invaded the Achaemenid Empire , ruled Asia Minor , and began a series of campaigns that lasted ten years . Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles , most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela . He subsequently overthrew the Persian King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety . At that point , his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River .   Seeking to reach the `` ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea '' , he invaded India in 326 BC , but was eventually forced to turn back at the demand of his troops . Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BC , the city he planned to establish as his capital , without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia . In the years following his death , a series of civil wars tore his empire apart , resulting in several states ruled by the Diadochi , Alexander 's surviving generals and heirs .   Alexander 's legacy includes the cultural diffusion his conquests engendered , such as Greco-Buddhism . He founded some twenty cities that bore his name , most notably Alexandria in Egypt . Alexander 's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization , aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s . Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of Achilles , and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures . He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves , and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics . He is often ranked among the most influential people in human history , along with his teacher Aristotle .   Early life   Lineage and childhood   Alexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion , which probably corresponds to 20July 356 BC , although the exact date is not known , in Pella , the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon . He was the son of the king of Macedon , Philip II , and his fourth wife , Olympias , the daughter of Neoptolemus I , king of Epirus . Although Philip had seven or eight wives , Olympias was his principal wife for some time , likely a result of giving birth to Alexander .   Several legends surround Alexander 's birth and childhood . According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch , Olympias , on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip , dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunder bolt , causing a flame that spread `` far and wide '' before dying away . Some time after the wedding , Philip is said to have seen himself , in a dream , securing his wife 's womb with a seal engraved with a lion 's image . Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams : that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage , indicated by the sealing of her womb ; or that Alexander 's father was Zeus . Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the"], [491, "Apollo ( Attic , Ionic , and Homeric Greek : , Apollōn ( ) ; Doric : , Apellōn ; Arcadocypriot : , Apeilōn ; Aeolic : , Aploun ; ) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology . The ideal of the kouros ( a beardless , athletic youth ) , Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music , truth and prophecy , healing , the sun and light , plague , poetry , and more . Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto , and has a twin sister , the chaste huntress Artemis . Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu .   As the patron of Delphi ( Pythian Apollo ) , Apollo was an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle . Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo , whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius , yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague . Amongst the god 's custodial charges , Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists , and as the patron defender of herds and flocks . As the leader of the Muses ( Apollon Musegetes ) and director of their choir , Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry . Hermes created the lyre for him , and the instrument became a common attribute of Apollo . Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans .   In Hellenistic times , especially during the 3rd century BCE , as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios , Titan god of the sun , and his sister Artemis similarly equated with Selene , Titan goddess of the moon . In Latin texts , on the other hand , Joseph Fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with Sol among the Augustan poets of the 1st century , not even in the conjurations of Aeneas and Latinus in Aeneid XII ( 161–215 ) . Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE .   Etymology   The name of Apollo itself—though not Paean , a possible name of a precursor god to or epithet of him—is generally considered to be absent from the Linear B ( Mycenean Greek ) texts although it is possible that the name is in fact attested in the lacunose form ] pe-rjo- [ ( Linear B : ] - [ ) on the KN E 842 tablet .   The etymology of the name is uncertain . The spelling ( in Classical Attic ) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era , but the Doric form Apellon ( ) , is more archaic , derived from an earlier . It probably is a cognate to the Doric month Apellaios ( ) , and the offerings apellaia ( ) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai ( ) .  According to some scholars the words are derived from the Doric word apella ( ) , which originally meant `` wall , '' `` fence for animals '' and later `` assembly within the limits of the square . `` The word usually appears in plural : Hesychius : ( apellai ) , ( `` folds '' ) , ( `` assemblies '' ) , ( `` elections '' ) : Nilsson , Vol . I , p. 556 Apella ( ) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta , corresponding to the ecclesia ( ) . R. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form * Apalyun .   Several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors . Thus , the Greeks most often associated Apollo 's name with the Greek verb ( apollymi ) , `` to destroy '' . Plato in Cratylus connects the name with ( apolysis ) , `` redemption '' , with ( apolousis ) , `` purification '' , and with ( [ h ] aploun ) , `` simple '' , in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name , , and finally with ( aeiballon ) , `` ever-shooting '' . Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric ( apella ) , which means `` assembly '' , so that Apollo would be the god of political life , and he also gives the explanation ( sekos ) , `` fold '' , in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds"], [492, "The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed inland body of water on Earth by area , variously classed as the world 's largest lake or a full-fledged sea . It is in an endorheic basin ( it has no outflows ) located between Europe and Asia . It is bounded to the northeast by Kazakhstan , to the northwest by Russia , to the west by Azerbaijan , to the south by Iran , and to the southeast by Turkmenistan .   The Caspian Sea lies to the east of the Caucasus Mountains and to the west of the vast steppe of Central Asia . Its northern part , the Caspian Depression , is one of the lowest points on Earth . The ancient inhabitants of its coast perceived the Caspian Sea as an ocean , probably because of its saltiness and large size .   The sea has a surface area of ( not including its detached lagoon of Garabogazköl Aylagy ) and a volume of . It has a salinity of approximately 1.2 % ( 12 g/l ) , about a third of the salinity of most seawater .   Etymology   The word Caspian is derived from the name of the Caspi , an ancient people who lived to the southwest of the sea in Transcaucasia . Strabo wrote that `` to the country of the Albanians belongs also the territory called Caspiane , which was named after the Caspian tribe , as was also the sea ; but the tribe has now disappeared '' . Moreover , the Caspian Gates , which is the name of a region in Iran 's Tehran province , possibly indicates that they migrated to the south of the sea . The Iranian city of Qazvin shares the root of its name with that of the sea . In fact , the traditional Arabic name for the sea itself is Bahr al-Qazwin ( Sea of Qazvin ) .   In classical antiquity among Greeks and Persians it was called the Hyrcanian Ocean . In Persian antiquity , as well as in modern Iran , it is known as the , Daryā-e Khazar ; it is also sometimes referred to as Mazandaran Sea ( ) in Iran . Ancient Arabic sources refer to it as Baḥr Gīlān ( بحر گیلان ) meaning `` the Gilan Sea '' .   Turkic languages refer to the lake as Khazar Sea . In Turkmen , the name is , in Azeri , it is , and in modern Turkish , it is . In all these cases , the second word simply means `` sea '' , and the first word refers to the historical Khazars who had a large empire based to the north of the Caspian Sea between the 7th and 10th centuries . An exception is Kazakh , where it is called , Kaspiy teñizi ( Caspian Sea ) .   Old Russian sources call it the Khvalyn or Khvalis Sea ( Хвалынское море / Хвалисское море ) after the name of Khwarezmia . In modern Russian , it is called , Kaspiyskoye more .   Physical characteristics   Formation   The Caspian Sea , like the Aral Sea , Black Sea , and Lake Urmia , is a remnant of the ancient Paratethys Sea . It became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago due to tectonic uplift and a fall in sea level . During warm and dry climatic periods , the landlocked sea almost dried up , depositing evaporitic sediments like halite that were covered by wind-blown deposits and were sealed off as an evaporite sink when cool , wet climates refilled the basin . ( Comparable evaporite beds underlie the Mediterranean . ) Due to the current inflow of fresh water , the Caspian Sea is a freshwater lake in its northern portions . It is more saline on the Iranian shore , where the catchment basin contributes little flow . Currently , the mean salinity of the Caspian is one third that of Earth 's oceans . The Garabogazköl embayment , which dried up when water flow from the main body of the Caspian was blocked in the 1980s but has since been restored , routinely exceeds oceanic salinity by a factor of 10 .   Geography   The Caspian Sea is the largest inland body of water in the world and accounts for 40 to 44 % of the total lacustrine waters of the world . The coastlines of the Caspian are shared by Azerbaijan , Iran , Kazakhstan , Russia , and Turkmenistan . The Caspian is divided into three distinct physical regions : the Northern , Middle , and Southern Caspian .

It is known as the home of Irish Jumps Racing and plays host to the annual Punchestown Irish National Hunt Festival . The racecourse itself is right handed with an undulating hurdle and steeplechase track . The hurdle course is one mile six furlongs in distance while the chase course is 2 miles . Punchestown Racecourse also has the only cross country banks course in Ireland .   As well as horse racing , Punchestown hosts several music events , including the annual Oxegen festival , while AC/DC , Bon Jovi and Eminem are among the artists to have played sold out concerts on the racecourse . In 1982 U2 played to over 16,000 people supported by Phil Lynott , Rory Gallagher and Simple Minds . this was part of Hot Press fifth Anniversary .   Dick O'Sullivan has been General Manager since 2003 .   Punchestown Festival   The Punchestown Festival is the major horse racing festival of the Irish National Hunt Season and is usually held annually in April . The Punchestown Festival is held over five days , between Tuesday and Saturday inclusive . It is seen by many as the Irish version of the Cheltenham Festival and is run in a very similar format .   The major races at the Festival are the Champion Chase , Ryanair Novice Chase , Champion Hurdle , World Series Hurdle , Herald Champion Novice Hurdle , Tattersalls Ireland Champion Novice Hurdle , Growise Champion Novice Chase , Champion Four Year Old Hurdle , Champion INH Flat Race and the Punchestown Gold Cup .

It is also called Japanese horseradish , although horseradish is a different plant ( which is generally used as a substitute for wasabi , due to the scarcity of the wasabi plant ) . Its stem is used as a condiment and has an extremely strong pungency more akin to hot mustard than the capsaicin in a chili pepper , producing vapours that stimulate the nasal passages more than the tongue . The plant grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan . The two main cultivars in the marketplace are E. japonicum 'Daruma ' and 'Mazuma ' , but there are many others .  The origin of wasabi cuisine has been clarified from the oldest historical records ; it takes its rise in Nara prefecture .   Uses   Wasabi is generally sold either as a stem , which must be very finely grated before use , as dried powder in large quantities , or as a ready-to-use paste in tubes similar to travel toothpaste tubes . Because it grows mostly submerged , it is a common misconception to refer to the part used for wasabi as a root or sometimes even a rhizome : it is in fact the stem of the plant , with the characteristic leaf scar where old leaves fell off or were collected .   In some high-end restaurants , the paste is prepared when the customer orders , and is made using a grater to grate the stem ; once the paste is prepared , it loses flavour in 15 minutes if left uncovered . In sushi preparation , sushi chefs usually put the wasabi between the fish and the rice because covering wasabi until served preserves its flavor .   Fresh wasabi leaves can be eaten , having the spicy flavor of wasabi stems .   Legumes ( peanuts , soybeans , or peas ) may be roasted or fried , then coated with wasabi powder mixed with sugar , salt , or oil and eaten as a crunchy snack .   Surrogates   Wasabi is difficult to cultivate , and that makes it quite expensive . Outside Japan , it is rare to find real wasabi plants . Due to its high cost , a common substitute is a mixture of horseradish , mustard , starch and green food coloring or spinach powder . Often packages are labeled as wasabi while the ingredients do not actually include wasabi plant . Wasabi and horseradish are similar in taste and pungency due to similar isothiocyanate levels . The primary difference between the two is color with Wasabi being naturally green . In Japan , horseradish is referred to as . In the United States , true wasabi is generally found only at specialty grocers and high-end restaurants .   Chemistry   The chemical in wasabi that provides for its initial pungency is the volatile allyl isothiocyanate , which is produced by hydrolysis of natural thioglucosides ( conjugates of the sugar glucose , and sulfur-containing organic compounds ) ; the hydrolysis reaction is catalyzed by myrosinase and occurs when the enzyme is released on cell rupture caused by maceration – e.g. , grating – of the plant . The same compound is responsible for the pungency of horseradish and mustard .   The unique flavor of wasabi is a result of complex chemical mixtures from the broken cells of the plant , including those resulting from the hydrolysis of thioglucosides into glucose and methylthioalkyl isothiocyanates :   * 6-methylthiohexyl isothiocyanate  * 7-methylthioheptyl isothiocyanate  * 8-methylthiooctyl isothiocyanate   Research has shown that such isothiocyanates inhibit microbe growth , perhaps with implications for preserving food against spoilage and suppressing oral bacterial growth .   Because the burning sensations of wasabi are not oil-based , they are short-lived compared to the effects of chili peppers , and are washed away with more food or liquid . The sensation is felt primarily in the nasal passage and can be quite painful depending on the amount consumed . Inhaling or sniffing wasabi vapor has an effect like smelling salts , a property exploited by researchers attempting to create a smoke alarm for the deaf . One deaf subject participating in a test of the prototype awoke within 10 seconds of wasabi vapor sprayed into his sleeping chamber . The 2011 Ig Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the researchers for determining the ideal density of airborne wasabi to wake people in the event of an emergency .

Nabokov 's own translation of the book into Russian was published by Phaedra Publishers in New York in 1967 . The novel is notable for its controversial subject : the protagonist and unreliable narrator , a middle-aged literature professor called Humbert Humbert , is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze , with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather . `` Lolita '' is his private nickname for Dolores .   Lolita quickly attained a classic status ; it is today regarded as one of the prime achievements in 20th century literature , though also among the most controversial . The novel was adapted into a film by Stanley Kubrick in 1962 , and again in 1997 by Adrian Lyne . It has also been adapted several times for the stage and has been the subject of two operas , two ballets , and an acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful Broadway musical . Its assimilation into popular culture is such that the name `` Lolita '' has been used to imply that a young girl is sexually precocious .   Lolita is included on TIME magazine 's list of the 100 best English-language novels published from 1923 to 2005 . It is also fourth on the Modern Library 's 1998 list of the 100 best novels of the 20th century , and holds a place in the Bokklubben World Library , a 2002 collection of the most celebrated books in history .   Plot summary   Humbert Humbert , a European literary scholar , describes the premature death of his childhood sweetheart , Annabel Leigh . He suggests his unconsummated love for her caused his fixation with nymphets ( girls aged 9–14 ) and indulges in his sexual fantasies by pretending to read a book in a public park and being aroused by nymphets playing near him , as well as by visiting a prostitute who he believes is 16 or 17 , and imagining her to be three years younger . After a misadventure when he requests a nymphet-aged girl from a pimp , Humbert marries an adult woman with childish mannerisms , Valeria , to allay suspicion . His marriage with Valeria dissolves , after she admits to having an affair with a Russian taxi driver . Humbert wants to kill her , but Valeria and the taxi driver leave before he gets the chance . After another visit to a psychiatric ward after a mental breakdown , he moves to the small New England town of Ramsdale to write .   Humbert fantasizes about meeting and eventually molesting the 12-year-old daughter of an impoverished family , the McCoos , from whom he agreed to rent an apartment . Upon his arrival in Ramsdale , however , he discovers that their house has burned down . A landlady named Mrs. Charlotte Haze offers to accommodate him instead , and Humbert visits her residence out of politeness . Humbert plans to decline Charlotte 's offer until he sees her 12-year-old daughter , Dolores ( born 1935 ) , known as `` Lo , '' `` Lola , '' or `` Dolly '' . He becomes infatuated with her , in part because of her uncanny resemblance to Annabel , and agrees to stay at Charlotte 's house only to be near her daughter , whom he privately nicknames `` Lolita . ''   Humbert starts a diary in which he keeps detailed descriptions of Lolita 's characteristics , along with moments that they spend together . The diary also contains hateful comments about Charlotte , along with a description of a picture in a magazine of a playwright ( Clare Quilty ) , who Lolita has a crush on and who Humbert resembles .   Charlotte , Lolita , her friend Mary , and Humbert plan to go to Hourglass Lake for a picnic one Sunday . However , Mary 's mother phones to tell them that Mary is running a fever and that she ca n't go . Mrs. Haze postpones the picnic and , as a result , Lolita refuses to go to church with her . Mrs. Haze leaves for church and Humbert and Lolita are left alone . While the two sing a song , Humbert secretly ejaculates in his pants as Lolita sits on his lap . She does not notice and leaves for the movies . After returning from a lunch in town , Charlotte tells Humbert that Lolita is going to camp Thursday and she wo n't return until the next school"], [496, "The blood sugar concentration or blood glucose level is the amount of glucose ( sugar ) present in the blood of a human or animal . The body naturally tightly regulates blood glucose levels as a part of metabolic homeostasis .   With some exceptions , glucose is the primary source of energy for the body 's cells , and blood lipids ( in the form of fats and oils ) are primarily a compact energy store . Glucose is transported from the intestines or liver to body cells via the bloodstream , and is made available for cell absorption via the hormone insulin , produced by the body primarily in the pancreas .   Glucose levels are usually lowest in the morning , before the first meal of the day ( termed `` the fasting level '' ) , and rise after meals for an hour or two by a few millimolar .  Blood sugar levels outside the normal range may be an indicator of a medical condition . A persistently high level is referred to as hyperglycemia ; low levels are referred to as hypoglycemia . Diabetes mellitus is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia from any of several causes , and is the most prominent disease related to failure of blood sugar regulation . Intake of alcohol causes an initial surge in blood sugar , and later tends to cause levels to fall . Also , certain drugs can increase or decrease glucose levels .   Units   The international standard way of measuring blood glucose levels are in terms of a molar concentration , measured in mmol/L ( millimoles per litre ; or millimolar , abbreviated mM ) . In the United States , West-Germany and other countries mass concentration is measured in mg/dL ( milligrams per decilitre ) .   Since the molecular weight of glucose C6H12O6 is 180 , for the measurement of glucose , the difference between the two scales is a factor of 18 , so that 1 mmol/L of glucose is equivalent to 18 mg/dL .  ——   Normal values in humans   Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories . Many factors affect a person 's blood sugar level . A body 's homeostatic mechanism , when operating normally , restores the blood sugar level to a narrow range of about 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L ( 79.2 to 110 mg/dL ) ( as measured by a fasting blood glucose test ) .   The normal blood glucose level ( tested while fasting ) for non-diabetics , should be between 3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L ( 70 to 100 mg/dL ) . The mean normal blood glucose level in humans is about 5.5 mmol/L ( 100 mg/dL ) ; [ http : //www.faqs.org/faqs/diabetes/faq/part1/section-9.html What are mg/dl and mmol/l ? How to convert ? Glucose ? Cholesterol ? ] Advameg , Inc. however , this level fluctuates throughout the day . Blood sugar levels for those without diabetes and who are not fasting should be below 6.9 mmol/L ( 125 mg/dL ) . The blood glucose target range for diabetics , according to the American Diabetes Association , should be 5–7.2 mmol/l ( 90–130 mg/dL ) before meals , and less than 10 mmol/L ( 180 mg/dL ) after meals ( as measured by a blood glucose monitor ) .   Despite widely variable intervals between meals or the occasional consumption of meals with a substantial carbohydrate load , human blood glucose levels tend to remain within the normal range . However , shortly after eating , the blood glucose level may rise , in non-diabetics , temporarily up to 7.8 mmol/L ( 140 mg/dL ) or slightly more . For people with diabetes maintaining 'tight diabetes control ' , the American Diabetes Association recommends a post-meal glucose level of less than 10 mmol/L ( 180 mg/dL ) and a fasting plasma glucose of 3.9 to 7.2 mmol/L ( 70–130 mg/dL ) .   The actual amount of glucose in the blood and body fluids is very small . In a healthy adult male of 75 kg with a blood volume of 5 liters , a blood glucose level of 5.5 mmol/L ( 100 mg/dL ) amounts to 5g , slightly less than two typical American restaurant sugar packets for coffee or tea . Part of the reason why this amount is so small is that , to maintain an influx of glucose into cells , enzymes modify glucose by adding phosphate or other groups to it .   Animals   In general , ranges of blood sugar in common domestic ruminants are lower than in many monogastric mammals . However this generalization does not extend to wild ruminants"], [497, "Dundee ( ; ) , officially the City of Dundee , is Scotland 's fourth largest city and the 51st most populous built-up area in the United Kingdom . At the 2011 census , Dundee had a population density of 8,541.8/sq mi ( 3,298.0/km2 ) , the second highest of any Scottish city . The mid-year population estimate for 2014 is 148,260 . It lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay , which feeds into the North Sea . Under the name of Dundee City , it forms one of the 32 council areas used for local government in Scotland .   Historically part of Angus , the city developed into a burgh in medieval times , and expanded rapidly in the 19th century largely due to the jute industry . This , along with its other major industries gave Dundee its epithet as city of `` jute , jam and journalism '' . Dundee 's recorded population reached a peak of 182,204 at the 1971 census .   Today , Dundee is promoted as 'One City , Many Discoveries ' in honour of Dundee 's history of scientific activities and of the RRS Discovery , Robert Falcon Scott 's Antarctic exploration vessel , which was built in Dundee and is now berthed in the city harbour . Biomedical and technological industries have arrived since the 1980s , and the city now accounts for 10 % of the United Kingdom 's digital-entertainment industry . Dundee has two universities—the University of Dundee and the Abertay University . In 2014 Dundee was recognised by the United Nations as the UK 's first UNESCO City of Design for its diverse contributions to fields including medical research , comics and video games .   A unique feature of Dundee is that its two professional football clubs have stadiums all but adjacent to each other .   A £1 billion master plan to regenerate and to reconnect the Waterfront to the city centre which started in 2001 is expected to be completed within a 30-year period , with the Dundee Victoria & Albert Museum opening by 2018 at a cost of £80 million .   History   The name `` Dundee '' is made up of two parts : the common Celtic place-name element dun , meaning fort ; and a second part that may derive from a Celtic element , cognate with the Gaelic dè , meaning 'fire ' .   While earlier evidence for human occupation is abundant , Dundee 's success and growth as a seaport town arguably came as a result of William the Lion 's charter , granting Dundee to his younger brother , David ( later Earl of Huntingdon ) in the late 12th century . The situation of the town and its promotion by Earl David as a trading centre led to a period of prosperity and growth . The earldom was passed down to David 's descendants , amongst whom was John Balliol . The town became a Royal Burgh on John 's coronation as king in 1292 . The town and its castle were occupied by English forces for several years during the First War of Independence and recaptured by Robert the Bruce in early 1312 . The original Burghal charters were lost during the occupation and subsequently renewed by Bruce in 1327 .   The burgh suffered considerably during the conflict known as the Rough Wooing of 1543 to 1550 , and was occupied by the English forces of Andrew Dudley from 1547 . In 1548 , unable to defend the town against an advancing Scottish force , Dudley ordered that the town be burnt to the ground . In 1645 , during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms , Dundee was again besieged , this time by the Royalist Marquess of Montrose . The town was finally destroyed by Parliamentarian forces led by George Monck in 1651 . The town played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Jacobite cause when John Graham of Claverhouse , 1st Viscount Dundee raised the Stuart standard on the Dundee Law in 1689 . The town was held by the Jacobites in the 1715–16 rising , and on 6 January 1716 the Jacobite claimant to the throne , James VIII and III ( the Old Pretender ) , made a public entry into the town . Many in Scotland , including many in Dundee , regarded him as the rightful king .   The economy of mediaeval Dundee centred on the export of raw wool , with the production of finished textiles being a reaction to recession in the 15th century .

He is considered by many as the creator of the modern skyscraper , was an influential architect and critic of the Chicago School , was a mentor to Frank Lloyd Wright , and an inspiration to the Chicago group of architects who have come to be known as the Prairie School . Along with Henry Hobson Richardson and Frank Lloyd Wright , Sullivan is one of `` the recognized trinity of American architecture '' . `` Form follows function '' is attributed to him although he credited the origin of the concept to an ancient Roman architect . In 1944 , he was the second architect in history to posthumously receive the AIA Gold Medal .   Early life and career   Louis Henry Sullivan was born to a Swiss-born mother , Andrienne List , and an Irish-born father , Patrick Sullivan , both of whom had immigrated to the United States in the late 1840s . Learning that he could both be graduated from high school a year early and pass up the first two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by passing a series of examinations . Entering MIT at the age of sixteen , he studied architecture there briefly . After one year of study , he moved to Philadelphia and took a job with architect Frank Furness .   The Depression of 1873 dried up much of Furness 's work , and he was forced to let Sullivan go . At that point Sullivan moved on to Chicago in 1873 to take part in the building boom following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 . He worked for William LeBaron Jenney , the architect often credited with erecting the first steel-frame building . After less than a year with Jenney , Sullivan moved to Paris and studied at the École des Beaux-Arts for a year . He returned to Chicago and began work for the firm of Joseph S. Johnston & John Edelman as a draftsman . Johnston & Edleman were commissioned for the design of the Moody Tabernacle , with the interior decorative `` fresco secco '' stencils ( stencil technique applied on dry plaster ) designed by Sullivan . [ http : //www.prairiestyles.com/lsullivan.htm Louis Sullivan ] at www.prairiestyles.com In 1879 Dankmar Adler hired Sullivan . A year later , Sullivan became a partner in the firm . This marked the beginning of Sullivan 's most productive years .   Adler and Sullivan initially achieved fame as theater architects . While most of their theaters were in Chicago , their fame won commissions as far west as Pueblo , Colorado , and Seattle , Washington ( unbuilt ) . The culminating project of this phase of the firm 's history was the 1889 Auditorium Building ( 1886–90 , opened in stages ) in Chicago , an extraordinary mixed-use building that included not only a 4,200-seat theater , but also a hotel and an office building with a 17-story tower with commercial storefronts at the ground level of the building , fronting Congress and Wabash Avenues . After 1889 the firm became known for their office buildings , particularly the 1891 Wainwright Building in St. Louis and the Schiller ( later Garrick ) Building and theater ( 1890 ) in Chicago . Other buildings often noted include the Chicago Stock Exchange Building ( 1894 ) , the Guaranty Building ( also known as the Prudential Building ) of 1895–96 in Buffalo , New York , and the 1899–1904 Carson Pirie Scott Department Store by Sullivan on State Street in Chicago .   Sullivan and the steel high-rise   Prior to the late-nineteenth century , the weight of a multistory building had to be supported principally by the strength of its walls . The taller the building , the more strain this placed on the lower sections of the building ; since there were clear engineering limits to the weight such `` load-bearing '' walls could sustain , large designs meant massively thick walls on the ground floors , and definite limits on the building 's height .   The development of cheap , versatile steel in the second half of the nineteenth century changed those rules . America was in the midst of rapid social and economic growth that made for great opportunities in architectural design . A much more urbanized society was forming and the society called out for new , larger buildings . The mass production of steel was the main driving force behind the ability to build skyscrapers during"], [499, "West Africa , also called Western Africa and the West of Africa , is the westernmost subcontinent of Africa . West Africa has been defined as including the 18 countries Benin , Burkina Faso , the island of Cape Verde , Gambia , Ghana , Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , Ivory Coast , Liberia , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , the island of Saint Helena , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Sao Tome and Principe and Togo .   History   The history of West Africa can be divided into five major periods : first , its prehistory , in which the first human settlers arrived , developed agriculture , and made contact with peoples to the north ; the second , the Iron Age empires that consolidated both intra-African , and extra-African trade , and developed centralized states ; third , major polities flourished , which would undergo an extensive history of contact with non-Africans ; fourth , the colonial period , in which Great Britain and France controlled nearly the whole of the region ; and fifth , the post-independence era , in which the current nations were formed .   Prehistory   Early human settlers from northern Holocene societies arrived in West Africa around 12,000 B.C . Sedentary farming began in , or around the fifth millennium B.C , as well as the domestication of cattle . By 1500 B.C , ironworking technology allowed an expansion of agricultural productivity , and the first city-states later formed . Northern tribes developed walled settlements and non-walled settlements that numbered at 400 . In the forest region , Iron Age cultures began to flourish , and an inter-region trade began to appear . The desertification of the Sahara and the climatic change of the coast cause trade with upper Mediterranean peoples to be seen .   The domestication of the camel allowed the development of a trans-Saharan trade with cultures across the Sahara , including Carthage and the Berbers ; major exports included gold , cotton cloth , metal ornaments and leather goods , which were then exchanged for salt , horses , textiles , and other such materials . Local leather , cloth , and gold also contributed to the abundance of prosperity for many of the following empires .   Empires   The development of the region 's economy allowed more centralized states and civilizations to form , beginning with the Nok culture that began in 1000 B.C . and the Ghana Empire that first flourished between the 1st and 3rd centuries , which later gave way to the Mali Empire . In current-day Mauritania , there exist archaeological sites in the towns of Tichit and Oualata that were initially constructed around 2000 B.C. , and were found to have originated from the Soninke branch of the Mandé peoples . Also , based on the archaeology of city of Kumbi Saleh in modern-day Mauritania , the Mali empire came to dominate much of the region until its defeat by Almoravid invaders in 1052 .   The Sosso Empire sought to fill the void , but was defeated ( c. 1240 ) by the Mandinka forces of Sundiata Keita , founder of the new Mali Empire . The Mali Empire continued to flourish for several centuries , most particularly under Sundiata 's grandnephew Musa I , before a succession of weak rulers led to its collapse under Mossi , Tuareg and Songhai invaders . In the 15th century , the Songhai would form a new dominant state based on Gao , in the Songhai Empire , under the leadership of Sonni Ali and Askia Mohammed .   Meanwhile , south of the Sudan , strong city states arose in Igboland , such as the 10th-century Kingdom of Nri , which helped birth the arts and customs of the Igbo people , Bono in the 12th century , which eventually culminated in the formation the all-powerful Akan Empire of Ashanti , while Ife and Benin City rose to prominence around the 14th century . Further east , Oyo arose as the dominant Yoruba state and the Aro Confederacy as a dominant Igbo state in modern-day Nigeria .   Slavery and European contact   Portuguese traders began establishing settlements along the coast in 1445 , followed by the French , English Spanish Danish and Dutch ; the African slave trade began not long after , which over the following centuries would debilitate the region 's economy and population . The slave trade also encouraged the formation of states such as the Asante Empire , Bambara Empire and Dahomey , whose economic activities include but not limited to exchanging slaves for European firearms .

Question and ModContext:[[[0, 'what colour is the number 10 on the door of 10 downing street? white, yellow or brown?', 'The absence of color in white is known as achromatic color.The human eye produces white light when it receives an incoming beam of light that stimulates all three color-sensitive cone cells.The most common colors in nature, including white, are sunlight, snow, milk, chalk, limestone, and other common minerals.White is a symbol for purity, innocence, and light in many cultures, representing the opposite of darkness or black.Surveys conducted in Europe and the United States reveal that white is the color most commonly linked to perfection, good behavior, honesty, cleanliness, the start of life, new experiences, neutrality, and exactitude.In ancient Egypt and Rome, priestesses wore white garments to symbolize purity, while Romans donned white toga pants as a symbol of citizenship.A white unicorn in the Middle Ages and Renaissance was a symbol of purity and chastity, along with sacrifices of pious animals such as white lamb;The color of mourning for king\'s widows was white, not black.At times, it is a mark of imperial status;The color of the French monarchs and monarchist movement following the Revolution was black, as well as the White Russians who fought against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922.Greek and Roman temples were decorated with white marble, and from the 18th century onwards, white became the dominant color in new government buildings like churches and capitols. This trend was evident in the United States during the neoclassical period.Modern architecture of the 20th century frequently employed it as a symbol of both modernity and strength, with simplicity and simplicity being prominent among its features.Almost all world religions consider white to be an essential color.As a symbol of purity and sacrifice, the Pope has worn white since 1566 as the head of the Roman Catholic Church.It is worn by Muslims in Islam and Shinto practitioners in Japan;The Brahmins in India.Wedding dresses in Western cultures and Japan are typically dressed in white, which represents purity and virginity.In numerous Asian societies, white is the color of mourning.The RGB color model creates the white color on television screens and computer monitors by combining red, green, and blue light at equal intensities.Alps, being white in nature and culture.The image displays snow and ice.In the high Alps lies the Weisshorn, also known as the "white mountain".File: Milk glass.The image depicts a glass of milk and displays the cloud.Taj Mahal Edit | Pictorial: Mule Clouds.Taj Mahal, White marble jpegAn ivory background is featured in the Lorsch Gospels\' cover.The Carolingian, Victoria and Albert Museum is located in 810.The Victoria and Albert Museum in London possesses an Ivory cover for the Lorsch Gospels, which were written circa 810 AD.File: Three Maries.At the Warsaw Museum, there is an Arkansas statue of the three Maries (c. 1450).Andalusian in the file.An image of a white Andalusian horse.White is commonly associated with innocence, perfection, and purity.ANWR: Young polar bears in the enclosure.A photo of polar bears with their young taken in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.The file contains six Douvres.Calcium carbonate, also known as chalk, is the material used to create the White Cliffs of Dover in JPG.The white appearance of snow and clouds in nature is due to the inclusion of water droplets or ice crystals in the air; other natural phenomena also exist.Very little of the spectrum is absorbed when white sunlight enters snow;The snow\'s white appearance is due to the fact that most of the light is reflected or dispersed by the air and water molecules.The presence of quartz or eroded limestone in beaches with sand contributes to their white appearance, as these materials reflect or scatter sunlight instead of absorption.Fine white sand beaches often feature fine white calcium carbonate resulting from seashells that are ground up by the waves.The term leukophobe is used to describe someone who has a negative or hostile view towards the color white.']], [[1, 'what was the first name of the jazz trombonist kid ory?', 'Ory, a jazz trombonist and bandleader, was born in 1886 and lived from December to January 23, 1973.He was born in Woodland Plantation, which is situated near La Place, Louisiana.Ory\'s background: He started playing home-made instruments as a child and by the time he was 15 his band was in Southeast Louisiana.He chose to keep La Place, Louisiana, as his base of operations due to family responsibilities until his twenty-first birthday, after which he transferred his band to New Orleans, LA.One of the most influential trombonists in early jazz was his own.During his childhood, Ory played the banjo and is believed to have developed a unique style of playing the trombone, known as "troops."A rhythmic line is played by the trombone beneath the trumpets and cornets in a tailgate style.Buddy Bolden came across Ory\'s New trombone, not his old civil war one, while he resided on Jackson Avenue.His sister stated that he was too young to play with Bolden.Ory\'s band was one of the most prominent in New Orleans during the 1910s, and it attracted a number of notable jazz musicians, including Joe  King \'\' Oliver, Mutt Carey, Louis Armstrong, who joined the group in 1919; others also played or were involved in other musical ventures.Clarinetists Johnny Dodds and Jimmie Noone are also present.After relocating to Los Angeles in 1919, he recorded his first album with a band that featured Mutt Carey, Dink Johnson, and Ed Garland.The friendship between Garland and Carey persisted during Ory\'s return in the 1940s.During their time in Los Angeles, Ory and his band recorded two instrumental tracks,  Oryer\'s Creole Trombone and a few songs.An African-American jazz band from New Orleans produced the first jazz recordings on the west coast.The recording company Nordskog paid for the pressings of their recordings, which were later sold under his own label Kid Ory\'s Sunshine Orchestra at a store called Spikes Brothers Music Store in Los Angeles.Ory was very active in Chicago in 1925, working and recording with Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Oliver, Johnny Dodds, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, and many others.He served as a mentor to Benny Goodman and later Charles Mingus.During the Great Depression, Ory stopped playing music and did not return until 1943.He was in charge of one of the most exceptional New Orleans style bands of his time, from 1944 to around 1961.Mutt Carey, Ed Garland, Alvin Alcorn, and Teddy Buckner are among the trumpeters.Clarinetists such as Darnell Howard, Jimmie Noone, Albert Nicholas, Barney Bigard, and George Probert;Buster Wilson, Cedric Haywood, and Don Ewell are all accomplished pianists;During this period, he had drummer Minor Hall as one of his sidemen.Probert, Buckner, and Ewell were the only ones who hailed from New Orleans.By creating popular radio broadcasts during the 1940s, including several spots on The Orson Welles Almanac program, the Ory band was instrumental in revitalizing jazz in New Orleans.The group recorded a series of tracks on the Crescent Records label in 1944-45, which was founded by Nesuhi Ertegun to record Ory\'s band.Ory and his companions made an appearance at the Beverly Cavern in Los Angeles during the late 1940s and early 1950s.With Trummy Young\'s help, Ory spent his final years in Hawaii after retiring from music in 1966.Ory met his demise in Honolulu.Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California was the final resting place for him.']], [[2, 'in the shakespeare play ‘the tempest’, prospero is the overthrown duke of ‘where’?', 'The Tempest by William Shakespeare features a character in the fictional play Prospero.Antonio, the brother of the rightful Duke of Milan, had put him and his daughter Miranda aboard a decaying boat to perish, 12 years before the play begins.Miranda and Prospero managed to survive and were subsequently exiled to a small island.While on the island, he employs his book-based magic to safeguard Miranda and manage the other characters.Prospero\'s powerful wizardry has the ability to manipulate weather patterns, raise dead bodies, and even euthanize them. in the opening scene of Act V.Caliban, the son of Sycorax, is taken over by Prospero while on the island, and he is coerced into submission by being punished with magic.Ariel holds onto Prospero after being released from his confinement in the piney.The play concludes with Prospero\'s plan to drown his book and abandon magic.According to the audience, this could have been necessary to ensure a clear and unambiguous conclusion, as magic was linked to wicked creations.In the same way that Doctor Faust had promised to burn his books alive in a previous play by Christopher Marlowe, he will drown them all.The Tempest\'s final soliloquy and epilogue, delivered by Prospero, is widely regarded as one of the most remarkable speeches in Shakespearean literature.I have lost all my charms and the strength in it is mine alone. If this were true, I would be confined by you or sent to Naples.Despite having my princedom and pardoning the fraudster, I am not allowed to reside on this island by your will;I need your help to release me from my bands, but if I don\'t use your gentle breath, my project will not be successful.My wish is for the implementation of Spirits, art to edify, and my ultimate destination will be despair, unless I receive help through prayer that liberates me from all misfortunes.Your indulgence would free me from the burden of criminal activity.Prospero asserts that he has been defeated by magic and will continue to be imprisoned if the audience is unhappy.Many believe that Prospero\'s emotions are a reflection of Shakespearean sentiments, possibly due to his retirement speech, as The Tempest was the last play he wrote independently.In a BBC Play of the Month production in 1968, Sir Michael Redgrave took on the role of Prospero.Heathcote Williams starred as Prospero in the 1979 film adaptation of The Tempest, directed by Derek Jarman.A BBC television production from 1980 featured Sir Michael Hordern as Prospero.The Stratford Shakespeare Festival production, featuring Len Cariou as Prospero, was recorded and aired on television in 1983.Paul Mazursky\'s Tempest, released in 1983, portrays John Cassavetes as a character who escapes America and settles in vengeful Greece on opulent island islands.In the 1991 film Prospero\'s Books, John Gielgud plays the role of Provano, a character originally played by Peter Greenaway.Helen Mirren starred as Prospero in Julie Taymor\'s 2010 film adaptation of the play, which is now known as "Prospera."']], [[3, "who voiced count duckula in an animated 1980's and 1990's television series of the same name?", "Cosgrove Hall, a British studio, created Count Duckula, an animated comedy-drama dark fantasy television series that was based on Danger Mouse, where the character played henchback.Count Duckula, produced by Thames Television, made its debut in four series from 6 September 1988 to 16 February 1993.The series was composed of 65 episodes, each lasting around 22 minutes.The U.S. has seen all of them released on DVD.K.The first series is the only one that has been released in North America.The Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle cartoon hour, produced by Filmation, was the inspiration for this show's short-lived 1979 episode, Quackula.A spin-off of Danger Mouse, History Count Duckula was created by Cosgrove Hall, a British studio.Danger Mouse, a hit for the channel, was bought by Nickelodeon in 1984.A new series was sought to co-produce by the management of Nickelodeon after a few years at Cosgrove Hall.Jenny Lebron, the former head of Nickelodeon, was presented with several ideas by Brian Cosgrove when she saw a picture of Count Duckula in his office and decided to give him one.The idea of a vegetarian diet was suggested by one of the series writers, which made the concept more unique.Gaston and Pierre were given a spinoff series as human Victor and Hugo, following the example of Duckula's Danger Mouse adaptation.In North American comics published by Star Comics, Count Duckula introduced a new aspect to his version that distinguished him from previous versions.Duckula's version uses ketchup as the substitute for blood in the resurrection ceremony.Duckula's passport was obtained through a blood test, which led to the discovery of an imaginary country that produced fried chicken.Despite being used as a formal identification for the country, Duckula, Nanny, and Igor were not included in the photo due to the stereotype that vampires are not depicted in movies.The Star Comics run would also attract Duckula's romantic interest;The niece of his long-standing adversary, Vanna Von Goosewing.The name of Von Goosewing.The pair's love affair was mutual, and they remained in a relationship for most of the series, although Vanna wasn't present in every book.The plot of several episodes highlights the idea that every resurrection leads to a new life with no memory of its previous existence, known as the current father.Therefore, each persona can freely develop its own identity and pursue distinct personal pursuits.The vampire can pretend to be a terrible dynasty, which is the reason for Duckula's crimes.Knights, sorcerers, scientists, artists, Egyptianologists, and professional gamblers were all part of the previous generations.The title sequence suggests that the latest reincarnation did not work as planned.Blood is the necessary ingredient for the successful conclusion of the ritual, which is reminiscent of Hammer Dracula films and provides vital nutrients to vampires. However, Nanny mistakenly uses tomato ketchup instead.As a result, the latest model is not based on vampires that consume blood, but rather vegetarians.He prioritizes savoring juicy carrots over seeking out victims.Igor is displeased.The new master of the family is obsessed with becoming an entertainer and achieving fame and wealth, which is even more concerning.The stories often revolve around Duckula's quest to achieve fame and wealth, with the castle being able to teleport worldwide.Igor's repeated efforts to transform Duckula into a genuine vampire are another common theme.Doctor Von Goosewing, who is based on Dr., serves as Duckula's adversary in certain episodes.Abraham Van Helsing, the antagonist of Dracula, is a vampire hunter who refuses to accept the current version of Duckula as harmless."]], [[4, 'in what year was the most recent census in the uk ?', "Every decade since 1801, coincident full censuses have been conducted in various jurisdictions of the United Kingdom, with the exception of 1941 and both Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State in 1921.The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man conducted simultaneous censuses, and their returns were kept in conjunction with those of England.In addition to offering comprehensive national demographic data, the census results are crucial in determining the allocation of funds to regional and local service providers by the UK and European Union governments.The last census in the UK was conducted in 2011.In Roman times, Britain made History Tax assessments, also known as the indiction, but detailed records have not been preserved.Dál Riata, situated in the 7th century AD, conducted a census that is now known as the  Tradition of the Men of Alba (Senchus fer n-Alban).William I compiled the Domesday Book in 1086 for tax purposes, marking the first official census in England.Unlike previous censuses that were not as comprehensive,g.In 1801, John Rickman, a statistician, initiated the use of national decennial censuses of the general population for religious purposes.Initially, the censuses were conducted to determine the number of men capable of participating in the Napoleonic Wars, and later to address population concerns that were influenced by Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus' 1798 publication An Essay on the Principle of Population.In 1798, Rickman presented a set of twelve reasons for conducting. He included the following: 1. The intimate knowledge of any country must be the rationale behind legislation and diplomacy; 2. The size of an industrious population should be known; 3. The number of men required for conscription into the militia in different areas should reflect the area's population; 4.Since 1801, there have been frequent national censuses, with the most recent one taking place in 2011;Some fifth anniversaries have had other partial censuses between them.The initial four censuses (1801-1831) were mainly focused on statistics, with minimal personal information and only a few headcounts.Local record offices have a few older records that were produced by enumerators using notes from earlier censuses; these notes are now in existence.These could encompass all individuals or solely the heads of households.The 1841 Census marked the first time that the names of all individuals in a household or establishment were intentionally recorded.The law that governs all censuses in Great Britain (which includes Scotland, England, and Wales) was established by the Census Act of 1920.In 1969, the first act of legislation was passed in Northern Ireland.Prior to this legislation, each census needed to be conducted through a separate act of parliament.Many of Britain's colonies abroad were responsible for initiating and coordinating censuses.The absence of a census in 1941 was due to the disruption caused by the Second World War.Despite this, the implementation of the National Registration Act 1939 on 5 September resulted in a population count on 29 September 19 39.The National Register's creation led to the creation of the NHS Central Register.Great Britain's censuses were conducted on 26 April 1931, but the Second World War caused an accidental fire that destroyed the returns for England and Wales.Long/short form enumeration was experimented with in the UK on 24 April 1966.The families were all given short forms to fill out, and some members were given long forms as part of their own survey to obtain more specific information."]], [[5, 'which actor was the fifth doctor who from 1982-1984, and in that role often wore edwardian cricket

through time and space in his TARDIS, often with companions.The Doctor can regenerate his body if he sustains severe injuries;As a result, his physical appearance and personality undergo alterations.The sixth version starring Baker is the most daring of him, dressed in mismatched clothing and bright colours, with a bold and assertive demeanor that sets him apart from all previous versions.The Sixth Doctor was introduced after three seasons.He made an appearance in the final episode of The Caves of Androzani, which highlighted the rebirth of the Fifth Doctor, and then again in subsequent serial The Twin Dilemma at the conclusion of that season.BBC controller Michael Grade decided to take an 18-month break between seasons 22 and 23 of The Sixth Doctor's era, during which only one new Doctor Who story, Slipback, was broadcasted on BBC Radio 4 in 6 parts at 10 minutes each.The previous actor, Peter Davison, had left the company after only three years, while Colin Baker had been enrolled for four years.Before its postponement, season 23 had already been developed, with episodes already drafted and distributed to both cast and production.Despite the postponement of the season, the remaining stories were still being developed in a 25-minute episode format.The season was relaunched in mid 1985, leading to the abandonment of all previous ones and the introduction

to be Earth, and experienced severe aftermaths as they journeyed across space.The TARDIS disembarked on Thoros Beta before the cause of the disaster was established.It is uncertain what occurred here, but initial reports suggest that Peri was killed as a test subject for brain transplant experiments and the Doctor was subsequently taken to X-Ray in Revelation while being trialed by the Time Lords.The trial was a cover-up that was organized by the High Council.To safeguard their planet, the Time Lords traveled from Andromeda with a group of people who had stolen time Lord secrets, setting fire to Earth and leaving it as Ravolox.The Valeyard, as discovered by the prosecutor during the trial, was a potential embodiment of the Doctor's evil version who was determined to take his remaining

acclaim.The unscripted television movie Magical Mystery Tour was the only exception and received negative reviews from both critics and viewers.Their films were named after their soundtrack album, each with a specific song.The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night (64) marked the beginning of their successful film career, featuring a loosely scripted comic farce that was sometimes compared to the Marx Brothers' style.Richard Lester directed a black-and-white film that focused on Beatlemania and the band's hectic touring schedule. The director was known for his work on The Running, Jumping, and Standing Still Film, as well as his previous projects with Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan.The four members' journey to a London TV show is mocked in the film A Hard Day's Night.At the height of Beatlemania, the film was released and received favorable reviews from critics, while it remains one of the most influential jukebox

to Elias Howe, who invented the sewing machine in 1846.It was the initial Beatles movie to be filmed in color.McCartney came up with the idea for the Magical Mystery Tour movie after a trip to the United States.S.McCartney was influenced by the media's coverage of Ken Kesey'Smiles with LSD and his American bus trip in late 1967.McCartney was motivated to merge his ideas with the idiosyncratic English custom of charabanc mystery tours, which involved children taking guided bus rides through the English countryside, destination not specified.BBC-1, the premier television network, chose not to broadcast the film on Boxing Day due to its critical reception, despite its reputation as a classic for family-friendly and cozy entertainment.Despite its historical significance as an early entry point into the music video era, many viewers found the film to be plot-less and confusing at the time.Despite the film being made in color and using color filters in certain scenes, the culture clash was compounded by the fact that no one in the UK had access to a colour receiver when the service was launched just months before in December 1967.Despite The Beatles' direct involvement, the 1968

created l.h.o.o.q., a parody of the mona lisa, in which a moustache and goatee beard were added to a reproduction of the painting?', 'The European avant-garde art movement known as Dada or Dadatism emerged in the early 20th century.Dada in Zürich, Switzerland, started in 1916 at Cabaret Voltaire and quickly spread to Berlin, but reached its zenith in New York City in 1915.In 1913, Marcel Duchamp introduced the term anti-art, which was a precursor to Dada, when he created his first readymades.Dada was not only against war but also against the bourgeoisie and had political connections with the radical left.Ubu Roi by Alfred Jarry and the ballet Parade by Erik Satie, both of which were considered pre-Dadaist works, had already enlightened audiences and artists.The roots of Dada can be found in the avant-garde movement that existed before the wars.Through the use of Cubism, collage, and Wassily Kandinsky\'s theoretical writings and abstraction, the movement broke away from the constraints of reality and convention.The writings of German Expressionists and the influence of French poets liberated Dada from the tight bond between words and meaning.The avant-garde outside of France was aware of the changes that occurred in Paris before the war.The Cubist exhibitions that they were present at included Galera Dalmau, Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin, Armory in New York, SVU Mánes in Prague, Jack of Diamonds in Moscow, and De Moderne Kunstkring in Amsterdam from 1911 to 1915.The work of multiple artists sparked the development of Futurism.Later on, Dada integrated these techniques.Dada activities encompassed public events, demonstrations, and the publication of art and literary journals;Art, politics, and culture were frequently the focus of passionate coverage in various media outlets.Hugo Ball, Emmy Hennings, Hans Arp, Raoul Hausmann, Hannah Höch, Johannes Baader, Tristan Tzara, Francis Picabia, Richard Huelsenbeck, George Grosz, John Heartfield, Marcel Duchamp, Beatrice Wood, Kurt Schwitters, and Hans Richter were among the key figures in the movement.The movement had an impact on later styles, including avant-garde and downtown music, as well as surrealism, Nouveau Réalisme, pop art, and Fluxus.An informal global movement, Dada Overview, had participants in Europe and North America.The inception of Dada coincides with the start of World War I.The movement was viewed by many participants as a means of protesting against the cultural and intellectual norms that were associated with the war, as well as the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist ideals.The belief that bourgeois capitalist society\'s rationality and logic caused people to engage in war was held by many Dadaists.They expressed their rejection of that ideology through artistic expression that seemed to reject logic and instead embrace chaos and irrationality.George Grosz remembered that his Dadaist artwork was intended to be a form of protest against the world of mutual destruction."According to Hans Richter Dada, this was not art but anti-art."The opposite of what art meant was Dada.Traditional aesthetics were a significant factor in art, but Dada disregarded them.Art should appeal to sensibilities, but Dada\'s aim was to offend.As Hugo Ball put it, art is not an end in itself.The.The.Nevertheless, it presents an occasion for the authentic comprehension and evaluation of our current circumstances.A reviewer from the American Art News stated that Dada philosophy is the most sickening, paralyzing, and damaging thing that has ever been derived from human thought.According to art historians, Dada was largely a response to the collective killing of many artists.After some time, artists in the Dada family depicted the movement as a phenomenon that emerged during the postwar economic and moral crisis, serving as both savior and monster, and besieging everything along its path.The.The.It was a methodical effort to devastate and

superior to that of other jobs.Prior to founding Apple Computer in 1976, Wayne had a long career with Steve Jobs at Atari.The venture was overseen by Wayne, who drew the first Apple logo, wrote the original partnership agreement and produced both the manual and Apple I guide.On April 12, 1976, Wayne paid a 10% interest in Apple but later agreed to pay US $ 800 for his equity.All members of a partnership are legally bound to assume responsibility for any debts owed by any partner.In contrast to Jobs and Wozniak, who were both 21 and 25 years old, Wayne had personal assets that could be taken by potential creditors.His decision to leave the partnership was influenced by the failure of a slot machine company he had founded five years prior.Venture capitalist Arthur Rock and Mike Markkula played a role in developing shrewd business ideas and transforming the partnership into an enterprise later that year.Wayne was compensated $ 1,500 for agreeing to waive any claims against the new company, one year after his departure from Apple.Apple's sales for its first year of operation in 1976 amounted to US$174,000.Sales reached US$ 2 in 1977.The US dollar was reduced to 7 million

significant obstacles in his path to steer clear of the Apple enterprise.I had already undergone a rather unfavorable business encounter.My age was rapidly increasing, and those two events were whirlwinds.I felt like I was being chased by a tiger with its tail, and it was almost impossible to keep up with these guys.Following his departure from Apple, Wayne resisted attempts to have Jobs come back to him and continued working for Atari until 1978 when he became a part of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and later an electronics company in Salinas, California.Wayne sold stamps and rare coins at a mobile home park in Pahrump, Nevada, where he retired.Aral Balkan presented Wayne with an iPad 2 during the Update Conference in Brighton, England in 2011, having previously never owned any Apple products.In the late 1970s, Wayne operated a stamp shop called Wayne's Philatelics in Milpitas.He transferred his stamp operations to Nevada after a series of break-ins.A wood-cut design was used for the business's logo, which featured a man sitting under an apple tree and adorned with philatelics letters.The initial logo of Apple Computer was also created by him.The original contract for the Apple company, signed in 1976 by Jobs, Wozniak, and himself, was sold by Wayne for $ 500 during the early 1990s.The contract was auctioned off for 1 dollar in 2011.A sum of 6

architecture is present throughout Europe and marks the first pan-European architectural style to exist since Imperial Roman Architecture.The Romanesque style in England is commonly referred to as Norman architecture.The fusion of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings with local traditions results in the imposing nature of Romanesque architecture, which is distinguished by its massive quality, thick walls, round arches, sturdy pillars, groin vaults/large towers (and other decorative ornamentation), and monumental arcades.Every structure has clearly defined forms, often with a uniform and symmetrical layout;In comparison to the Gothic edifices that came after, they have an unadorned appearance.Despite the differences in materials and regional characteristics, the style can be easily

that were less prosperous in later times, such as southern France, northern Spain, and rural Italy.Although unfortified Romanesque secular houses and palaces have survived, monasteries use a domestic scale that incorporates the features found in church buildings.The Oxford English Dictionary states that the term "Romanesque" denotes a descendant of the Roman Empire and was initially used in English to describe the current Romance languages, which were first mentioned in 1715.The architectural sense of the French word \'was first used by Charles de Gerville, an archaeologist, in a letter

architecture from the 5th to the 13th centuries.The publication of An Inquiry into the Origin and Influence of Gothic Architecture (London 1819) by William Gunn marks the first time it has been used.The term was employed by Gunn to characterize the style that was recognizable as Medieval and predicted the Gothic, while still retaining the round Roman arch and appearing to be a continuation of the Roman construction tradition.The term is now used to refer to a limited time frame from the late 10th to the 12th century.Pre-romanesque architecture in Germany during the Carolingian and Ottonian periods, as well as Visigothic, Mozarab, and Asturian constructions in the Iberian Peninsula between the 8th and 10th centuries, is sometimes referred to as pre-Romanesque.

players playing on the same field is known as cricket. The pitch in the center is rectangular and 22 yards long, with a wicket and three wooden stumps placed at each end for safety.The batting team endeavors to score as many runs as possible while competing against their opponents.The term "innings" is used to denote every stage of the game.When either ten batsmen are dismissed or a specific number of overs have been played, the innings concludes and the two teams switch sides.The team that scores the most runs, including any extras, during their innings is known as the winning team.The field of play is always occupied by eleven fielders and two batsmen at the beginning of each game.At the start of the game, the ball is delivered by the bowler from the fielding team to a set of wooden stumps, with the batsman being placed in front of it.The striker\'s task is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps and score runs by striking it well.The non-striker batsman waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler.The bowler\'s objective is to prevent runs and then discard the batsman, resulting in his departure from the field while another player takes over at the crease.The most common types of dismissal are bowled, which involves the bowler hitting the stumps with their legs and wicket, caught, or batting.The scoring of runs can be achieved through either striking the ball with enough force to cross the boundary or having the batsmen run in opposite directions while the fielders are retrieving the pitch.The wicket can be left out of reach by either batsman, resulting in a run-out as the fielder retrieves the ball quickly.On-field adjudication is carried out by two umpires.The ICC and MCC are responsible for upholding the rules of cricket.The formats available include Twenty20, which involves each team playing a single 20-overs innings, and Test cricket, where teams play two innings each over five days with unlimited overs.In the past, cricketers have traditionally donned white uniforms, but in limited overs matches, they opt for their team or club colours.In addition to their basic equipment, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury from the ball, which is made of cork and compressed leather.The origins of cricket are uncertain, but it was first recorded in south-east England during the 16th century.With the expansion of the British Empire, it became a global phenomenon and there were initial international matches in the mid-19th century.The ICC, the game\'s governing body, has a total of 100-members, including 10 full members who are Test cricketers.The international standard for women\'s cricket, played separately and in an organised manner, has been established.The world\'s second most popular spectator sport is cricket, which is predominantly

The C Major scale has 52 white key keys, while the Black Keys have 36 shorter lengths to accommodate the "accidental" notes needed to play in all 12 modes.Pressing or striking the keys causes the strings to be sounded, and when they are released, a damper is used to silence them.The use of pedals at the base of the instrument enables the notes to be sustained, even when the keys are not in use.While the pipe organ and harpsichord were previously considered major keyboard instruments, the dynamics and tone of these instruments are altered by how much weight or force is applied by the performer to press or strike the keys.The piano\'s keyboard causes a padded hammer, often with strong felt padding, to hit the strings when one or more keys are pressed.The strings are released by the hammer, and they continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency.A bridge links the vibrations to a soundboard, which enhances their quality by better coupling coustic energy to the air.A damper is used to cancel the sound caused by the strings when the key is released.An acoustic piano with strings is commonly classified as percussion rather than stringed due to its being struck instead of plucked, unlike some harpsichord or spinet instruments.The Hornbostel-Sachs system categorizes instruments and classifies them as chordophones, including pianos.Technological progress has led to the creation of electric, electronic, and digital pianos.Jazz fusion and rock music in the 1960s and 1970s saw an increase in popularity of the electric piano.The term piano is a contraction of the Italian word for instrument, pianoforte, which is composed of gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano.Italian musical terms for piano and forte refer to the variations in sound produced by a pianist touching the keys, with higher velocity and stronger force being used to produce different sounds.Earlier technological advancements in keyboard instruments served as the foundation for the piano\'s development.The Middle Ages in Europe saw the emergence of hammered dulcimers, which were the first string instruments with struck strings.During the Middle Ages, there were numerous efforts to produce keyboard instruments that utilized struck strings.The 17th century saw the well-developed mechanisms of keyboard instruments, including the clavichord and harpsichorald.The strings of a clavichord are struck by tangents, while those of the harpsichored are mechanically plucked by quills when the key is depressed.The harpsichord\'s mechanism had been studied for centuries, leading to the identification of optimal methods for creating a keyboard case, soundboard, bridge, and mechanical action.Bartolomeo Cristofori, who worked as the Keeper of the Instruments for Ferdinando de\'Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany and lived in Padua, Italy, is credited with inventing the modern piano.He had a skillful background in making harpsichords and was well-versed in the field of stringed keyboard instruments.']], [[18, 'where did the shinning path terrorists operate?', 'The Shining Path, a radical group in Peru, is commonly known as the Communist Party of Peru or Partido Comunista del Per.In 1980, the group initiated the internal conflict in Peru with the aim of replacing what it perceived as bourgeois democracy with "New Democracy."The Shining Path aimed to achieve pure communism by creating a dictatorship of the unemployed, initiating cultural revolutions and eventually sparking global revolution.The representatives of these countries claimed that the current socialist nations were revisionist and proclaimed themselves as the pioneers of the global communist movement.Other Maoist insurgent groups, such as the Communist Party of Nepal and Revolutionary Internationalist Movement-affiliated groups like The National Democratic Party, have been influenced by the Shining Path\'s ideology and tactics.Its brutality has resulted in widespread criticism, as seen by the website http: //www.Britannica.The encyclopedia of Britannica, "Shining-Path" (en) [com/eb/article-9067404/].On June 11th, 2009, the Peruvian government and the U.S. have classified the

the founder of the first Peruvian Communist Party in the 1920s, that "Marxismo-Leninism will open the shining path to revolution."A front group of Shining Path had this maxim printed in their newspaper masthead.The titles of publications are frequently used to differentiate Peruvian communist organizations.The followers of this group are commonly referred to as senderistas.The organization\'s production includes documents, periodicals, and other materials that are signed by the Communist Party of Peru (PCP).PCP-SL is a common name for them among academics.Abimael Guzmán, a former university professor of philosophy and known as Presidente Gonzalo, founded Origins The Shining Path in the late 1960s.Its militant Maoist ideology was rooted in his teachings.It was a derivative of the Communist Party of Peru, Bandera Roja (red flag), which later separated from the original Peruvian Communist Parties, which were founded by José Carlos Mariátegui in 1928.Guzmán taught philosophy at San Cristóbal of Huamanga University in Ayacucho, where the Shining Path was established.After being closed for around 50 years, the university recently reopened and many students adopted the Shining Path\'s radical ideology.The student councils in Huancayo and La Cantuta were under the control of Shining Path members from 1973 to 1975, while the National University of Engineering and the NSU of San Marcos saw significant involvement.Many student elections in universities, including San Cristóbal of Huamanga by Guzmán, were lost at a later time.The decision was made to discontinue recruiting at universities and restructure.The second plenary of the Central Committee, which was organized by Shining Path, began on March 17, 1980, when they held a series of covert gatherings in Ayacucho.Despite China\'s economic success since 1978 and the revisionism instituted by Deng Xiaoping, it established a political and military "Revolutionary Directorate" and instructed

the South American wars of independence.The Copa Bridgestone Libertadores is the name given to the tournament, which is currently sponsored by Bridge stone.Throughout its existence, the competition has undergone several different formats.The South American leagues were the only ones that participated in the beginning.The South American leagues' runners-up began to become members in 1966.Since 1998, Mexican teams have been invited to participate and have regularly participated since 2000, when the tournament was expanded from 20 to 32 teams.At least three clubs from each country participate in the tournament today, with Argentina and Brazil having five clubs each.In the past, a group stage has been utilized, but the number of teams in each group has fluctuated multiple times.The current tournament format comprises of six stages, with the first stage taking place in early February.The second stage involves 26 teams, with the remaining six teams from the first stage being replaced by eight groups comprising four teams each.The eight group winners and runners-up move on to the knockout stages, which are the final four stages that take place between June and August.The Copa Libertadores champion is granted the opportunity to participate in both the FIFA Club World Cup and the Recopa Sudamericana.With seven successive victories, the Independiente team has become the most successful club in the history of the cup.With a total of 23 wins, Argentina has the most victories among clubs, and Brazil has more teams than any other country, with 10 different clubs having won the competition.The cup has been won by 24 clubs, with 13 of them having won the title more than once and six being consecutive winners.Argentine side River Plate emerged as the winners of their third title, defeating Tigres UANL from Mexico.The Copa Ro de La Plata confrontations between Argentina and Uruguay's champions in the 1930s motivated the notion of a continental competition.The South American Championship of Champions was played and organized by Colo-Colo, a Chilean club, in 1948 after years of planning and organization, making it the direct forerunner to the Copa Libertadores.The summit was held in Santiago to bring together the champions of the leading national leagues from each country.Vasco da Gama emerged victorious in the tournament.The board leaders of Pearol established the competition's structure and foundation in 1958.The International Affairs Committee granted approval to the competition during the 24th South American Congress in Buenos Aires on March 5th, 1959.In 1966, the city was named in memory of South American liberation hero José Gervasio Artigas, Bernardo O'Higgins, José de San Martn, Pedro I, and Simón Bolvar, among others.The Copa Libertadores was first introduced in 1960 and it ran until 1969.Bahia, Jorge Wilstermann, Millonarios, Olimpiy, Pearol, San Lorenzo, and Universidad de Chile were the seven teams that participated.The year 1959 saw all of these teams win domestic titles in their respective leagues.The first Copa Libertadores match was played on April 19, 1960.Jorge Wilstermann was defeated 7-1 by Pearol in the match.The first goal in the history of Copa Libertadores was scored by Carlos Borges of Pearol.The Uruguayans won the inaugural tournament and emerged victorious over Olimpia in the finals, ultimately defending their championship in 1961.The third edition of the Copa Libertadores did not receive much international attention due to the exceptional playing of Pelé's Santos team, which was considered by some to be the best club team history."]], [[20, 'hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) is one of several different forms of what commonly named chemical agent?', "The chemical formula for hydrogen peroxide is.The liquid in its pure form is not coloured and has a slightly higher viscosity than water.Nonetheless, it is commonly employed as a remedy for safety concerns.The most basic peroxide is hydrogen peroxyde, which has an oxygen-oxygen single bond, and can be utilized as a weak oxidizer, bleaching agent, or disinfectant.Rocketry has utilized high-test peroxide, also known as concentrated hydrogen peroxyde, as a propellant.Hydrogen peroxide is frequently referred to as water with an additional oxygen atom, which can create false expectations regarding its chemical similarity.Pure hydrogen peroxide and its appearance are similar, but if heated to boiling, it will detonate, cause severe contact burns, and can ignite objects.Due to these reasons, it is commonly handled as a dilute solution, with household levels ranging from 3 to 6 percent.S.In Europe, it is somewhat higher.Chemistry is primarily concerned with the unstable nature of its peroxide bond.The estimation of the boiling point of has been made to be 150, considering the structure and properties.Water is approximately 50°C cooler than the temperature at 2° Celsius.The thermal decomposition of hydrogen peroxide at a high temperature can result in explosive reactions.It is possible to safely distill it at lower temperatures and with less pressure.The differences between water and hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solutions are due to the presence of hydrogen bonds.The combination of hydrogen peroxide and water results in an eutectic mixture with a freezing-point depression.Pure water has a melting point of 0 °C, and hydrogen peroxide is 0.At a temperature of 43 °C, the two substances freeze at 50 percent volume and 51 %.The boiling point of the mixtures is lowered in proportion to the average of their boiling points, which is reduced by 1.The temperature measured is 1 °C.At 114 °C, the temperature is reached.This has a boiling point that is 14 °C higher than that of pure water, which is 36.Pure hydrogen peroxide is 2 °C hotter than the other.The nonplanar structure of hydrogen peroxide is characterized by its C2 symmetry.Despite being a single bond, the OO bond in the molecule has an impressive rotational barrier of 2460 cm1 ( 29).The current rating is 45 kJ/mol;The rotational barrier of ethane is 12 in comparison.The current is 5 kJ/mol.Atropisomerism is observed in hydrogen peroxide due to the attraction between the lone pairs of adjacent oxygen atoms, which is believed to be caused by an increased barrier.The molecular structures of gaseous and crystalline differ significantly.The absence of hydrogen bonding in the gaseous state is responsible for this contrast.The space group D'P4121 and the crystals of are tetragonal.Comparing the structural analogues of hydrogen peroxide with water shows that it has HmXxHn bonding arrangements.This series' theoretical boiling point (X = O, N, S) is the highest.Its melting point is quite high, similar to hydrazine and water, but only the hydroxylamine crystallizes more easily, indicating a particularly strong hydrogen bond.Both diphosphane and hydrogen disulfide have weak hydrogen bonds and are in fact very similar to hydrogen peroxide.These analogues are all unstable due to their thermodynamic stability.The analogues exhibit similar distorted structures due to the repulsion between adjacent pairs.The discovery of Discovery Hydrogen peroxide dates back to 1818 when Louis Jacques Thénard treated barium peroxye with nitric acid and created it.Hydrochloric acid was used in an improved version of this process, followed by sulfuric acids to precipitate the resulting barium sulfate byproduct.Thénard's process was employed from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s.The unstable nature of pure hydrogen peroxide was a persistent concern, as early attempts to separate it from the water present during synthesis were unsuccessful.The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was facilitated by the presence of transition-metal salts, which caused this instability.Richard Wolffenstein produced pure hydrogen peroxide by vacuum distillation in 1894, almost 80 years after its discovery."]], [[21, 'what is the second biggest city in the

charred and aged in wooden casks.Whisky is a spirit that is subject to strict regulations worldwide, with various classifications available.The unifying traits of the various classes and types are primarily determined by the process of fermenting grains, distillation, and aging in wooden barrels.Whisky or whiskey is a word that has been anglicized to represent the Classical Gaelic word uisce, which means "water," and is now represented by Irish Gaels.The Latin word for distillation of alcohol was aqua vitae, which means "water of life."This was written in Classical Gaelic as the "water of life".Among the initial English translations of the word were uskebeaghe, usquebaugh, and usqubath, all of which were popular by the 1620s.Whisky and whiskey are frequently spelled in the name and

or personal preferences.Recognize and recognize the spelling, while also recognizing the style or origin of the spirit being described.Generally, it is agreed upon that the correct spelling of an individual\'s name on a label should not be changed while quoting.To recognize the difference, certain writers use terms like " whisk ( e) y \'\' or  Whisky/whiskey" instead.Whisky is the preferred spelling of whiskey in Ireland and the United States, while whisky falls under the same name.The usage in the US has not always been consistent.Until the introduction of newspaper style guides, American writers used both spellings interchangeably from the late eighteenth century to the mid twentieth century.American writers have increasingly embraced the use of whiskey as the standard spelling for aged grain spirits made in the US and whisky for non-American producers since the 1960s.Nevertheless, some significant American brands, such as George Dickel, Maker\'s Mark, and Old Forester (all produced by different companies), use the whisky spelling on their labels, while the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, which are the legal regulations for spirit in the US, also use this spelling.The global recognition of  Scotch whisky is linked to the term "Scotch."It is possible that the Babylonians utilized distillation to produce perfumes and aromatics in Mesopotamia during the 2nd millennium BC, but this information is subject to conflicting interpretations due to disputed evidence.In the 1st century AD, the Greeks in Alexandria created the earliest

claimed that he had the authority to nominate up to five Justices and use the Court's power to discriminate against women, minorities, and social justice.Reagan made a promise during his 1980 campaign to nominate the first female Supreme Court Justice if given the chance, in support of Sandra Day O'Connor.During his initial year in office, he selected Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy left by Justice Potter Stewart's retirement.O'Connor received Senate approval on September 21, 1981, with a 99-0 vote to his approval.The vote was not carried out by Senator Max Baucus (D-MT).In his second term, Reagan appointed William Rehnquist as Chief Justice, succeeding Warren Burger.The confirmation of Rehnquist was largely determined by party lines, suggesting that he had not improved his standing among Senate Democrats since his controversial 1971 appointment.On September 17, 1986, the Senate approved Rehnquist's appointment as Chief Justice with a vote of 65-33.Jake Garn and Barry

ruled from 1491 to 1547, lasted from 21 April 1509 until his death.He was the initial English monarch to rule over Ireland and continued the informal entitlement of English kings to the Kingdom of France.The Tudor dynasty's second monarch was Henry, who succeeded his father, Henry VII.In addition to his six marriages and numerous extramarital affairs, Henry was also involved in a conflict with the Pope by trying to have his marriage to Catherine of Aragon annulled, leading to controversy.Due to his disagreements with the Pope, Henry separated the Church of England from papal authority, recognizing himself as the king and Supreme Head of the newly created Church;The disagreements also brought about the dissolution of the Monasteries.His primary focus was on papal power rather than doctrinal matters, and he continued to adhere to fundamental Catholic theological principles despite being excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church.Henry was responsible for the legal connection between England and Wales, which was established through the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542.His long-standing personal rivalry with Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V made him a well-known figure.The English Constitution was radicalized by Henry, who introduced the concept of the divine right of kings to England.The English Reformation was initiated by his efforts to assert the sovereign's authority over the Church of England, which led to a significant expansion of royal power.Accused of treason and heresy, the accused were often executed without a formal trial through attainder bills to suppress dissent.His political objectives were achieved through the efforts of his top ministers, some of whom were expelled or executed after losing their favor.Thomas Wolsey, Thomas More, and several other notable individuals were part of Henry's administration.He was a lavish spender who used the proceeds from the Dissolution of the Monasteries and Reformation Parliament's actions to convert money into royal revenue that had previously been paid to Rome.Despite the financial gains from these sources, Henry was constantly at risk due to his personal wealth and costly wars abroad.Contemporaries regarded Henry as an attractive, educated and successful monarch during his prime, and he was considered one of the most charismatic leaders to hold the English royal title.He not only governed with great power, but he also wrote and composed music.He was motivated by both personal vanity and concern for the stability of Tudor power and peace after the Wars of the Roses, as he wanted to provide England with a male heir.Henry's most enduring memory is his six marriages and separation from the Pope, who refused to annul his first marriage.Henry's health suffered a decline and became severely obese as he aged, ultimately contributing to his death in 1547.His later years were often depicted as a lustful, self-centered, aggressive, and insecure ruler.His successor, Edward VI, took his place.Henry Tudor, the second son and third child of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, was born in Greenwich, London on June 28, 1491 at the Palace of Placentia.Arthur, the Prince of Wales, and three other siblings were part of Henry's young family.Margaret;.Mary managed to survive her infancy.The Bishop of Exeter, Richard Fox, baptized him at the Observant Franciscans church near the palace.At the age of two, Henry was appointed as a Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1493.At the age of three, he was appointed as Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and shortly after was inducted into the Order of the Bath.The day after the ceremony, he was made Duke of York and then appointed as Warden of the Scottish Marches within a month."]], [[26, 'who is said to have gained enlightenment sitting under the bodhi tree?', 'In the Western world, the 19th century translations of Max Müller popularized the term enlightenment, which is roughly translated as bodhi or "awakening" in English.It is characterized by the western interpretation of a sudden perception of an eternal truth.The term is being used to translate other Buddhist terms and concepts that signify insight, such as prajna, kensho, and satori.Knowledge (vidhya)The emergence of peaceful emotions and desires through Nirvana, followed by liberation or release (vimutti);Gautama Buddha exemplified the attainment of Buddhahood.The exact nature of the Buddha\'s awakening is uncertain.It is likely that the realization of liberation was achieved through the combination of mindfulness and dhyani, which enabled them to comprehend arising and avoid cravings.Buddhism\'s study centers on the connection between dhyana and insight, which is a fundamental aspect of their practice.The concept of (spiritual) enlightenment has become more romantic in the western world.The term has become synonymous with self-realization and the identification of one\'s true self, as it is now seen as a substantial essence that is being passed down through social conditioning.The translation is by Robert S.According to Cohen, the majority of English books on Buddhism use the term  enlightenment\'s meaning to refer to the process of translating the word bodhi.Both bodhi and Buddha have the same root, which means "to awaken" or "recover consciousness."According to Cohen, bodhi is not the outcome of illumination, but rather the path towards realization or comprehension.While  enlightenment is focused on events, a more process-oriented term like \'awakening\'\' is associated with the same focus.In the West, the phrase "to enlighten" has its roots in Christianity, as evidenced by Calvin\'s belief that it is only God who enables us to understand his truths.In the early 1800s, bodhi was translated as "intelligence."The term \'enlightenment\' was first used in an English translation of a French article in 1835, and it is credited by the Oxford English Dictionary as the first recorded use of the term.The Times coined the term  the Enlightened\'\' for the Buddha in a brief article published in 1857, which was later reprinted by Max Müller.Subsequently, the usage of the term decreased, but it resurfaced with the publication of Max Müller\'s Chips from a german Workshop, which featured supplementary material from the Times-article.In 1969, the book was converted into German and titled " der Erleuchtete \'\'.Max Müller was an essentialist who believed in a natural religion and saw it as an inherent ability of humanity.The Enlightenment was a method of comprehending natural religious truths, rather than mere myths.In the mid-1870s, it became customary to use the term " enlightened" when talking about the Buddha, and by the late 1880s in English literature, the terms "Enlightence" and "Spiritual Enlightenment" had become the most commonly used.The term Insight Bodhi, which comes from the verbal root Budd (from Sanskrit and Pli), means "to have been awakened and understood," based on the word "buddhism."Tillman Vetter and K. were mentioned by Johannes Bronkhorst.The R.At first, the name Norman did not appear as bodhi.K.The R.Norman suggests that bodhi may have been related to the attainment of nibbana through dhyana practices.Initially, only  prajna was mentioned, and Tillman Vetter suggests that dhyana was considered a source of liberation, with the stilling of pain during the fourth jhana.Gombrich contends that the emphasis on understanding is a later development.Theravada Buddhism refers to the attainment of Arahant status and the accomplishment of the four stages of enlightenment, which is known as bodhi.In Theravada Buddhism, bodhi signifies the attainment of supreme insight and the realization of the four noble truths that lead to deliverance.']], [[27, 'tina turner highway, tennessee, links brownsville and which town?', "The Tennessee city of Brownsville is situated in

is a vast body of saltwater that is either completely or partially enclosed by land.The sea, in broader terms, refers to the interconnected network of oceanic waters on Earth, which can be classified as a single global ocean or multiple major ocean divisions.The sea plays a crucial role in managing Earth's climate and is also involved in the carbon, water, and nitrogen cycles.Although the sea has been explored and travelled since prehistoric times, oceanography is now a significant part of modern scientific study, dating back to the British Challenger expedition in the 1870s.The sea is typically split into up to five major oceanic regions, which include the four named by the IHO (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; this classification allows for multiple ocean types.The Mediterranean is one of the smaller, second-order sections that are referred to as seas.The Northern Hemisphere has a fairly equal land-to-water ratio of 2:3, but the South is

per cent.The mass percentage may vary depending on the situation, such as in landlocked waters, near major rivers' mouths, or at deep water.Approximately 85 percent of the solids found in the open ocean are made up of sodium chloride.The formation of deep-sea currents is attributed to variations in salinity and temperature.Surface currents are created through the friction between wind and tides, as well as the local sea level changes due to the gravity of the Moon and Sun.The Coriolis effect and the Earth's rotation are responsible for directing the movement of surface and submarine land masses.Submerged shallow areas in the sea are known as continental shelves, which were left behind by past sea level fluctuations.Humans rely on the abundant nutrients in these fertile waters, which contain fish, shellfish, mammals, and seaweed that are both harvested from their wild origins and raised for consumption.The most diverse regions encircle exceptional tropical coral reefs.Whales were once abundant in the deep sea, but their numbers have decreased, leading to international conservation efforts and a moratorium on commercial hunting.Oceanography has revealed that the ecosystems of oceans are diverse, with nutrients from hydrothermal vents still providing support for life even at high pressures and depths.The origin of life may have occurred in that area, and the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere is often attributed to aquatic microbial mats.Plants and animals evolved in the ocean for the first time.Human trade, travel, mineral extraction, and power generation all rely on the sea.This has made it crucial to warfare and left major cities vulnerable to potential disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to nearby faults;Vigorous tsunami waves;Hurricanes,

assassin is commonly thought to have its roots in the Arabic term Hashshashin, which means Assassin, and shares similar origins with "Hashashiyyin," or hashish.Originating from the Arabic language: ""The Nizari Shia Persians were identified as the group that engaged in warfare against Arab and Persian targets.The Assassins, who were founded by the Persian Hassan-i Sabbah, operated in Iran from the 8th to the 14th centuries in the fortress of Alamut and also had control over the castle of Masyaf in Syria.The group\'s political and religious agenda resulted in the deaths of members of the Persian, Abbasid, Seljuq, and Christian Crusader élite.The notion that assassins were subject to hashish during their murders or indoctrination is widely accepted, but there is disagreement over the validity of these claims. Many Eastern authors and Western scholars argue that drug use was not the primary factor in the name.William Shakespeare\'s Macbeth, written in 1605, is the first known instance of using the term assassination.The root word for murder in various Romance languages is derived from the Spanish asesinato.The use of assassination as a tool for power politics dates back to the medieval period and is one of the oldest known examples.The origin of it goes back at least as far as recorded history.The Old Testament narrative Judith portrays a woman who deceives and eliminates Holofernes, despite the Israelites being at war with the Assyrians.The assassination of King Joash of Judah was reported to have been carried out by his servants;Absalom, the son of King David, was killed by Joab;King Sennacherib of Assyria was killed by his own sons.The person known as Chanakya (c.).He wrote about assassinations in great detail in his political treatise Arthashastra, which was published between

of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great, and Julius Caesar, who served as Roman consul in 44 BC, are among the well-known victims.The death of Emperors of Rome and many other Shia Imams occurred in this manner hundreds of years after their deaths.Ancient China had a well-known practice of this kind, as evidenced by the unsuccessful assassination of Qin king Ying Zheng by Jing Ke in 227 BC.Although the majority of assassination attempts were carried out by one person or a small group, there were also groups that utilized multiple individuals to carry out different killings.The

was uncommon in Western Europe during the Middle Ages.The most prevalent methods of punishment were blinding and strangulation in the bath.Tyrannical or political assassinations began to occur again in Western Europe during the Renaissance.High medieval sources mention the assassination of King Demetrius Zvonimir (historically recorded) by his own people, who opposed the Pope\'s proposal to launch a military campaign against the Seljuk Turks.Historians hold differing opinions on this account, with the majority of those who follow it believing that he died of natural causes.The legend of the assassination of King Zvonimir is the basis for the mythical tale of his curse.In 1192, an assassin killed Conrad of Montferrat, who was the de facto ruler of Jerusalem.']], [[30, 'canaletto is

He was born on September 28, 1888 and died on August 14, 1937.C.Sapper, a British soldier and author, was also known as McNeile.After spending time in the trenches during World War I, he began writing short stories and having them published by the Daily Mail.Lord Northcliffe, the owner of the Daily Mail, decided to give him the pen name  Sapper's because serving officers in the British Army were not allowed to publish their own names.His Royal Engineers were the source of the nickname.Despite transitioning from war stories to thrillers, McNeile continued to write after the war.The publication of Bulldog Drummond in 1920 by him resulted in the creation of his most famous work, which was dedicated to the hero.The character was based on McNeile, Fairlie, and English gentlemen as a whole.McNeile authored ten novels on the Bulldog Drummond theme, three plays, and a screenplay.McNeile merged the Drummond work with other novels and story collections that featured Jim Maitland and Ronald Standish, two protagonists in their own works.His authorship during the inter-war period saw him as one of the most successful British popular authors, until his death in 1937 from throat cancer, which was attributed to damage caused by a gas attack during that conflict.The stories behind McNeile are either directly related to the war or include individuals whose lives have been affected by it.His thrillers follow his war stories, featuring wealthy Englishmen defending England against foreign forces who were planning to invade.He was initially considered a respectable Tory who represented the majority of his fellow citizens, but after World War II, his writings were condemned for their fascist connotations and the anti-Semitic attitudes that some writers had in common.McNeile was born in Bodmin, Cornwall, during his early life.The son of Malcolm McNeile, a Royal Navy captain and the governor of Bodmin, and Christiana Mary (née Sloggett) was born.The McNeile family had connections to Belfast and Scotland, and one of their members was a general who served in the British Indian Army.Although McNeile was known as Mac to his friends, he preferred to be called Cyril instead of either of the two names.He attended a prep school in Eastbourne and later received additional education at Cheltenham College.He enrolled in the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, upon leaving the college and was subsequently promoted to second lieutenant in July 1907 with the rank of Royal Engineers.He received additional training at the Royal School of Military Engineering before being posted briefly to Aldershot Garrison.He was commissioned as a lieutenant in June 1910 and served with the 3rd Field Troop for three years until January 1914, when he was posted in Malta.In 1914, McNeile was elevated to the position of captain.In October 1914, he was sent to France while still in Malta;On 31 October 1914, he tied the knot with Violet Evelyn Baird and journeyed through England.Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Baird Douglas of the Cameron Highlanders was the father of Bai R.The British Expeditionary Force deployed McNeile to France on 2 November 1914 for the First World War.The destruction of McNeile's records by incendiary bombs during the Second World War has left little information about his service during that time.He was stationed with a variety of Royal Engineer units on the Western Front, including 1st Field Squadron RE, 15th Field Company RE and RE components of the 33rd Division.Reminiscences of Sergeant Michael Cassidy, McNeile's first known published story, was serialised in the Daily Mail on page four from 13 January 1915.The British Army's policy of not publishing under their own names except during their half-pay sabbaticals led many serving officers to use a pseudonym to write.Due to the Royal Engineers being known as the Sappers, Lord Northcliffe, who owned the Daily Mail, gave McNeile the pen name  Sapper's."]], [[35, 'what is the traditional maori greeting in which people press noses together?', "The customary way of greeting people in New Zealand is through a hongi.One can achieve this by pressing their nose and forehead

contract to create ten comedy shows, signifying their break from their previous association with comedian Tony Hancock, who had previously written his book entitled Half Hour.Due to financial

taking turns at each time.The ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th centuries AD, served as inspiration for their creation.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was created in 1894 by Baron Pierre de Coubertin.The Olympic Movement\'s governance is under the purview of the IOC, with the Charter defining its structure and authority.The Olympic Games have undergone several modifications due to the evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries.Among the changes are the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games to be free of disability, and the Youth Olympic games for teenage athletes.The IOC has been compelled to adjust to various economic, political, and technological shifts.The Olympics have shifted their focus from pure amateurism, as Coubertin predicted, to professional athletes.The rise in mass media attention resulted in the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games.The 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games were all cancelled due to the outbreak of World Wars.Participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games was restricted due to significant boycotts during the Cold War.The Olympic Movement is composed of international sports federations, IFs, NOCs and organizing committees for specific Olympic Games.The IOC is in charge of selecting the host city for each Games and is responsible for organizing and funding them in accordance with the Olympic Charter.The IOC is responsible for determining the Olympic program, which includes the sports that will be played during the Games.The Olympic flag, torch, opening ceremony, and closing ceremony are just a few examples of the many rituals and symbols that make up the Games.The Summer and Winter Olympic Games have 33 sports and almost 400 events in which more than 13,000 athletes compete.Olympic medals are awarded to the first-place finisher, who finishes in bronze, silver, and third place.The Games have grown to the point where almost every nation is now represented.The expansion has resulted in various issues and controversies, such as boycotts, doping, corruption, and even a terrorist attack in 1972.Every two years, the Olympics and its media coverage provide unknown athletes with the opportunity to achieve national and sometimes international recognition.The host city and country can showcase their skills and abilities to the world during the Games.The Ancient Olympic Games were held at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece, every four years, and they included religious and athletic celebrations.The representatives of various city-states and kingdoms in Ancient Greece vied for supremacy.The Games incorporated both athletic and combat sports, including wrestling, pankration, horse and chariot racing events.The Games were marked by a postponement of any conflicts between the participating city-states until they were resolved, according to many accounts.The Olympic peace or truce was the name given to the cessation of hostilities.The Greeks\' inability to cease their wars has made this idea a modern myth.The truce granted religious pilgrims traveling to Olympia the liberty to pass through the warring regions without fear as they were safeguarded by Zeus.The origins of the Olympics are both enigmatic and mythical;The Games\' ancestor is believed to be Heracles and his father Zeus, according to one of the most popular myths.The legend has it that Heracles was the first to refer to the Games as "Olympic" and established the tradition of holding them

the reign of James I in 1603.The Stuart administration was embroiled in a civil war that ended with the assassination of Charles I in 1649.The monarchy made a comeback in 1660, but the Civil War established that an English monarch cannot govern without the consent of Parliament, which was legally confirmed only after the Glorious Revolution of 1688.The United Kingdom and the kingdom of England functioned as a constitutional monarchy from that point.Despite being considered uncodified, the Constitution of the United Kingdom is based on the Bill of Rights 1689.The Kingdom of Great

as wine, beer, and distilled spirits, can cause various unpleasant physiological and psychological effects, leading to a hangover.The duration of a hangover can be as long as several hours or more than 24 hours.The typical signs of a hangover include headaches, sleepiness, poor concentration, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, and digestive issues.The g.The symptoms include vomiting, lack of sustenance, sweating, nausea, hyper-excitability, and anxiety.The reasons behind a hangover are still unclear, but there are several factors implicated in the condition, including acetaldehyde, immune system changes, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, prostaglandin synthesis, cardiac output, vasodilation levels, sleep deprivation and malnutrition.Alcoholic beverages contain additives or by-products that have a specific effect on the beverage.The effects of alcohol-induced intoxication usually subside in the morning after a night of heavy drinking.Despite the availability of various remedies and folk remedies, there is no conclusive evidence to support the effectiveness of any of them in preventing or treating alcohol-related hangovers.Avoiding alcohol or consuming it in moderation is the best approach to prevent a hangover.Workplace absenteeism, impaired work performance, reduced productivity, and poor academic performance are among the health risks associated with alcohol hangovers that have socioeconomic implications.A hangover can hinder the ability to engage in potentially hazardous daily activities, such as operating heavy machinery or driving a car.Signs and symptoms of an alcohol hangover include drowsiness, headaches, concentration issues, dry mouth, dizziness, digestive problems, fatigue, sweating, nausea, hyperexcitability, anxiety, and a sense of discomfort that may persist for more than 1-2 days.Alcohol hangover symptoms occur when blood alcohol concentration drops significantly and then reaches a peak at almost zero.The effects of hangovers, as confirmed by controlled studies, include general symptoms such as malaise, thirst, headache, dizziness, tiredness and loss of appetite, nausea, stomach ache, and the sensation of heart racing.Changes in sleep patterns and gastrointestinal distress are among the direct effects of alcohol intoxication, which can cause withdrawal symptoms.Drowsiness and impaired cognitive function are the most common symptoms of alcohol hangover.The causes of hangovers are still not fully understood.The occurrence of alcohol hangover is caused by various pathophysiological changes, such as increased levels of acetaldehyde, hormonal changes in cytokine pathways, and reduced glucose availability.Other related phenomena include dehydration, metabolic acidosis, disruption of prostaglandin synthesis, increased cardiac output, vasodilator, sleep deprivation and insufficient eating.Alcoholic congeners, which are complex organic molecules, can contribute significantly to hangover effects by metabolizing highly toxic formaldehyde and formic acid.The pathophysiology of ethanol consumption involves the conversion of esterified ion channels into acetaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase and then oxidation into alpha-1/0.These reactions also alter the synthesis of NAD+ adenine dinucleotide.In a redox reaction, NADH is converted into its reduced form.The imbalance in NAD+ levels was caused by it.The redox system of NADH and alcohol-containing beverages make it more difficult to function normally.The human body experiences a range of redox changes, including increased triglyceride production, increased amino acid catabolism, citric acid cycle inhibition, lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis in the hypothalamus, hyperuricemia, disturbance of cortisol and androgen metabolism, and increased fibrinogenesis.Insulin and glucose metabolism are also impacted.Recent studies have found no significant differences between the concentration of different hormones, electrolytes, free fatty acids, triglycerides, lactate, ketones, cortisol, and glucose in blood or urine samples and demonstrated an associated decrease in hangover symptoms.The CYP2E1 enzyme is stimulated by alcohol, which converts ethanol and other substances into more reactive toxins.During binge drinking, the enzyme activation leads to oxidative stress, which can cause cell death.The acetaldehyde, the primary product of ethanol, is 10 to 30 times more poisonous than alcohol and can persist at a high level for several hours after initial consumption.']], [[48, 'what formal menswear, often abbreviated to three letters,

costume has been relegated to specific meanings like fancy dress or masquerade wear, as the more technical term is often associated with the study of clothing.Fashion can be characterized by both masculine and feminine characteristics, but some styles are more accurately described as androgynous.The lack of change in clothing styles was a common observation made by early Western visitors, particularly those traveling to places like Persia, Turkey, India, and China.During a Spanish visit in 1609, the Japanese Shogun's secretary boasted that Japanese clothing had not changed for over 2,000 years.Despite this, there is ample proof in Ming China of swiftly evolving fashion trends in Chinese attire.During periods of economic or social change, such as ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate, changes in clothing frequently occurred, but no significant changes were observed for an extended period.In Moorish Spain during the 8th century, Ziryab, a musician, introduced sophisticated clothing-styles to Córdoba that were inspired by his hometown of Baghdad and tailored to seasonal and daily styles.The Middle East experienced comparable fashion shifts in the 11th century when Turks arrived, introducing clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East.Europe's history of a continuous and swiftly evolving fashion revolution can be traced back to earlier times.Western clothing has its origins in the middle of the 14th century, as recorded by historians like James Laver and Fernand Braudel.A significant change in fashion during the early stages of development was the abrupt reduction and tightening of male over-garments, which went from being calf-length to just covering the buttocks, and sometimes included stuffing in the chest to make them appear bigger.The creation of a tailored top worn with leggings or trousers gave rise to the distinctive Western appearance.The next century witnessed a significant acceleration in change, with both genders experiencing equally intricate fashion trends, particularly in hair dressing and styling.By using fashion with precision and confidence, art historians can date images within five years, often including those from the 15th century.The upper classes in Europe were divided by changes in fashion, which resulted in the emergence of unique national styles.The national styles were markedly different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries, which enforced similar styles, mostly originating from Ancien Régime France.Despite the fact that wealthy individuals were typically the most influential in fashion, the rise of wealth in early modern Europe resulted in the bourgeoisie and peasants adopting trends that were still not easily achievable by the elites.National differences were at their highest level in the 16th century.Ten portraits from the 16th century of German or Italian men may feature ten distinct headwear.At the end of the 15th century, Albrecht Dürer exhibited the differences between Nuremberg and Venetian fashions.Spanish style in the late 16th century initiated a return to harmony among upper class Europeans, and French styles took over leadership after ten years. This process was completed in 18th-century England.Although the colors and patterns of textiles changed from one year to another, the pattern that women wore in their dresses slowly evolved over time.Men's attire was largely influenced by military models, and the European male Silhouette underwent changes in wartime settings where gentleman officers could document foreign styles like the cravat or necktie."]], [[49, "which hit for 'wet wet wet' was the biggest-selling single in britain in 1994?", 'The Official Charts Company compiles a list of music charts, including the UK Singles Chart, that determine the top-selling singles in the United Kingdom throughout the week.Prior to 2004, the chart solely relied on the sales of physical singles, with airplay and digital downloads not included in the official chart.The list includes songs that reached the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart in 1994, as well as those that peaked in 1993 and 1995 but were not part of it.The entry date signifies the first time the song made it to the top 10.In 1994, the top ten included 131 singles.In 1994, three of the top ten were made by American singer Mariah Carey, East 17 and British boy-band Take That.The song  Without You\'s cover by Carey was the most popular hit of the year;The team\'s ranking surged in February, and it held that position for four weeks before moving up to the top 10 eight times overall.

They also react with bases and some metals to form salts.The term acid is derived from the Latin word acidus/acre, which means sour.When an acidic solution has a pH below 7 and is considered "acid" or "dissolved in acid," the accurate definition pertains to the dissolved molecule, not the purified substance.The pH of a solution is directly proportional to its acidity, leading to an increase in positive hydrogen ion concentration.Acidity is a characteristic of chemical or substance properties.Examples of aqueous acids are hydrochloric acid, acetic acid (a dilute solution of hydrogen chloride found in gastric acid and activated digestive enzymes), sulfuric Acid (used in car batteries), and Citric Acid present in citrus fruits.These examples demonstrate that acids can be solids, liquids or

acids are not like Arrhenius or Brnsted-Lowry acids.The term Brnsted acid is used in modern terminology to describe an acid, as it is not explicitly referred too often to Lewis acid.Modern definitions focus on the fundamental chemical reactions that occur in all acids.Arrhenius and Brnsted-Lowry definitions are the most pertinent because acids in everyday life are typically found in aqueous

Additionally, He succeeded in partitioning Ireland between Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland.He was the final Liberal to hold the position of Prime Minister.The coalition\'s premiership was largely supported by the Conservatives in parliament, not by his Liberal counterparts.The party\'s failure as a major political force was partly due to the Liberal split, which had lingering effects.He became the leader of the Liberal Party in the late 1920s, but his return to power was unsuccessful, and by the 1930s he was a marginalized figure that was widely unpopular.A survey of 139 academics conducted by MORI ranked him as the third greatest prime minister of the 20th century, and he was included in the list of 100 Greatest Britons in 2002.Lloyd George was born to Welsh parents in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester, and spent his childhood growing up as a Welsh speaker.Until now, he is the only British Prime Minister who has been fluent in Welsh and spoke English as a second language.William George, the father of the individual, had worked as a teacher in London and Liverpool.The Unitarians administered the Hope Street Sunday Schools, where he met Dr James Martineau, and taught there.Due to his ill health, William George returned to Pembrokeshire with his family in March of that year.Despite starting farming, he died in June 1864 due to pneumonia at the age of 44.Following Elizabeth George\'s sale of the farm, she and her children relocated to Llanystumdwy in Caernarfonshire.

assist the common people while disadvantaging the nobility.John Grigg, the biographer of Lloyd George, contended that his upbringing in a destitution-ridden household was far from overshadowed by his uncle\'s position of authority and respectability in his small town.Despite being brought up as a devout evangelical, he unexpectedly lost his religious convictions.Biographer Don Cregier claims that he became both Deist and agnostic while remaining dedicated to chapel worship and adept at receiving good preaching.He refrained from discussing that matter, but was regarded as a prominent warrior in the Welsh Nonconformity.Lloyd George became interested in land ownership during this period of his life.']], [[53, 'the white wine, chablis, originates from which wine producing region of france?', 'Chablis is the wine district that lies to the north of the Burgundy region in France.The wines produced in this cooler climate are more acidic and less fruity than Chardonnay wines grown in warmer regions.The wine is commonly identified by its  flinty flavor, which can be described as a "gilded taste of pierre" or "hazy taste."Chardonnay grapes must be labeled with the Chablis Appellation d\'origine contrôlée.The dry white wine produced by the grapevines in Chablis town is famous for its unadulterated flavor and taste.The oak flavor is less pronounced in Chablis wine than in the other Burgundy white wines.The majority of Chablis are uncomplicated and preserved in stainless steel vessels.Chablis producers exhibit a wide range of stylistic preferences regarding the amount of barrel maturation, whether or not.While many Grand Cru and Premier Cru wines mature in oak barrels, the amount of time spent in them and the proportion of new barrel used are typically much lower than those used for white wines from Côte de Beaune.Located in the Yonne department, Chablis is situated approximately 10 miles east of Auxerre, and is roughly halfway between Paris and the Côte d\'Or.The wine-growing regions of Champagne and Alsace are the only ones in France with a northern location.The southern Aube district in Champagne is closer to Chablis than to the rest of Burgundy.27 communes are spread out along the Serein river, covering an area of 15 km x 20 km.The Cretaceous period is attributed to the presence of chalk layers on the Kimmeridge clay soil, which also includes outcrops that extend from Sancerre to Dover.The Grand Crus, which are the finest vineyards in the region, are situated on a small hillside facing southwest and just north of Chablis town.Vieticulture in the region was largely driven by the Cistercian monks and Catholic Church during the Middle Ages, who played a significant role in shaping the area\'s economy and commerce.The monks grew vines along the Serein, which were established at Pontigny Abbey in 1114.The Abbey received a vineyard from Anséric de Montréal in Chablis in 1186.A Chablis wine was described by Salimbene di Adam, a chronicler, in 1245.It is believed that Chardonnay was first planted in Chablis by the Cistercians of Pontigny Abbey in the 12th century, and it then spread to the rest of Burgundy.The Duchy of Burgundy incorporated the Chablis region in the 15th century.In the mid-15th century, there were records indicating that Chablis wine was transported to England, Flanders, and Picardy.The Huguenots destroyed the town in February 1568, and it wasn\'t until the 18th century that the area truly regained its footing.The French Revolution, the Little Ice Age, and Prussian invasions were all triggered by the aftermath.The vineyards were first affected by oidium and the phylloxera outbreak in the 1880s while they were being rebuilt.The Chablis wine industry\'s recovery was delayed until the latter half of the 20th century, following two World Wars.The Seine\'s accessibility to the Yonne river allowed Chablis wine producers to have a near monopoly on the profitable Parisian market.The English were introduced to wine in large quantities during the 17th century.The 19th century saw the planting of nearly 98840 acres of vines in Chablis, with vineyards stretching from Chablales to Joigny and Sens along the Yonne.Chablis wines were spotted in various regions of northern France, and some Champagne producers even used them as a base for their sparkling cuvee.Leo Tolstoy\'s Anna Karenina from the 19th century features a common reference to classic Chablis.The late 1800s marked a time of disaster for the area, beginning with the establishment of railway lines that linked all regions of the nation to Paris in the 1850s.Chablis\' market share in Paris was diminished by the influx of affordable wine from Midwestern regions, such as the Languedoc.During the 1880s, both powdery mildew and phylloxera caused devastation in vineyards.']], [[54, 'sergio leone, otto preminger, fritz lang and fred zinnemann are famous 20thc?', "From 1907 to 1997, Alfred  Fred '' Zinnemann, an American film director, was born in Austria and passed away on March 14, 1997.He has been the recipient of four Academy Awards for his work on thrillers, westerns and film noir, as well as other genres such as play adaptations.His 50-year career saw him create 25 feature films.To achieve greater authenticity in his movies, he was among the first filmmakers to emphasize the use of authentic locations and the inclusion of celebrities alongside civilian actors.In the movie business, he was seen as a daring actor who could create original stories and dramas that pitted lone and principled actors against the odds of tragedy.According to a historian, Zinnemann's style showcased his commitment to creating worthwhile pictures that were still highly amusing.The Men (1950), High Noon ( 1952), and From Here to Eternity ( 1953) were some of his most notable films.The movies that were screened include The Nun's Story (1955), A Man For All Seasons (1966), The Day of the Jackal (1973), and Julia (1974).His movies have garnered 65 Oscar nominations, with 24 of them being won.A number of stars were introduced and directed by Zinnemann in their U.S.S.The film debut lineup features Marlon Brando, Rod Steiger, Pier Angeli, Julie Harris, Brandon deWilde, Montgomery Clift, Shirley Jones, and Meryl Streep.The 19 Oscar-nominated actors he directed were: Frank Sinatra, Montgomery Clift, Audrey Hepburn, Glynis Johns, Paul Scofield, Robert Shaw, Wendy Hiller, Jason Robards; Vanessa Redgrave; Jane Fonda; Gary Cooper and Maximilian Schell.The birthplace of Zinnemann was Rzeszów in Poland, which was part of Austria-Hungary during his early years. He was the offspring of Anna ( Feiwel) and Oskar Zernemann, a doctor.He was born into a Jewish family and had one younger sibling.While growing up in Austria, he pursued his passion for music and eventually graduated from the University of Vienna with a law degree in 1927.During his time as a law student, he became fascinated by films and convinced his parents to allow him to pursue film production in Paris.Having studied at the Ecole Technique de Photographie et Cinématographie in Paris for a year, he transitioned into directing roles as 'cameraman' and worked on multiple films in Berlin before moving to Hollywood.The Holocaust claimed the lives of both of his parents.Following his study of filmmaking in France, Zinnemann and a group of beginners, including Billy Wilder and Robert Siodmak, worked together to produce People on Sunday in Germany during their early career as directors.One of the earliest examples of social realism in narrative films is The Wave ( 1935), his first feature film, which was shot on location in Mexico and featured mostly amateur actors from local communities.According to Zinnemann, his collaboration with Robert Flaherty, a documentarian filmmaker, was probably the most significant influence on his work.Despite his admiration for the arts in Germany, he was aware of the country's severe economic situation during World War II.He became disenchanted with Berlin due to the constant presence of decadent ostentation, luxury, and desperate unemployment.Wealthy groups were increasingly relocating to the political right, while the poor were gravitating towards the left.Emotion had already taken over the role of reason, as he stated.Film production in Europe experienced a significant decrease due to the changing political environment and the unpreparedness of the country for producing sound films.At the age of 21, Zinnemann was given permission by his parents to move to America and pursue filmmaking opportunities.In October 1929, he arrived in New York during the stock market crash."]], [[55, 'the lead singer of which band is known as suggs?', 'Suggs, an English singer-songwriter, musician, radio personality, and actor, was born on 13 January 1961.Suggs rose to prominence in the late 1970s as the lead vocalist for Madness, a British ska band that released fifteen singles that reached the top ten of the UK charts during the 1970\'s, 1980s and 1990s.In 1995, Suggs started his solo career as a member of Madness while still associated with the show.He has released two studio albums and two compilation albums since then. I\'m Only Sleeping, a popular song with local audiences, and the albums Camden Town and Cecilia feature among his solo performances.Suggs has experience as an actor in the film, theatre, and television industries.Two children are his offspring, and he has been married once.The son of William Rutherford McPherson, who lived from 1935 to 1975, and jazz singer Edith Gower, was born in Hastings, Sussex, England on 13 January 1961.Suggs was brought up in Hastings by his mother, and the couple got married in Paddington in 1960.When Suggs was three, his father had already left.The father\'s story in a 2009 interview yielded no answers except for the mention of heroin, paraffin injections, and segregation.He is presumed to have passed away at this point.Wouldn\'t it have been possible for him to contact you if he were still alive?The poor bugger must have passed away.Suggs was raised in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, for three years, and his mother moved to North London after he began attending a grammar school.He enrolled in a comprehensive school located in North London\'s Swiss Cottage, at Quintin Kynaston.He has revealed on the Madness official website that he was born in Hastings on a stormy evening on 13 January 1961.Being in my mother\'s house meant that we were both free agents.She performed in pubs and clubs as a singer.We transferred to Liverpool and subsequently London.I spent some time living with friends in Wales before returning to London.Being an only child meant that I was isolated and had a lot of stubbornness.The upheaval in my studies made me unproductive, resulting in me being at Quintin Kynaston school in St John\'s Wood for most of my education. I chose to remain in the sixth form for social security reasons and eventually completed two O-levels before pursuing a CSE.I came across Mike Barson while at Hampstead School.During his school years,

daikon?', "Raphanus sativus, or the radish, is an edible root vegetable belonging to the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe before the arrival of humans.Across the globe, radishes are grown and consumed as food, with most people consuming them in their raw form as a delicious salad green.There are many varieties, with varying sizes, flavors, hues, and durations of maturation.The sharp taste of radiushes is due to the production of various chemical compounds by plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate.In certain situations, they are grown as companion plants with minimal pests or diseases.The growth and germination rate of daikons are rapid, with smaller varieties being ready for consumption in a month, while larger ones require several months.The use of radish can be as a catch crop or as cover crop during winter, or it can also be used as food for various other purposes.The seeds of certain radishes are utilized in their cultivation;The cultivation of daikon can be used to produce oil.Both roots and leaves are served cold or cooked, while others are used for sprouting.The early history and domestication of radish varieties are not well-documented in archeological records, despite their widespread distribution across the globe.Scientists are making tentative attempts to locate the origin of Raphanus sativus in southeast Asia, as it is the only location where truly wild forms have been discovered.It seems that India, central China, and central Asia were secondary hubs where distinct forms were developed.The historical record is enriched by the presence of radishes.Agriculturalists from Greece and Rome documented different types of crops, such as small, large, round, long, mild, and sharp.It is believed that the radish was among the first crops brought to the Americas by Europeans.In 1544, a botanist from Germany documented the appearance of 100 lb radishes that were about 3 ft in length, but today, only the Sakurajima radish is known to exist.The oversized, mild, and white East Asian shape was first developed in China, but it is commonly associated with the Japanese daikon in the West due to Japan's agricultural progress and increased exports.The radishes are brassicaceous plants that have annual or biennial growth and their distinctive tap roots, which can be either globular, tapering, or cylindrical.The skin colour on the roots is a mixture of white, pink, red, purple, yellow, green, and black, but the flesh is typically white.In the smaller species, there are a few leaves that measure approximately 13 cm in length and have round roots that can be either 1-inch or 2-inch in diameter or more slender, with long roots reaching up to 7 cm.Typically, both of these are consumed in salads without cooking.The longer root form, which includes oriental radishes, daikon or mooli, and winter radish, grows up to 60 cm in length, while the foliage is about 60cm high with a 45c spread.When radishes are harvested at a timely time, their flesh is crisp and sweet, but if left unharvested for an extended period, the meat becomes tough and bitter.The leaves are placed in a rosette arrangement.The lyrate shape of these creatures implies that they are split in a pinnate manner, with an amplified terminal lobe and smaller lateral limbs.The white flowers are borne by the racemose inflorescence.The fruits are small pods that can be eaten as a youngster.With 18 chromosomes (2n=18), the radish is a diploid species.Radishes are a fast-growing crop that grows well in the cool climate and every year.The seed takes three to four days to germinate in a humid environment with soil temperatures around 65 to.The best quality of roots can be obtained during moderate day lengths and with air temperatures that fall within the 50s to 50.In normal conditions, the crop can take 1-3 weeks to mature, but in colder weather, it may require up to 7 weeks.Full sun, sandy soil, and pH 6 are the ideal environments for radishes to thrive.From 5 to 7,For late-season crops, a clayey-loam is the perfect option.Unsuitable soils that bake dry and form a crust in dry weather can hinder germination.Repeat plantings that are a week or two apart can lengthen the harvesting periods.During the autumn season, radishes are typically planted in warmer regions.The root size is influenced by the depth of the seed, which can range from 1 cm for small radishes to 4 cm deep for larger radish."]], [[57, 'the recreation ground, kingsholm stadium and the memorial ground are all english venues

are crossbreeds or designer dogs have been intentionally bred from recognized dog breeds and not from purebreasted dogs without any artificial breeding to be considered true crosses.The Encyclopdia Britannica has dated the term "designer dog" to the late 20th century, when breeders used to crossbreeds from purebred poodles and other purebroken dogs with desirable traits.A designer dog crossbreeds are identified by a portmanteau word that is made up of the sounds and syllables of their parents, like Schnoodle.Designer dogs are being crossed with other purebred breeds to offer an endless selection of labels, such as the Puggle (a cross between a Pug and Beagle) that can be used in various combinations.This approach has led to the labeling of crossbreeds with diverse ancestral backgrounds, like German Chusky (German Shepherd Dog, Husky, and Chow Coop).Although crossbreeding does not produce a uniform breeding phenotype, some designer dogs with the same breed will have resemblance to each other, much like their siblings in purebred form.The same litter\'s young often exhibit a wide range of physical differences.Designer dogs are typically bred as companions and pets, which is one of their distinguishing features.Portmanteau names are not commonly used to identify working and hunting dogs that were intentionally crossbred for specific purposes;Eurohounds (race sled dogs) and Lurchers are the most frequently used names for these animals, rather than their specific breed.The dogs are considered cross breeds, not designer animals, as their appearance is not the primary factor in their breeding.The Labradoodle, despite its Portmanteau name, is often used as a Guide or Assistance dog and is also popular as family pets.While owners tend to choose designer dogs due to their novelty, reputable breeders may use crossbreeding to minimize the hereditary issues that exist in purebred breeds while still maintaining their desirable traits.In The New York Times, Jon Mooallem suggests that crossing two purebred dogs and expanding their gene pools is a great idea, given the approximately 350 inherited disorders in the dog genome, as suggested by one canine geneticist.Although crossbreeding with dogs has been studied in livestock, there is limited research on the matter.The desired trait being bred, such as a hypoallergenic coat, must be heritable.The heiritability is the measure of the quantifiable variation between animals for a particular trait that can be passed down to future generations.The objectives of crossbreeding dogs and livestock may be more difficult to define than those of dog breeding;Defining and measuring good temperament may be more challenging than high calf weight.Designer dog breeders are frequently criticized for their preference for breeding profitable puppies over improving the health and welfare of dogs.According to Wally Conron\'s response to the introduction of the Labrador cross, did the breeders prioritize checking for heredity issues among their lineage or simply focusing on offering it to hungry individuals?Designer dogs may have a higher price tag than their purebred counterparts.Designer dog enthusiasts argue that modern dog breeds were created by using selective breeding techniques to crossbreed with earlier types of dogs.The Toy Poodle was likely bred to mimic larger poodles through crossbreeding with smaller Bichons like the Maltese and Havanese.Many older dog breeds and types are present in the majority of modern breed ancestries;For information on the breed\'s origin, consult specific breed articles.The health of crossbred dogs is reliant on their being descended from healthy parents.']], [[59, "who won the .1995 best actress oscar for her role as

have fewer than 10 species.Australia has witnessed the reintroduction of the Corvus genus, which includes five species and one subspecies, in recent geological history.The corvid family and its relatives have been the subject of much debate over the precise evolutionary relationships between them, as well as other factors.The realization that corvids originated from Australasian ancestors and then spread to the rest of the world soon emerged.Other lineages that originated from these ancestors developed into ecologically diverse but often Australasian groups.The Corvida was created by Sibley and Ahlquist in the late 1970s and 1980s, where they combined the corvids with other taxa through DNA-DNA hybridization.Currawongs, birds of paradise, whipbirds and quail-thrushes were among the presumed corvid relatives, but recent research suggests that this grouping may be partly false.The Corvoidea is primarily composed of corvids, as well as their closest relatives such as the birds of paradise, Australian mud-nesters, and shrikes.They form the core group of the Corvida, which comprises related groups like orioles and vireos.Cladistic analysis of multiple DNA sequences has helped to clarify the interrelationships between the corvids.The jays and magpies do not form monophyletic lineages, but rather exhibit divergent traits, resulting in an American and Old World lineage, and a Holarctic and Oriental lineagedge.There is no close association between these.Despite its long-standing reputation, the azure-winged magpie's location has become even less evident."]], [[64, 'in what country did the romani ethnic group originate?', 'The Romani is also known as Romany in English.Roma, a nomadic ethnic group, have historically lived in Europe and the Americas. They are originally from the northern regions of the Indian subcontinent, likely from Rajasthan, Haryana, and Punjab.English-speaking individuals frequently refer to the Romani as Gypsies or Gipsies, which is a term that some view as pejorative and has negative connotations of illegality and irregularity.Romani are scattered, with their concentration in Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe, including Turkey, Spain (most of northern Europe), and southern France (northern Africa).Originating from Northern India, they later traveled to Mid-West Asia and Europe, either by means of a lineage similar to that of the Dom people;Between the sixth and eleventh centuries, the forefathers of both the Romani and the Dom departed from North India.Romani have been migrating to the Americas since the 19th century.The United States has an estimated one million Roma people;The majority of the 800,000 individuals in Brazil were descendants of immigrants who migrated from eastern Europe during the 1800s.The population of Brazil includes Romani who are descended from individuals expelled by the Portuguese government during the Inquisition era.Romani have been relocating to other countries in South America and Canada since the late nineteenth century.The Indian Minister of External Affairs declared that Roma people were India\'s children during the International Roma Conference in February 2016.The Indian diaspora is believed to include the Roma community, which is spread out in 30 countries, as recommended by the Indian government at the end of the conference.The Romani language is categorized into different dialects, with an estimated two million or more speakers.At least twice as many people are believed to be Romani, with some estimates suggesting they are several times larger.A significant proportion of Romani are proficient in both the current and previous languages of their native language, as well as a blend of both.Para-Romani is a term used to describe those varieties.They came from the Kingdom of Bohemia, where they received writs of protection from King Sigismund of that kingdom, and their names were exonyms.The French gitan, English gypsy, Spanish gersey, Turkish kipti, and Hungarian faraonépe are all believed to have Egyptian roots.Hungarian gypsies are represented by the following languages: English, French, German, Old Church Slavic (ианин), Italian and Romanian.The word "athinganos" is derived from the Greek term "untouchable."The Arabic translation includes Nawar and Zott.The term Romani Rom to refer to the inhabitants of Byzantium, who were believed to be successors of Ancient Rome, is similar to Sanskrit  (roma) meaning "Rome" and possibly from Greek ecclesiastical philosophy.Manusha, a Sanskrit term for "man," is connected to both German Mensch and English man.In general, Sanskrit\'s word for river or stream of water is  ( sindhu).It specifically refers to the Indus river and its surrounding area, which is commonly referred to as Sindh.The Romani language employs the term Rom as a masculine noun, which can translate to "rom" or "man of the Roma ethnic group", with the plural form being "Rom."The Romani language uses the feminine form of Rom, which is Romni.Rom is now commonly used to refer to individuals of all genders in other languages.Romani is the adjective that represents femininity, whereas Romano is adverbial representation of masculinity.Certain Romanies use Rom or Roma as an ethnic term, while others do not self-ascribe this name to their entire ethnic group, such as the Sinti or Romanichal.There are instances where rom and romani are written with a double r and an i.e.Rrom and rromani.']], [[65, 'what was the name of the cruise liner that capsized near the rocky island of giglio off the tuscan

call.Besides transportation, cruising also involves traveling to and from ports on a specific continent.No ports of call are present on certain  cruises, such as those for 2- or 3-night round trips.Dedicated ocean liners, in contrast, do line voyages and usually transport passengers from one location to another instead of doing a round trip.Traditionally, an ocean liner intended for the transoceanic trade has been constructed to exceed the performance of a typical cruise ship, with high freeboard and stronger plating to ensure it can withstand rough seas and adverse weather conditions in the open ocean, such as the North Atlantic.Unlike dedicated cruise ships, ocean liners usually have more extensive provisions for fuel, food, and other supplies during extended voyages.Ocean liners, while often luxurious, had certain features that made them unsuitable for cruising: high fuel consumption, heavy wind interference to enter shallow ports, weatherproof decks that were not suitable for tropical climates, and cabins prioritized for maximum comfort rather than convenience.As the design of passenger ships has evolved from oceanliners to cruise ships, the hull\'s interior has been replaced by superstructures with private verandas.Despite their seaworthy status, cruise ships of the present day offer extra amenities to accommodate water enthusiasts, and recent vessels have been described as floating condominiums filled with balconies.The separation between ocean liners and cruise ships has become less clear, especially with regards to deployment.Disparities in building design persist.Longer transoceanic voyages, such as those on a larger cruise ship, have resulted in longer trips that may take several months to complete.Marco Polo and other former ocean liners now function as cruise ships.There is a decrease in this number.The sole transatlantic ocean liner that is currently in service is the Cunard fleet\'s Queen Mary 2.Furthermore, she has access

both include pudding.It is believed that the word pudding originated from French, and it was derived from the Latin word botellus, which means "small sausage," and refers to meats in encased pieces used in European puddings.The United Kingdom and certain Commonwealth nations use pudding to describe both sweet and savory dishes.In its non-specific sense, the term commonly denotes a sweet.In the UK, a dessert course can be substituted with " pudding" as an alternative.Dessert puddings are rich and homogeneous desserts that contain starch or dairy products, such as rice pudding and Treacle sponge pudding, which can be made with or without dried fruits like Christmas pudding.Savory dishes like Yorkshire pudding, black pudding and suet pudding are listed in the Oxford English Dictionary alongside steak and kidney pudding.Pudding in the United States and certain regions of Canada is typically a sweet milk dessert that has resemblance to egg-based custards, instant cuStarts or mousse, and is frequently prepared using commercially available ingredients such as cornstarch, gelatin, or similar collagen agents.Custards or curd, as they are known in Commonwealth countries, are puddings that have been thickened with eggs, starch, and jelly.Although bread pudding and rice pudding are terms used to describe other foods, they are usually derived from British dishes.The term pudding has evolved from its original meaning to describe savoury dishes, such as sausages made using a similar method of packaging for liquid ingredients.Blood sausage, a favorite of King Henry VIII, and haggis are the most well-known examples that still exist.The initial pudding was created by combining different ingredients with a grain product or binder, such as butter, flour, cereal, eggs, and suet, to create ice-like solids.These desserts can be prepared by baking, steaming, or boiling.Depending on the ingredients used, this type of pudding can be served as either a starter or dessert.During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Royal Navy frequently served boiled or steamed pudding as the main course on ships.The main ingredient for the daily rations of flour and suet was pudding.Puddings are steamed pies that have a filling completely covered in suet pastry.Sweet and savory dishes, such as steak and kidney pudding, can be included in these.Savory Dessert Creamy puddings are two types of dessert that use sugar, milk, cornstarch, gelatin, eggs, rice, or tapioca as thickening agents to create a sweet and creamy texture.Simmering on top of the stove in a saucepan or double boiler, or baking in an oven, often in latrine, are the methods for making these puddings.Due to their susceptibility, these puddings are frequently cooked in a double boiler;The use of microwave ovens is now widespread to circumvent this issue and minimize stirring.Warm servings are a common practice for creamier desserts, but some, like zabaglione and rice pudding, can be served warm.Instant puddings can be prepared in a shorter amount of time, as they do not require boiling.The term pudding in North America and certain European nations like the Netherlands is frequently used, whereas in Britain it is known as custards and blancmange, which are puddings with egg thickness and starch thickness.Since the 14th century, there has been a proverb that states the pudding\'s taste is determined by its preparation.The phrase is commonly associated with Cervantes, a Spanish writer, in his novel The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote.The expression is frequently misquoted as  the proof is in the

signs of infection include a congested nose, runny nose (histamine), sneezing, and post-nasal drip.Inflammation of the mucous membrane is caused by viruses, bacteria, and allergens in rhinitis.Allergy is the most frequent cause of allergic rhinitis, which is caused by airborne allergens such as pollen and dander.Additional symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal itching, coughing, headache, fatigue, malaise, and cognitive impairment, may accompany allergic rhinitis.The eyes may be affected by the allergens, resulting in watery, reddened, or itchy eyes and puffiness.The inflammatory response leads to the production of significant amounts of mucus, which often results in a runny nose, as well as nasal congestion and drips after consumption.The inflammation of the nose is caused by the degranulation of mast cells in allergic rhinitis.The release of histamine and other chemicals by mast cells during degranulation can trigger an inflammatory response, leading to symptoms like fatigue and malaise outside the nose.The occurrence of infectious rhinitis can lead to pneumonia, which can be either viral or bacterial.Infectious rhinitis causes bacteria and viruses to be expelled from the respiratory system through sneezing.The occurrence of rhinitis is very frequent.Some countries have a higher incidence of allergic rhinitis;Between 10 percent and 30 percent of adults in the United States are affected annually.Although infectious rhinitis is usually classified as a clinical condition, there are three types of rhinoviruses: acute and chronic bacterial infections;Nonallergic vasomotor rhinitis can manifest as idiopathic, hormonal, atrophic, occupational, and gustatory, or drug-induced.Allergy-related rhinitis is caused by pollen, mold, animal dander, dust, Balsam of Peru, and other inhaled allergens.Influenza-induced swine, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses are frequently responsible for Infectious Rhinitis.The common cold causes rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat (pharyngitis), cough, congestion, and mild headache.Nonallergic rhinitis is the name given to a condition that is not caused by an allergy.Vasomotor rhinitis was once called so because it was believed to be caused by an overactive parasympathetic nerve response that resulted in vasodilation.Nonallergic rhinitis is now the more widely recognized term.The diagnosis is established after excluding the possibility of allergies.The term rhinitis covers a range of conditions, including occupational, chemical, smoking, hormonal, senile, medication-induced, local allergic, non-allergic, and idiopathic (vaginal or vasomotor) occurrences.The presence of nonspecific stimuli, such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, airborne irritants, spicy food, alcohol, sexual arousal, exercise, and emotional factors are all potential causes of vasomotor rhinitis.The issue remains largely unresolved, but it is speculated that non-allergic stimuli cause the blood vessels in the nasal lining to dilate, leading to obstruction and drainage.The combination of non-allergic and allergic rhinitis is known as  mixed roving.The pathology of vasomotor rhinitis is not well-known, and it seems to involve neurogenic inflammation.The prevalence of vascularmotor rhinitis in women is much higher than that in men, leading some researchers to speculate that hormones may play a role.The onset of symptoms usually occurs after 20 years, unlike allergic rhinitis that can arise at any stage.']], [[69, 'name the capital city of the canadian province of british columbia?', "BC, or British Columbia,

blues, and Western music.Throughout its recorded history, blues modes have been extensively utilized.Country music is characterized by its use of simple forms and harmonies, including ballads or dance songs, as well as harmonicas and other stringed instruments such as banjos.The 1940s saw the rise of country music as a more popular genre, replacing hillbilly music;The mid-20th century saw the emergence of Western music that developed from similar roots to hillbilly music.The term country music is now commonly used to describe various styles and subgenres in contemporary music.The roots of country music can be found in the folk songs of working-class white Americans who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional ballads like Cebu and Elviria, with additions from European immigrant communities and various musical traditions.In 2009, country music was the most popular rush hour radio format in the United States during evening commutes, with it ranking second on the list of preferred genres for morning commuters.For almost 300 years, European-style country music and instruments were brought to North America by immigrants who settled in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.The world was introduced to country music as a Southern phenomenon.The early 1920s saw the emergence of the first generation of recording artists, with Atlanta's music scene

and California.The Grand Ole Opry, which was broadcasted by WSM in Nashville from 1925 to the present day, was the most significant event.Hollywood-made films from the 1930s and 1940s made cowboy songs and Western music popular, which had been recorded since the 1920s.Another local country musician, Bob Wills, gained fame as the leader of a hot string band and featured in Hollywood westerns.Western swing was the term used to describe the combination of country and jazz that began as dance hall music.Wills was among the first country musicians to incorporate an electric guitar into their band in 1938.Following the Carnegie Hall concert, country musicians started recording a boogie by Johnny Barfield in 1939.The third generation of bluegrass music, which originated from mountaineer string bands and was introduced by Roy Acuff at the Grand Ole Opry during World War II, began with Bill Monroe and Lester Flatt.The use of gospel music in country music was still prevalent.A new type of stripped-down and unadorned music with a diverse range of emotions and rudimentary guitar, bass, dobro, and steel guitar (and later drums) gained popularity, particularly among low-class white residents in Texas and Oklahoma.The style, which was later known as honky tonk, had its origins in Western swing and ranchera music from Mexico and the border states.Most country bands in the early 1950s played a combination of Western swing, country boogie, and honky tonk.Country music enthusiasts were most fond of rockabilly in the 1950s, and 1956 was widely regarded as the year when country music started to embrace it.The Nashville Sound, headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, transformed country music into a multimillion-dollar industry by the mid-1950s and peaking in the early 1960s.Due to the traditionalist backlash within different genres, American music created a unique blend during the late 1960s."]], [[73, 'may 15, 1940 saw what fast food chain get started in san

Baldwin Park, California, in 1948.The chain, which is headquartered in Irvine, California, has gradually extended its reach beyond Southern California and into Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Texas, and Oregon.The Snyders\' sole offspring is their daughter, Lynsi Snyder.The chain has expanded and opened multiple distribution centers in addition to its Baldwin Park location.The recently constructed sites, situated in Lathrop, California;Phoenix, Arizona;Draper, Utah;Dallas, Texas will allow for the possibility of expanding to other parts of the United States in the future.In-N-Out Burger has refused to become a franchise or go public;The possibility of quality or customer consistency being compromised by excessively fast business growth is a possible explanation.Employee-centric personnel policies have been observed as a hallmark of the company\'s business practices.Among fast food chains in the United States, In-N-Out employees are paid more than the minimum wage requirements set by state and federal authorities, which range from US $ 9.As of August 2001, the hourly rate in California was 25.The In-N-Out chain has gained a significant number of loyal customers and has been recognized as one of the most highly rated fast food chains in customer satisfaction surveys.The Snyders founded the first In-N-Out restaurant in Baldwin Park, California\'s southwest corner of Interstate 10 and Francisquito Avenue in 1948.The first drive-thru hamburger stand in California equipped with a two-way speaker system allowed drivers to place their orders at the restaurant.Carhops were utilized in California after World War II to serve food and order orders, making this idea unique.According to the Snyders\' website, their plan is simple and has been utilized for years: "We offer customers the freshest food we can buy, highest quality, and friendly service in a sparkling clean environment."Three years after, a second In-N-Out was opened in Covina, California, west of the intersection of Grand Avenue and Arrow Highway.Until the 1970s, the company was a small-scale southern California chain.The Snyders maintained the quality of their initial restaurants by managing them with great care.At the time of Harry Snyder\'s death in 1976, at the age of 63, the chain had 18 restaurants.Rich Snyder, a second-generation businessman, took over as the company president in 1976 after his father\'s death.Rich, along with his brother Guy, was said to have started working at his father\'s In-N-Outs from the ground floor during their childhood.Over the next two decades, Rich\'s leadership led to a rapid expansion of the chain, which eventually reached 93 restaurants.The chain\'s 61st location was first opened in San Diego County in 1990, having previously been located outside of the Los Angeles metropolitan area.In Las Vegas, Nevada, In-N-Out opened its first restaurant that was not located in Southern California in 1992.In the following year, Modesto became the first location of its Northern California venture.Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area, saw an increase in restaurants in the Las Vegas area due to expansion.On December 15th, 1993, Rich Snyder and four other passengers lost their lives in a plane crash near John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, shortly after opening the 83rd In-N-Out restaurant in Fresno, CA.The charter aircraft they were traveling on had been following a Boeing 757 to land, but it got caught in the turbulence and crashed.Due to the crash investigation that followed, the Federal Aviation Administration mandated that light aircraft maintain an adequate distance from heavy aircraft to minimize wake turbulence.Following the death of Rich Snyder in 1993, Guy Snyder became the new president and continued the company\'s aggressive expansion until he died from an overdose of painkillers in 1999.In-N-Out grew from 83 to 140 stores during his six-year tenure as president.The

Roaring Twenties was marked by significant growth and widespread prosperity, which was fueled by the recovery from wartime destruction, postponed spending, a surge in construction, and the speedy development of consumer goods like automobiles and electricity.Despite the successful transition from war to peace, the United States' economy experienced growth and loans for European expansion.Nevertheless, there were stagnant sectors, with farming and mining being the most prominent.By becoming the wealthiest nation globally, advancing as the largest economy, aligning its industry with mass production, and transforming its society into a consumerist state, America achieved remarkable success.Around 1924, European economies underwent a more challenging adjustment and began to experience growth.The end of World War I saw soldiers returning to the United States and Canada with wartime pay and a range of new products available for purchase.The recession that followed World War I was a brief but deep recession caused by wartime production.The U. was swift in responding to the situation.S.The Canadian economy bounced back after the recruitment of soldiers and the restocking of factories for consumer goods production.The 1920s witnessed a period of increased consumer spending and economic pennies, driven by supply-side economic policy.The postwar era in the U.S. was marked by three Republican administrations in succession.S.In 1921, when President Warren Harding became president, the national economy was facing a severe depression with unemployment at 20

cosmology.Mitton had reservations about the equations in the preliminary manuscript, fearing that they might deter customers at airport bookstores who were interested in Hawking's proposals.He successfully convinced Hawking to abandon all but one equation, albeit with difficulty.The author notes in the book that he was cautioned that every equation in it would result in a reduced

prime minister is expected to work with other ministers to ensure the successful passage of bills through the legislature.The monarch in certain monarchies has the power to exercise executive powers, also known as the royal prerogative, which are constitutionally granted to the crown and can be used without parliamentary approval.In addition to their primary role as head of government, a prime minister may hold other titles or positions. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, for instance, is also the First Lord ofthe Treasury and the Minister for the Civil Service.During different periods, prime ministers may also hold other ministry positions. Winston Churchill served as the Minister of Defence during World War II, while Benjamin Netanyahu was the Prime Minister in Israel until recently.The chief ministers of Louis XIV and his descendants were generally not granted this title.The term prime minister, as we know it today, was first used in the 18th century by British parliamentarians who used it mockingly to refer to Sir Robert Walpole.Throughout time, the title acquired symbolic significance and continues to do so in today\'s era.The monarchs of England and the United Kingdom had ministers in whom they placed special trust, and who were considered the head of government.Thomas Cromwell was a prime example of this during the reign of Henry VIII;William Cecil and Lord Burghley were both under the rule of Elizabeth I;Queen Anne ruled over Godolphin and Charles II was in charge of Clarendon.These ministers were known by various names and official positions, including  the minister, chief minister or first minister respectively, and prime minster (or "prime minister").The monarch\'s personal favor was the sole determinant of the ministers\' authority.They did not rely on a parliamentary majority to hold power, even though they had the necessary skills to manage the parliament in high-ranking positions.Despite the presence of a cabinet, it was entirely appointed by the monarch and usually overseen by her.The monarch had the power to dismiss a first minister when they became dissatisfied with them, and in some cases, Cromwell was executed while Clarendon was forced into exile.To avoid any one minister from becoming too powerful, kings sometimes divided power equally among two or more ministers.In the later part of Anne\'s reign, the Tory ministers Harley and St John shared control.Parliament\'s position relative to the monarch was strengthened in the mid 17th century after the English Civil War (1642-1651), and it gained more power through the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689.The monarch was unable to create any laws or taxes without the House of Commons\' consent, leading to the latter becoming a part of the government.A modern type of prime minister starts to surface at this juncture.']], [[77, "which singer played the goblin king jareth in the film \x91labyrinth'?", "Labyrinth, a 1986 British-American adventure musical fantasy film, was directed by Jim Henson and executive produced by George Lucas, drawing inspiration from Brian Froud's conceptual designs.Sarah, played by Jennifer Connelly in the movie, is tasked with finding her 16-year-old brother Toby's body taken hostage by Jareth, the Goblin King (David Bowie), as she navigates through a maze of otherworldly creatures.Jim Henson's Creature Shop produces puppets for most of the major characters in the film, except for Bowie and Connelly.Henson and Froud began working together on the film, discussing ideas after seeing The Dark Crystal.In the early part of 1984, Terry Jones from Monty Python drew inspiration from Froud's sketches to compose the initial script for the movie.Despite being awarded the film's only screen-writing credit, Jones was not the only one who wrote the script.

lands.During its extended period of isolation, New Zealand developed a unique range of animal, fungal, and plant species.The country\'s varied terrain and towering mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, are largely due to the impact of volcanic eruptions and land uplift.Wellington is the capital city of New Zealand, and Auckland is its most populous city.A unique Mori culture was developed by the Polynesian inhabitants of the islands that would later become New Zealand between 1250 and 1300 CE.The first European to see New Zealand was Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer who did so in 1642.The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 by British Crown and Mori Chiefs, resulted in New Zealand becoming a British colony.Today, the majority of New Zealand\'s population of 4 is concentrated in this location.7 million people are of European origin;The Mori population is the most populous, with Asians and Pacific Islanders making up the second, third, and fourth largest minority groups.New Zealand\'s culture is largely influenced by Mori and early British colonizers, with the latter having expanded its influence due to increased immigration.English, Mori, and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages, with English being the most commonly used.The economy of New Zealand is based on market practices, making it a developed nation.New Zealand\'s high-income economy status is backed by the World Bank, which places it highly in international benchmarks for its health, education, economic freedom, and quality of life.The elected, unicameral Parliament has the power to enact laws for the nation, while the Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister John Key, exercises executive political authority.Queen Elizabeth II is the country\'s head of state and is represented by a Governor-General.New Zealand\'s local government is divided into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities.Tokelau is a constituent of New Zealand\'s Realm and falls under its sovereignty;The Cook Islands and Niue, which are both independent nations in free association with New Zealand;The Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand\'s territorial claim in Antarctica.The Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation are all organizations in which New Zealand is a member.In 1642, Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand and named it Staten Landt, possibly because he believed it was linked to a landmass located at the southernmost point of South America.Nova Zeelandia was the new title given to the land by Dutch cartographers in 1645, taking its name from the Dutch province of Zealand.The name of New Zealand was later anglicized by British explorer James Cook.Aotearoa, which means "land of the long white cloud," is the Mori name for New Zealand.It is uncertain whether Mori had a name for the entire country before Europeans arrived, as Aotearoa was originally limited to the North Island.Te Waipounamu or Te Waka o Aoraki were the names given to the canoe of Aori on the South Island, while the North Island was named as Te Ika-a-Mui (the fish of Mnui), which is another nomenclature for the islanders.The North, Middle, and South Islands were categorized as such on early European maps.The use of North and South on maps to differentiate the two largest islands was introduced in 1830 and became standard practice by 1907.The North Island and South Island\'s names were found to be unofficial by the New Zealand Geographic Board in 2009, with alternative names being formalised in 2013.Te Ika-a-Mui in North Island and Te Waipounamu in South Island were the two names chosen for this location.It is important to note that each island can be referred to using either its English or Mori name, or both at the same time.']], [[83, 'during world war ii, japan occupied which part of the usa?', "Although related conflicts began in the early 20th century, World War II (also called WWII or WW2) and the Second World war were two-year affairs that occurred worldwide from 1939 to 1945.The vast majority of the world's nations, including the major powers, ultimately formed two military alliances, namely the Allies and the Axis.The war was the most widespread in history, with over 100 million people from 30 different countries participating directly.During a state of absolute war, the major players expended their entire economic, industrial, and scientific resources towards the war effort, effectively eliminating the distinction between civilian and military resources.The deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centers, were a significant part of the estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.The deadliest occurrence in human history was World War II, caused by these events.The Empire of Japan sought to control Asia and the Pacific, and had already declared war on the Republic of China in 1937. Nevertheless, the world war was initiated on 1 September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland and subsequent French and British declarations of war against Germany.Between late 1939 and early 1941, Germany established the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan by launching numerous campaigns and treaties that resulted in the conquest or control of a significant portion of continental Europe.In August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which resulted in the division and annexation of territories belonging to Poland, Finland, Romania, and Latvia by neighboring countries.The war persisted mainly between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and British Commonwealth, with campaigns such as those in North Africa and East Africa, the Battle of Britain, bombing during the Blitzkriegs, leading up to 1918-1923, and fighting in the Balkans and early 1944.The invasion of the Soviet Union by the European Axis powers in June 1941 resulted in the largest land theatre of war ever, leading to a war of attrition for the majority of their military forces.Japan launched an attack on the United States and European territories in the Pacific Ocean in December 1941, resulting in extensive Western Pacific conquests.After Japan's defeat in the Battle of Midway near Hawaii, Germany was defeated in North Africa and then at Stalingrad in Soviet Union, bringing the Axis' advance to a halt.The Axis lost the initiative in 1943 due to a sequence of Eastern Front defeats, Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy, and allied victories in the Pacific.In 1944, the Western Allies launched an invasion of France that was occupied by Germany, while the Soviet Union regained all its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies.The Japanese experienced significant setbacks in South Central China and Burma during 1944 and 1945, while the Allies took control of important Western Pacific islands and rendered the Japanese naval obsolete.The Western Allies and the Soviet Union launched an invasion of Germany, which ended with the capture of Berlin by Soviet and Polish forces and ultimately resulted in the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945.The United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August, respectively, after Japan's refusal to surrender under the Potsdam Declaration signed by the Allies on 26 July 1945.The Japanese surrendered on August 15, 1945, as a result of an impending invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of further atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan and invasion in Manchuria.The war in Asia was brought to a close, solidifying the Allies' triumph.The political and social structure of the world were transformed by World War II.The UN was established to promote global cooperation and prevent potential conflicts.The United Nations Security Council's permanent members were made up of the victorious great powers, including the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and the UK, as well as France."]], [[84, 'which event held in alberta, canada, which bills itself as the greatest outdoor

state of Montana.Only one U.S. territory can be surrounded by Alberta, making it one of only three Canadian provinces and territories to do so.S.The state is one of the two only landlocked provinces.The climate is mainly humid continental and differs significantly from the seasons, but seasonal temperature mean changes are less significant than in areas further east due to sudden warming caused by occasional chinook winds in the winter.Edmonton, situated near the geographic center of Alberta, is the main provider and service center for Canada's northern resource industries, including crude oil, Athabasca oil sands, and other resources.Calgary, situated approximately 290 km to the south of the capital, is the biggest city in Alberta.The two census metropolitan areas in Alberta, Calgary and Edmonton, have populations exceeding one million, and the province has 16 census agglomerations.Banff, Canmore, Drumheller, Jasper, and Sylvan Lake are all popular tourist destinations in the province.The name Alberta is derived from Princess Louise Caroline Alberta, who was the fourth daughter of Victoria, Queen of Canada, and Albert, Prince Consort, according to Etymology.John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, and Governor General of Canada were married to Princess Louise between 1878 and 1983.Her name was also honored through the naming of Lake Louise and Mount

between the province and the US state of Montana in its southern area, while the 60th Parallel North separates it from the Northwest Territories in their northern area.To the east, the 110th meridian separates it from Saskatchewan, while to the west, it shares a boundary with British Columbia that extends from the Northwest Territories at 60°N and follows the Continental Divide in descending order.The province's width at its maximum is 1223 km from north to south and 660 km east to west.The highest point in the area is Mount Columbia, which stands at 3747 m above sea level on the southwest border of the Rocky Mountains. In the northeast, it has its lowest point at 152 mm along the Slave River in Wood Buffalo National Park.The province possesses ample water resources, except for the semi-arid steppe located in the southeast.A multitude of rivers and lakes are available for water sports such as swimming, fishing, and more.Lakes such as Lake Claire, Lesser Slave Lake, and Lake Athabasca are abundant in the Canadian Rocky Mountain region.The Athabasca River, the longest river in the province, runs from the Columbia Icefield in Colorado to Lake Athospia on a distance of 1538 km.With an average flow of 2161 m3/s, the Peace River is the largest river.From the Rocky Mountains in northern British Columbia, the Peace River flows through northern Alberta and becomes a tributary of the Mackenzie River, known as the Slave River.The Alberta capital city, Edmonton, is situated in the geographic center of the province.The city's location in the northern part of Canada is ideal for both accessing resources and advancing towards resource development, making it the most northerly major city.Due to its proximity to the largest oil fields in Canada, the area has most of the oil refineries in western Canada.Roughly 280 km south of Edmonton and 240 km north of Montana lies Calgary, which is encompassed by vast ranching country."]], [[85, "what was johnny cash's home state", 'John R.J. was

esteemed Archangel, having been hailed for defeating Satan in battle in heaven.He is regarded as a leading angelic protector, safeguarding against darkness and overseeing cosmic intelligence.In Britain and Ireland, particularly, the use of quarter days by Michaelmas has resulted in the definition of time and seasons for secular purposes.With the exception of the Serbian Orthodox Church, all Eastern Orthodoxy observes Michaelmas.Instead of other holidays, the Greek Orthodox celebrate the archangels on 8 November.During the fifth century, a basilica near Rome was dedicated to Michael on 30 September, with festivities beginning on the day of the event. The western Church now commemorates 29 September as an occasion to honour Michael and all Angels.Michaelmas, also known as the Feast of St., was celebrated in the Middle Ages.Until the 18th century, Michael was celebrated as a Holy Day of Obligation, but this custom was discontinued.A hymn called "Lord God to Thee We Give" is sung in Lutheran churches on this special day, which is considered by Lutherans to be the feast of Christ.The northern hemisphere associates its location with the beginning of autumn and the decrease in daylight due to its proximity to the equinox.Accounts had to be settled during the quarter days of English, Welsh, and Irish.A reeve was elected from the peasants on manors.Michaelmas hiring fairs were conducted in either the end of September or early October.The name Michaelmas is derived from a contraction of "Michael\'s Mass," which is conducted in the same manner as Christmas and Candlemas, with candles being blessed during all seasons.A procession was organized on the Isle of Skye in Scotland to celebrate.Lughnasadh had incorporated sports, games, and horse racing into its daily routine, which has been replicated in modern times.The Michaelmas

semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, taking place at Hillsborough, which is Sheffield Wednesday\'s home ground.The disaster led to several safety upgrades on the biggest football stadiums, including the removal of standing terraces and the installation of spectator fencing to prevent pitch invasions.The police were deemed responsible for the deaths in the early stages of investigations, but the coroner\'s inquest determined that the accidents did not result in any legal action.Despite facing initial rejection, the grieving family launched a campaign for truth and justice, ultimately resulting in another inquest verdict in 2016, which exonerated fans of any wrongdoing and recorded judicial evidence of unlawful killing.Liverpool supporters were attracted to the two central pens in the Leppings Lane stand;In an effort to alleviate overcrowding outside the entrance turnstiles, the police match commander chief superintendent David Duckenfield opened the exit gate, resulting in approximately 2,000 supporters being drawn into a tunnel that led to the central pens, trapping spectators already present in the crowded areas with fences.The gate was opened at 2:52 pm, despite the scheduled start time of 3 pm;The game was halted by 1:06 pm.In the days that followed, a multitude of falsehoods about the disaster emerged as police spread propaganda to the press, leading to The Sun\'s headline "The Truth."The issues persisted even after the 1990 Taylor Report, which concluded that SYP\'s lack of control was the primary cause of the disaster and that fans\' behavior did not play a role.Taylor criticized the police\'s efforts to shift the blame, but the DPP determined that there was no evidence to support pursuing individuals or institutions for misconduct.The coroner\'s decision was met with strong opposition from families who opposed his decision not to investigate events after 3.It\'s 15:15.The authorities were unable to accept the new

police conduct in the aftermath.The initial inquest decision was invalidated in 2012, and a subsequent verdict was delivered from 1 April 2014 to 26 April 2016, marking the longest jury trial in British history.The verdict was that police and ambulance services\' grossly negligent failure to fulfill their duty of care led to the unlawful killing of supporters.The stadium\'s design was found to have played a role in the deadly crowd, and the inquest concluded that supporters were not accountable for the dangerous environment.David Crompton, the chief constable of SYP, was suspended for his actions during the second inquest.The verdict was followed by a private prosecution on behalf of hundreds of relatives against SYP and the West Midlands Police force, which sought to conceal the

number that is not a prime number and is greater than 1 in magnitude is classified as referred to as composite.As an illustration, 5 is considered a prime number because it has only 1 and 5, respectively, as its positive integer factors, while 6 is classified as composite because of the addition of 1, 2, 3, and 6 to those factors.The fundamental theorem of arithmetic asserts that primes hold the most significance in number theory, as any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as (1+) and >/-1.The uniqueness of this theorem necessitates the exclusion of 1 as a prime number because it can be included in any factorization with different numbers, for example.The g.1  3 and 1 to the power of 3, respectively.There are several acceptable factorizations of 3.The attribute of primality is associated with whether a number is prime or not.A straightforward yet time-consuming approach to verifying the primality of a number is known as trial division.Test: Find if [n(-n)] is divisible by any integer between 2 and 6sqrt  n.The primality of large numbers can be tested using algorithms that are much more efficient than trial division.The Miller-Rabin primality test is fast but has a small chance of error, while the AKS primity test always yields correct answers in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical.Mersenne numbers are among the special forms that can be solved using particularly speedy methods.The prime number with the most decimal digits known is 22,338,618.The existence of an infinite number of primes was proven by Euclid in 300 BC.A simple formula that can differentiate prime numbers from composite numbers is not currently known.A model can be used to model the distribution of primes, which involves the statistical behavior of large prime numbers.The prime number theorem, which was proven in the late 1800s, is the initial outcome in that direction. It states that the probability of a randomly selected number being prime is proportional to its number of figures or the logarithm of numbers.Several questions about prime numbers remain unanswered, including Goldbach's hypothesis that all even integers greater than 2 can be represented as the sum of two primes.These inquiries prompted the growth of diverse fields of number theory, which concentrated on the algebraic or analytic aspects of numbers.In information technology, primes are employed in various practices, including public-key cryptography, which utilizes their properties, such as the challenge of factoring large numbers into their prime factors.Prime numbers lead to the development of generalizations in other mathematical fields, particularly algebra, such as prime elements and prime ideals.A natural number and its definition, along with some illustrations.e.You can choose from the ones listed below, as well as those in between.The term prime number or a prime is defined as having two positive divisors, 1 and the number itself, which are identical.The term composite is used to describe natural numbers that are not prime but exceed 1.Of the six numbers, 2, 3, and 5 are prime, but 1 – 4 is not one (i.e.For the reasons outlined below, 1 is not considered a prime number.The fact that only 1 and 2 are natural numbers means that 2 can be a prime number.The fact that 3 is prime also means that when 3 and 1 are divided by 3, there is no remainder, but the value of 3 with 2 gives a remainder of 1.As a result, 3 is considered prime.Nevertheless, the fact that 2 is another number in the set of 1, 4, and 4 yields no remainder indicates that 4 is a composite.The number 5 can be expressed as a prime number, with no division by any of the numbers.Assuming that 2 and 3 are equal to 6, then 6 can be divided by either 2 or 3.Therefore, 6 is not a prime number.The image on the right displays that 12 is not a prime number:."]], [[91, 'kelly jones, richard jones and richard cable founded which group', 'Kelly Jones, who was born on June 3, 1974, is a Welsh singer-songwriter, guitarist, and director, most recently with the lead vocalist of Stereophonics.Jones, who has been influenced by classic rock bands such as Pink Floyd, The Who, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, and Sex Pistols, is known for his raspy voice, which has garnered both praise and criticism.Jones\' lyricist background is shaped by the influences of Neil Young, Bob Catley, Steve Perry, and Bob Dylan, as well as Otis Redding.In his early years and later years, Jones resided in the village of Cwmaman near Aberdare. He formed a covers band with his neighbours, Stuart Cable and Richard Jones, after becoming friends.During his younger years, he demonstrated an aptitude for writing and contemplated a career in scriptwriting before venturing into film studies.The BBC was interested in some of his early work, but as the band progressed from a cover band to writing their own material, he turned his narrative side towards writing lyrics.In addition, Jones explored the possibility of pursuing boxing as a profession and was able to perform at the youth level successfully.Stereophonics\' debut album chronicles his early life by recounting stories of a market stall during his teenage years.The first album of Stereophonics, Word Gets Around, released in 1997, features a documented story of these events.The year 1999 saw Stereophonics become the first band to be signed by Richard Branson on Virgin Records\' new label V2.Their debut EP Looks Like Chaplin was not successful enough to make it onto the charts, and their next single Local Boy in the Photograph fell just one place below the UK Top 50.Despite this, the band\'s first album Word Gets Around reached number 6 on the UK Albums Chart.The band was supported by Manic Street Preachers, a Welsh band, during their 1996-97 tour.The band\'s popularity was evident in February 1998 when they won the Brit Award for Best New Group. Their re-issue of Local Boy in the Photograph also made it to the top 14, selling over 100,000 copies and reaching number 14 on the UK charts.In that year, Stereophonics went on tours across Europe, Australia, and the USA.On 12 June 1998, they gave a concert at Cardiff Castle.The album Reload featured a cover of the Randy Newman song Mama Told Me Not to Come, which was also performed by Tom Jones.Following another tour, they returned to the studios and recorded Just Enough Education to Perform, which featured the song Mr.The author shares with Have a Nice Day and Step on My Old Size Nines.Rod Stewart re-did his version of Mike D\'Abo\'s Handbags & Gladrags on later releases of the album.Their largest audience ever was recorded when they played to 80,000 people at Slane Castle in Ireland, followed by a Christmas show at Cardiff\'s Millennium Stadium, which they had previously supported with Feeder and Ocean Colour Scene.You Got ta Go There to Come Back, their fourth studio album, was released with songs like Maybe Tomorrow and Madame Helga, as well as a delayed reworked version of the song Moviestar.The album was re-released with the inclusion of this track.The band was picked as a backing act for Counting Crows in 2002 and performed with them on various UK tours.Jones would later perform on stage with the band and sing Mr.Adam Duritz and Jones, the companions of Hanginaround.Stuart Cable, who had his own TV talk show on BBC Wales, was dismissed by Jones in 2003 while touring in Germany due to issues with his "commitment".During the rest of the tour, Steve Gorman, the drummer for Black Crowes, temporarily replaced the cable.I kept walking away,\' said Stuart.I was aware that we were not doing very well when we started, and I hoped for a better outcome.It was becoming evident that it wouldn\'t happen, and I confirmed it.Kelly was not fond of that particular detail.The fifth studio album of Stereophonics, Language, was released.Sex.Intimidation.What are some other options?']], [[92, 'opened in 1963, which london nightclub did mark birley name after his then wife?', "A nightclub, which can be shortened to discothèque, dance club, or club), is typically an entertainment venue that runs continuously until late hours of the day.A nightclub usually has dance floor and DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music.Friday and Saturday nights are the most popular at a nightclub.In nightclubs, the music can be live bands or a DJ playing dozens of songs set to blaring PA.The majority of clubs or club nights feature a variety of music genres.Between 1900 and 1920, working class Americans would congregate at honky tonks or juke joints in the city to dance to music played on a piano or by local musicians.Webster Hall, constructed in 1886, is recognized as the first modern nightclub, having started out as a social hall that hosted dance and political activism events.The United States saw nightclubs go underground as illegal speakeasy bars during Prohibition, while Webster Hall remained open and there were reports of Al Capone's involvement and police corruption.Following the repeal of Prohibition in February 1933, nightclubs like New York's 21 Club, Copacabana, El Morocco, and the Stork Club were brought back to life.There were no DJs in these nightclubs, only big bands.The first discothèque in Germany was likely Scotch-Club.The Nazis in Occupied France prohibited jazz, bebop music, and jitterbug dance due to decadent American influences. As a result, people met at hidden basements known as discothèques to play jazz and swing music on bare hands, with no jukebox available.Zazous, a group of anti-Vichy youths, also patronized these discothèques.Nazi Germany had underground discothèques that were patronized by the swing kids, who were anti-Nazi youth.White audiences in Harlem frequented Connie's Inn and the Cotton Club.Most bars and nightclubs used a jukebox or mostly live bands before 1953 and some years later.During the establishment of Whisky à Gogo in Paris in 1947, Régine switched to two turntables and installed a dance-floor with colored lights in 1953.The Whisky à Gogo established the fundamental components of the present-day discothèque-style club, which was designed after World War II.In the late 1950s, afternoon dancing was introduced by several coffee bars in Soho, and Les Enfants Terribles at 93 Dean St. was the most well-known establishment of its kind on the continent.The original discothèques were not only unlicensed, but also catered to a young public that included French and Italians working illegally in the catering industry to learn English and au pair girls from western Europe.Annabel's, a discothèque nightclub in Berkeley Square, London, opened by Mark Birley to members only during the early 1960s.In 1962, the Peppermint Lounge in New York City became a hit and is where go-go dancing originated.The first rock and roll generation favored rough and tumble bars and taverns over nightclubs, and it wasn't until the disco era of the 1970s that nightlife became mainstream.The  Arthur '' discothèque, established by Sybil Burton, the ex-wife of actor Richard Burton in 1965, was the first, foremost, and hottest discorfestival in New York City from its debut until 1969, located on East 54th Street in Manhattan, after the old El Morocco nightclub.Time magazine reports on...On May 14, 1965,The person in question is Brewster, B.It follows that;The person in question is Froughton.Grove Press published Last Night a Disc Jockey Saved My Life in 2000, with pages from various authors.The score was 62-64.During the 1970s, Disco disco emerged from the underground club scene.

Wellington) emerged victorious over the French under Major-General Jean-Andoche Junot in the Battle of Vimeiro near Lisbon, Portugal.The first French invasion of Portugal was halted by this battle.A French army under General Junot attacked Wellesley's army near Vimeiro, Quarantine, four days after the Battle of Roliça.The initial battle was one of maneuver, with French troops attempting to outmaneuver the British forces, but Wellesley was able to redeploy his troops to confront the assault.Junot sent out two central columns, but they were repelled by sustained volleys from the troops in line.Junot was able to retreat towards Torres Vedras after defeating the flanking attack, which resulted in the loss of 2,000 men and 13 cannon, while the Anglo-Portuguese suffered 700 casualties.Wellesley was overtaken by Sir Harry Burrard and Sir Hew Dalrymple during the battle, leading to no pursuit.After Roliça, Wellesley had settled near Vimeiro.The British commander secured the village and some ridges to the west while also safeguarding a beachhead at Maceira Bay.Wellesley had a plan to move towards Lisbon as his reinforcements had already arrived by 20 August.Rowland Hill, Ronald Fergusson, Miles Nightingall, Barnard Bowes, Catlin Craufurd, Henry Fane, Robert Anstruther and Wroth Acländs constituted the core of Wellesley's forces, with eight independent infantry brigades.The force that he had was composed of 17 cannons and 240 light cavalry, with C as the leader.D.Taylor and Nicholas Trant, along with approximately 2,000 Portuguese soldiers, together made up a force of 20,000 soldiers.Junot arranged his army, consisting of 14,000 soldiers, into two infantry groups and one cavalry division led by Pierre Margaron.The infantry division of Henri François Delaborde was composed of two brigades, which were led by Antoine Xavier Brenier and Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières, while Louis Hendrix Loison had two command brgades with Jean-Baptiste Solignac and Hugues Charlot.François Étienne de Kellermann was in charge of a 2,100-man reserve that included four converged grenadier battalions.These units were formed by obtaining the grenadier company from all of Junot's infantry battalions.The French fought with 23 cannons.The positions of Anstruther and Fane's brigades were positioned in front of Vimeiro by Wellesley, while Acland'S men supported him.Initially, the western ridge was the only one that he had left among the five brigades.Junot intended to dispatch Thomieres, Solignac, and Charlot's infantry brigades to take Vimeiro, while Brenier'S 4,300-man brgade and some dragoons maneuvered across a wide ridge to seize an unoccupied territory in the northeast of the village.After detecting Brenier's move, Wellesley instructed Nightingall, Fergusson, and Bowes to head towards the northeastern ridge.Upon realizing that the British army had taken over the ridge, Junot dispatched Solignac's brigade to the right to support Brenier in his attack.Instead of allowing his flanking maneuver to take effect, the French commander ordered an immediate attack on the town.All the initial and subsequent maneuvers in the Battle resulted in a sequence of uncoordinated French assaults.The British position was first tackled by Thomieres' 2,100-strong brigade.With the assistance of three cannons and screened by skirmishers, the brigade was transformed into a group of companies.A line of 120 men formed to form a front rank that was 40 men wide.The first company's replacement company merged with all the other companies, creating a brigade that was roughly 40 feet in size and 48 ranks deep.The French belief was that once the enemy main position was established, companies would retreat to the right or left, creating a firing line that could only contain three files and spread out over several companies.In contrast, French commanders frequently launched home attacks while stationed in columns, relying entirely on their skirmishers and artillery to provide the necessary firepower.In response to the French skirmishers, Fane separated four riflemen from the 60th Regiment of Foot and 95th Rifles.The French skirmishers were outnumbered and fought back, leaving them behind as they retreated to the flanks of the brigade column.The French column failed to alert the soldiers in front of the 50th Regiment and skirmished into the enemy's bunker without their permission."]], [[94, "following success at the 1979 election whose party conference speeech included the lines 'you turn if you want to, the lady's

Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and Leader ofthe Conservative Party from 1975 to 90.She held the position of the longest-serving prime minister in Britain during the 20th century and was also the first female to hold such a position.Her uncompromising political and leadership approach was dubbed by a Soviet journalist as the "Iron Lady."Thatcherism was the term used to describe her actions as Prime Minister.Thatcher, who had previously worked as a research chemist and barrister, was elected as an MP for Finchley in 1959.In 1970, Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his government.During the 1975 Conservative Party leadership election, Thatcher became the first female leader of a major political party in the UK, defeating Heath and becoming the Leader of the Opposition.After winning the 1979 general election, she assumed the role of Prime Minister.After relocating to, Thatcher implemented a range of political and economic measures aimed at turning around the ongoing recession and high unemployment rates in Britain.Her political ideology and economic strategies were centered on deregulation, particularly in the financial sector, flexible labor markets, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reduction of trade union power and influence.During her initial years in office, Thatcher\'s popularity declined due to the recession and high unemployment rates. However, after winning the Falklands War in 1982 helped boost her popularity and she was re-elected in 1983.Thatcher was elected for a third term in 1987.Her backing of a Community Charge, also known as the  poll tax, was heavily unpopular during this period, and her views on the European Community were not shared by anyone in her Cabinet.In November 1990, she stepped down as Prime Minister and party leader due to Michael Heseltine\'s challenge to her leadership.Following her retirement from the Commons in 1992, she was granted a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in Lincolnshire, which enabled her to sit in the House of Lords.Following a series of small strokes in 2002, she was advised to cease speaking.Despite this, she was able to pre-record a eulogy to Ronald Reagan that was broadcasted at his funeral in 2004.She passed away in 2013 at the age of 87 due to a second stroke in London.Margaret Hilda Roberts was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire on 13 October 1925, where she participated in the early years and pursued her education.Alfred Roberts, who was born in Northamptonshire, fathered her daughter Beatrice Ethel (née Stephenson), who hailed from Lincolnshire.Her upbringing was in Grantham, where her father had two supermarkets.The apartment on North Parade was where she and her older sister Muriel, who lived until 2004, were raised.Being a local alderman and specializing in preaching, her father was involved in both Methodist politics and community life. He raised his daughter as an unyielding Wesleyan Methodist who attended the Finkin Street Methodist Church.Despite being born into a Liberal family, he maintained his Independent status, as was typical in local government at the time.Following the Labour Party\'s victory in the 1950 election, he was removed as alderman after serving as Mayor of Grantham from 1945 to 1946.After attending Huntingtower Road Primary School, Margaret Roberts was granted a scholarship to attend Kesteven and Grantham Girls\' School.The reports from her school indicated a steady increase in productivity and improved performance;She engaged in activities like playing the piano, playing field hockey, giving poetry recitals, swimming, and walking.She held the position of head girl from 1942 to 1943.She applied for a scholarship to study chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, in her upper sixth year, but was not accepted until another applicant withdrew.In 1943, Roberts enrolled at Oxford and graduated with Second-Class Honours in Chemistry in 1947.

connection to Spanish culture are known as taurarius or toureiro.In a bullfight, the performers include the lead actor who leads the group to shoot and kill the bull, known as maestro, or the official title matador de toros.Among the other bullfighters in the entourage are the subalternos, who wear suits with silver embroidery rather than matadors that have gold on them, and include picadores, rejoneadoreS, banderilleros.The term torero is sometimes used in English to refer to a toreador.The term is not present in Spanish;The syllables of the word were created by Georges Bizet for his opera Carmen, as it was necessary to match the song\'s timing.The number of women who have been bullfighters on foot or horseback is extremely low;Cristina Sánchez is a recent illustration.Feminal matadors have faced significant resistance and public opposition from enthusiasts and fellow matadores, possibly due to their perceived lack of physical agility.The fight between toreros and younger bulls, known as novilleros or vaquillas in Latin America, is the usual course of action.Only after a special match known as " the Alternative" can mature bulls start fighting.The novillero, a junior bullfighter, is introduced to the audience as el mejor de toros during the bull fight.Despite its name, bullfighting is not considered a separate sport and is instead performed as an art form.There is no contest, uncomplicated punctuation, or a formal classification.Moreover, bullfighting has a historical background that began with nobles riding horses and then featuring commoners on horseback who were involved in assisting others.The importance of the work done by the common people on foot grew as time passed, and it became the primary activity.Although not as frequently as on foot, horseback equestrian fighting is still considered a distinct and separate activity called  rejoneo, which can be enjoyed today.The popularity of bullfighting on the foot has led to fame and fortune for poor, able-bodied men, similar to the success of boxing in the United States.A famous torero was reportedly asked why he put his life on the line, and one man responded with "Más cornadas da el hambre" to the question.)Nowadays, it is typical for bullfighters to be born into families that have a family of bull fighters.The term Maletilla or espontáneo, which is customary, refers to individuals who illegally enter the ring and attempt bullfighting for their own benefit and pride.Despite the widespread dislike of the custom among both spectators and fans, El Cordobés and others began their careers in this manner.Matador de Toros is the name given to this animal.The person who kills bulls, originating from the Latin word mactator, is considered to be an artist and an athlete, known for their agility, grace, and coordination.One of the most famous matadors was Juan Belmonte (1892-1962), whose style revolutionized the sport of bullfighting and is still used today as a benchmark for many bull fighters.The matador\'s style and bravery are considered equally important as the likelihood of killing the bull.The most accomplished matadores were once treated like pop stars, with comparable financial success, cult followings, and tabloid tales of their romantic relationships.Even today, the highest-paid matadors earn less in real terms than their peers in the 1960s, resulting in limited media coverage of the " mediáticos" and not including any of Spain\'s celebrated bullfighters.The performing matador\'s mystique is heightened by the fact that they are bullfighters, which

John Entwistle, and Keith Moon, was their signature sound.The band\'s live shows and studio work made them a highly respected and influential rock band of the 20th century, with worldwide sales of over 100 million records.The Who grew out of the Detours and became part of pop art and mod, with their auto-destructive art that involved breaking down guitars (and drums) on stage.Their first single, I Can\'t Explain, helped them make it to the top ten in the UK chart, and they later had a number of other singles such as "My Generation," "Substitute," and "Happy Jack."During their extensive touring, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and released the US top ten single I Can See for Miles.Tommy, the rock opera released in 1969, featured the single "Pinball Wizard" and was a major hit both critically and commercially.Their reputation as a rock band was solidified by their performances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival, as well as the release of Live at Leeds in 1967.The success of Townshend, the lead singer and visionary, caused an increase in pressure, leading to the abandonment of Lifehouse, which was based on Tommy.In 1971, Who\'s Next was composed of songs from the project, including the popular song Won\'t Get Fooled Again.In 1973, the group released the album Quadrophenia to honor their mod roots, and in 1975, they supervised the

a tour of Quadrophenia.In 1999, they resumed their regular touring schedule and toured with drummer Zak Starkey.Plans for a new album by Entwistle were postponed following their death in 2002.Endless Wire was released by Townshend and Daltrey in 2006, with both of them remaining on the Who tour and regularly performing live.The Who\'s contributions to rock music were significant, owing to their mastery of the Marshall stack, use of large PA systems, synthesized instruments, lead playing styles such as Entwistle and Moon, feedback and power chord guitar technique by Townshend, and the development of pop opera.Hard rock, punk rock and mod bands have recognized their influence, and their songs continue to receive frequent exposure.Acton County Grammar School provided the background for Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, and John Entwistle, who were among the founding members of the Who.Cliff Townshend and his mother Betty, who had experience singing in the Royal Air Force\'S entertainment division during World War II, played a significant role in supporting their son\'s interest in rock and roll.During their second year in Acton County, Townshend and Entwistle formed a trad jazz ensemble; they became friends.The Middlesex Schools\' Symphony Orchestra featured entwistle in their performances, as well as French horn.Both individuals were drawn to rock music, and Townshend was particularly fond of Cliff Richard\'s debut single,  Move It.The guitarist, entwistle, struggled with guitar playing due to his large fingers, but eventually transitioned to bass after being inspired by Duane Eddy\'s guitar performances.He couldn\'t afford a bass and constructed one at home.Following his time in Acton County, Townshend opted for Ealing Art College, which he later

skipper.The stories center on the crew\'s high spirits while embarking on their voyage aboard the tred, which is his favorite vessel and has an exceptional reputation.He had a crossover with Erchie MacPherson, the other famous character from Munro\'s well-known book series, My Droll Friend. Para Shandaidh, meaning Peter (Paraig) son of Sandy, is the name that his family uses to identify themselves.Dan Macphail, Dougie, Colin Turner, and Sunny Jim are the main characters in the four man crew.Para Handy\'s friend, Hurricane Jack (who goes by the name John Maclachlan), is also present alongside him as a more unconventional adventurer.Dougie the mate has the option of selecting either Cameron or Campbell as his surname, which is an inconsistency in the stories.The crew faces significant challenges, including the transportation of Ministers, gravestone transportation, the Cluthas vessels for passengers crossing the Clyde, and Macphail\'s penchant for rape-inflicted bodice pieces.The stories are situated in the Firth of Clyde, Loch Fyne, and sometimes even the Western Isles of Scotland.The tales are favored due to their Scottish humor and the portrayal of a past when coastal communities relied solely on water transportation, unlike today\'s use of road and ferry services.Gaelic was still spoken by some people as their native language during this time, and the community was well-known to everyone, whether it was for good or evil reasons.The church, or kirk, was of greater significance in social interactions, and modern readers would have been familiar with the humorous implications of scriptural misquotations.The kirk contains allusions to rifts, which could be troublesome for those who were overly serious in their defense of their splinter group.These tales provide insight into the lifestyle and demeanor of the Firth of Clyde, its tributary sea lochs, and Glasgow city to those who are not familiar with them.The  Glasgow Evening News\' column featured occasional pieces written by locals, including those from Highland descent and urban residents who frequently sought refuge in the Clyde resorts such as Rothesay, Millport, Dunoon, and Tighnabruaich.Para Handy\'s Vital Spark makes it to Arran and Loch Fyne, which were previously unknown but are now reachable by city residents due to the popularity of railway steamers.The writings were crafted during the First World War and provided an insight into the local community, always presented in a humorous manner.The worth of these renowned pieces as sources that depict the lifestyle of the local residents during the Edwardian and WW1 era is evident.They reveal a poignant aspect when read alongside the narrative history of the Western Front.The stories recounted about rural communities were so amusing that they could easily be demolished in a single day of the war.Even so, the tales remained in demand.']], [[99, 'what animal did reggie perrin think of every time his mother-in-law was mentioned?', 'The British sitcom The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin featured Leonard Rossiter in the title role, which was a result of reading several novels.The books and TV series were written by David Nobbs, with his own adaptation of the novel.

of the previous era, which focused on uninteresting suburban family life.The series\' first novel, The Death of Reginald Perrin, was published in 1975, and its title was later changed to match the TV show\'s.In anticipation of the second and third television series, Nobbs wrote two novels: The Return of Reginald Perrin in 1977 and The Better World of re-tamer in 1978.The series would not progress if it did not adhere to the novel elements, according to Rossiter.Between 1976 and 1979, the three original television series with the same name were aired.A fourth book, The Legacy of Reginald Perrin, was also written by Nobbs and released in 1996.Series One, which ran from August 8 to 20 October 1976, was the first series that centered on Nobbs\' novel The Death of Reginald Perrin and was later renamed The Fall and Rise of Regaldo to complement the TV show.The replacement title is still in use for it.The mid-life crisis of Reginald Iolanthe Perrin is causing him to try and escape from his miserable life.The Poets Estate in Climthorpe, located at 12 Coleridge Close, is where he lives, and it differs from other areas due to the streets being named after well-known poets.He works as a

engineering hub for the local mine and railway industries.St Blazey is positioned 3 miles to the east of St Austell, 1 mile to West of Tywardreath, and 1mile north of Par.The town commemorates the feast day of Saint Blaise on 3 February with a procession and service, named after him.Prideaux Castle, an Iron Age hillfort, is situated in the parish of Luxulyan, which is a mile north of the town.The Biscovey Stone is an ancient Celtic cross\'s shaft.Although it was engraved, the text is no longer legible.Several theories exist regarding the nature of the stone;The Saxon advance into the county is traced back to 600 AD, according to one source, while another suggests it was around 900 AD.It is believed that the head was taken off during the Reformation.A gate post was erected on the stone near the St Blazey turnpike gate.It was transferred to St Mary\'s Church, Biscovey, in 1896.The church, which was built between 1440 and 1445, is dedicated to Saint Blaise.It takes the place of a previous church that was mentioned in 1294.Until the Reformation, Tywardreath Priory was in charge of the parish.In 1834, it was separated from St Austell parish.The original name for the location was Landrait or Landreath, which means Church on the Sand in the Cornish language.The valley below St Blazey was once an estuary to the River Par, and it reached its lowest point at the river crossing in the 16th century.The estuary was reduced to marsh land in the early 1800s due to tin mining activities on the river\'s banks.Joseph Treffry built the Par Canal between 1829 and 1835;It is situated

Mine is situated in the south west.The Fowey Consols mine, which is more extensive, can be found in the vicinity of Tywardreath.The Par Harbour port, situated in the parish, was created to facilitate the transportation of minerals and was initially linked to the mines by the Par Canal.Par is situated in the parish, but the village of Par can be found across the River Par and falls under the civil parish of Tywardreath.The Par Canal was quickly substituted by the Cornwall Minerals Railway, which still operates as part of the Atlantic Coast Line and had a depot and station in the town.While St Blazey depot remains operational, St. Blacey station was shut down in 1925, and the town is now served by Par station on the Cornish Main Line located in Par village.The Eden Project is situated in the civil parish, approximately 1 mile and half ( 2 km) from the center of town.The town\'s tourism industry has flourished due to the high number of visitors.Other nearby attractions, such as the

Argentine Province districts.The city of Buenos Aires is not affiliated with either the Province of Argentina or its capital; however, it remains part of the province.Rather than something else, it is an autonomous district.Following decades of political strife, Buenos Aires was federalized and separated from the Province of Argentinea in 1880.Belgrano and Flores towns were added to the city\'s boundaries;The two areas have become part of the city\'s neighborhoods.The city was granted autonomy through the 1994 constitutional amendment, which led to its official name as the Ciudad Autónoma de

making it renowned for its diverse population and being considered one of the most diverse cities in Latin America.Catalan missionaries and Jesuits arrived in Cagliari (Sardinia) under the Spanish Crown after being captured from the Pisans in 1324 and established their headquarters on a hill that overlooked the city, as recorded in Aragonese\'s archives.The hill was called Buen Ayre by them, as it had no unpleasant odor unlike the surrounding castle and swamplands.During the siege of Cagliari, the Aragonese established a place of worship for the Virgin Mary on the hillside.King Alfonso the Gentle donated the church to the Mercedarians in 1335, who then built an abbey that still exists today.A story was circulated in the years that followed, claiming that a statue of the Virgin Mary was recovered from the Mediterranean Sea after it miraculously calmed quake.The abbey housed the statue.The image was revered by Spanish sailors, particularly Andalusians, who frequently invoked the "Fair Winds" to aid them in their navigation and prevent shipwrecks.Seville would later serve as a place of worship for the Virgin of Buen Ayre.Spanish sailors arrived at the River de la Plata during the first foundation of Buenos Aires with the blessing of "Santa Maria de los Argentinos" or simply "the Holy Virgin Mary of the Good Winds," who provided the wind that allowed them to reach the modern

applications.Annuals, biennials and perennials are all potential types of herbaceous plants.The complete death of annual herbaceous plants occurs at the end of their growing season or when they have flowered and produced fruit, followed by their regrowth from seed.The growth of herbaceous perennials and biennials may result in the death of their stems, but certain parts of the plant remain a part of it until the next season.The development of new growth can be attributed to the existence of roots, caudex, or underground stems.Carrot, parsnip, and common ragwort are all types of herbaceous biennials;The herbaceous perennials include potato, peony, hosta, mint, most ferns, and most grasses.In comparison, non-herbaceous perennials are woody plants that have stems above the ground that remain active during the winter season and produce shoots from above-ground areas in the following year. These include trees, shrubs, and vines.Certain herbaceous plants, particularly those that grow quickly, are early-successional or pioneering species.Many stable habitats are characterized by the presence of other vegetation, which can be found in the ground layer of forests or in naturally open environments like meadows, salt marshes and deserts.Certain herbaceous plants, like the banana

history is the examination and analysis of living organisms, such as animals, fungi, and plants, in their surroundings, with a focus on observation rather than experimental research.While scientific research is a part of it, it is not the only one, as science magazines are now more commonly used than academic journals to publish articles.The systematic study of natural phenomena and their organisms is known as natural history, which is a subset of the natural sciences.In a world filled with narrowly defined fields of study, the term is quite broad.Although natural history has its roots in ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Arabic cultures, it currently exists as a multidisciplinary field of study that blends various specialty fields.The multi-disciplinary approach of geobiology involves scientists who combine their knowledge of various fields of science.Naturalist or natural historian is the term used to describe someone who studies natural history.The English term natural history predates the 20th century and is derived from the Latin historia naturalis.Throughout time, the significance of this concept has gradually diminished while the interpretation of the related term "nature" has expanded (see History below).In ancient times, it referred to anything that was connected to nature or used natural resources.Pliny the Elder\'s encyclopedia, which was published between 77 and 79 AD, contains information on astronomy, geography, technology, medicine, superstition, animals, and plants.During the medieval period, European scholars categorized knowledge into two main categories: the humanities (now known as classics) and divinity, with science being conducted primarily through textual research rather than observation or experimentation.The study of nature was revived during the Renaissance and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge, which divided descriptive natural history and natural philosophy.In contemporary language, natural philosophy was analogous to modern physics and chemistry, while natural history encompassed the biological and geological sciences.The two were closely linked.The period of the gentleman scientist era was marked by numerous individuals contributing to both fields, and early papers in both were commonly read at professional science society meetings, such as the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences – both established in the seventeenth century.Linnaeus\' desire to improve the economic situation of Sweden was one of the practical reasons that motivated the encouragement of natural history.The Industrial Revolution prompted the development of geology to identify valuable mineral deposits.William Herschel, an astronomer, was also a natural historian.He opted to work with the stars instead of using plants or minerals.His attention was directed towards building telescopes for stargazing and observing the stars.Initially, he thought of a nebulae as an object, but eventually came to the realization that it was just another phase in the development of stars.Herschel\'s natural history is attributed to his observation of the natural world and his endeavor to grasp its meaning.He created charts of all the stars and kept records of everything he saw, while his sister Caroline was responsible for documenting it.The definition of natural history in the post-nineteenth century has been influenced by various fields and sources, with modern definitions often emphasizing a specific aspect of the field.Although natural history is commonly associated with observation and study, it can also be seen as a body of knowledge and practice that places more importance on the observer than on what they observe.The scientific study of individual organisms in their surroundings is often the focus of definitions from biologists, as Marston Bates\' definition suggests.The.The.The.The study of life at the individual level, including plant and animal behavior, their interactions with

explored and travelled since prehistoric times, oceanography is now a significant part of modern scientific study, dating back to the British Challenger expedition in the 1870s.The sea is typically split into up to five major oceanic regions, which include the four named by the IHO (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; this classification allows for multiple ocean

percentage may vary depending on the situation, such as in landlocked waters, near major rivers' mouths, or at deep water.Approximately 85 percent of the solids found in the open ocean are made up of sodium chloride.The formation of deep-sea currents is attributed to variations in salinity and temperature.Surface currents are created through the friction between wind and tides, as well as the local sea level changes due to the gravity of the Moon and Sun.The Coriolis effect and the Earth's rotation are responsible for directing the movement of surface and submarine land masses.Submerged shallow areas in the sea are known as continental shelves, which were left behind by past sea level fluctuations.Humans rely on the abundant nutrients in these fertile waters, which contain fish, shellfish, mammals, and seaweed that are both harvested from their wild origins and raised for consumption.The most diverse regions encircle exceptional tropical coral reefs.Whales were once abundant in the deep sea, but their numbers have decreased, leading to international conservation efforts and a moratorium on commercial hunting.Oceanography has revealed that the ecosystems of oceans are diverse, with nutrients from hydrothermal vents still providing support for life even at high pressures and depths.The origin of life may have occurred in that area, and the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere is often attributed to aquatic microbial mats.Plants and animals evolved in the ocean for the first time.Human trade, travel, mineral extraction, and power generation all rely on the sea.This has made it crucial to warfare and left major cities vulnerable to potential disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to nearby faults;Vigorous tsunami waves;Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones are all produced in the tropics.The duality and importance of human culture have impacted various aspects of its development, including early sea gods, epic poetry by Homer, and the effects of the Columbian Exchange.Leisure activities such as swimming, diving, surfing, and sailing are available at this location.Modern marine pollution is a result of population growth, industrial development, and intensive farming.Ocean acidification occurs when carbon dioxide is absorbed in increasing amounts, leading to a decrease in the pH of the ocean.Overfishing has become a growing issue due to the common nature of the sea.Old English has attributed both the sea and its two senses to the same thing;A definite article has been necessary for the larger sense since Early Middle English.The term has been used in practice for a long time, and there are no significant differences between seas and oceans, except for the Sargasso Sea, which is typically smaller and bounded

However, some individuals also believed that the River Don was the boundary between Europe and Asia.The eastern frontier of Europe was defined by geographer Strabo in the 1st century, at the River Don.The Book of Jubilees portrayed the continents as the land that Noah gave to his three sons;From the Pillars of Hercules in Gibraltar, which serve as a boundary between Europe and North Africa, to the Don, that serves as an extension of Asia, Europe was defined by definition.']], [[110, "what is the name of jay-z and beyonce's daughter?", 'The American rapper, entrepreneur, investor and stage

The BBC was established on 1 January 1927 by Royal Charter to produce publicly funded programming while remaining independent from government management and funding.The license was initially referred to as a wireless license.In certain countries, the introduction of television led to the issuance of a separate additional television license, while others increased the radio licence fee to cover the extra cost of TV broadcasting, renaming the license from radio or receiver licences.Most countries today pay for public radio broadcasting with the same licence fee used for television, although some still have their own radio licences or charge consumers lower or no fees for only having a radio.In some countries, users are charged different fees for colour or monochrome TV.A lot of businesses offer discounts or do not charge for services to elderly and/or disabled customers.In order to combat licence fee evasion, some countries opt to finance public broadcasters through taxation or other less avoidable channels such as co-pay with electricity billing.Supplementary advertising is also carried by national public broadcasters in certain countries.The Council of Europe established the European Convention on Transfrontier Television in 1989, which regulates advertising standards, time, and break format, but also has an indirect impact on licensing.7 member states ratified the treaty, which resulted in its entry into force in 1993.It has been accepted by 34 countries.The Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago notes that television licences are used to finance public television in two-thirds of European countries and half of Asia and Africa.The licensing of TV in the Americas is mainly restricted to French overseas departments and British Overseas Territories.Radio receiver licenses in certain countries are used to finance radio channels and broadcasters' web sites, enabling them to access their content without any commercial advertising.The implementation and actual cost of the television license vary widely from country to country.The remaining portion of this section pertains to the license fee in various countries across the globe.The Albanian license fee for Europe Albania is 800 lek (€5).The number of days per year is 81.The public broadcaster RTSh receives only a small portion of its funding from the licence fee.The government provides 58 percent of the RTSh funding through taxes, while the remaining 42% comes from commercials and the licence fee.The Austria RGG requires the registration of all broadcasting reception

mountainous and partly lawless province of nuristan lies in the north-east of which country?', 'Nuristan, which is also known as Nooristan or Nurestan in the east, is one of the 34 provinces in Afghanistan.The population of the region, which is divided into seven districts, is estimated to be 140,900.Parun is the capital of the province.Until the inhabitants converted to Islam in 1895, Kafiristan ( land of the undead \'\') was the original name for the area, which has since been changed to Nuristans (literally: "land of light").Agriculture, animal husbandry, and day labor are the primary occupations.Nuristan is situated on the southern slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains in the northeastern part of India, where it stretches over the Alingar, Pech, Landai Sin, and Kunar rivers basins.To the south of Nuristan are Laghman and Kunar provinces, while Badakhshan province borders the north, Panjshir province to the west, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan is located on the eastern side.In the early history of the area, Alexander the Great conquered it in 330 B.A.Chandragupta Maurya was the one who took control of it.The Mauryas brought Hinduism and Buddhism to the area and were attempting to expand their empire to Central Asia until they encountered Greco-Bactrian opposition.According to reports, Seleucus and Chandragupta came to an agreement for peace, which involved inseparating the Mauryas from Malayalam and offering 500 elephants as their share of ownership.Chandragupta consolidated his power in the northwest and then moved towards the Nanda Empire.The archaeological discoveries in Afghanistan provide a comprehensive record of the country\'s ancient, physical, and non-physical Buddhist heritage, including religious and artistic remains.During the period of 563 BCE to 483 B CE, Xuanzang documented that Buddhist doctrines had a presence as far back as Balkh.Kafiristan was historically known for its Nuristani people, who were a unique ethnic group that followed ancient Hinduism.The Nuristani people\'s conversion to Islam began in the late 1800s when Emir Abdur Rahman Khan conquered their community.According to British missionaries, the area was renamed Nuristan, which means Land of the enlightened, reflecting the pagan Nurionists being  light-hearted due to Islam.It was previously believed that Alexander the Great marched through Nuristan with a division of his army;The Nuristani people are believed to have descended from Alexander, as per folk legend.Abdul Wakil Khan Nuristani is considered a significant historical figure in Nuritan\'s history.He resisted the British-led Punjabi army and expelled them from the eastern provinces of Afghanistan.The same plateau where King Amanullah Khan is buried is where he was interred.The re-annexation of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of what is now Pakistan has been a major concern for Afghan politicians, including Mohammed Daoud Khan, since the establishment of Pakistan in 1947.Militancy has emerged on both sides of the Durand Line due to this.In the meantime, Pakistani politicians have been focusing on connecting what is now Tajikistan to Pakistan.To undermine Afghan control in Nuristan and Badakhshan provinces, it is necessary to provide clandestine funding for anti-Afghan rebel groups.During the Soviet war in the 1980s, Nuristan witnessed some of the most intense guerrilla fighting in history.Mawlawi Afzal\'s Islamic Revolutionary State of Afghanistan had an impact on the province, as it received support from Pakistan nationalists and Saudi Arabia.The Taliban\'s rule in the late 1990s led to the dissolution of the organization.Nuristan is among the most rural and impoverished regions in Afghanistan.The Taliban insurgency and inadequate road safety have resulted in a scarcity of non-governmental organizations in Nuristan.The United States and the Afghan government are working to resolve these issues.Road construction ventures were started that connected Nangarej to Mandol and Chapa Dara to Titan Dar.In order to decrease the dependence on roads from Kunar province to the rest of Afghanistan, the Afghan government worked on a direct road route to Laghman province.']], [[114, 'name the private gardens adjoining windsor castle which housed the royal mausoleum, the burial place of queen victoria and prince albert?', "The royal family's home, Windsor Castle, is located in the English county of Berkshire.The building's architecture and its long-standing connection with the English and British royal family are what make it noteworthy.The first castle was erected in the 11th century following the Norman conquest of England by William the Conqueror.It has been in use by every king since Henry I's reign, and is the palace with the highest number of rooms in Europe.The State Apartments, a luxurious collection of rooms from the castle's early 19th century, were described by art historian Hugh Roberts as an exceptional example of the finest expression of Georgian design.Historian John Martin Robinson considers the 15th-century St George's Chapel, built inside the castle walls, to be one of the most important examples of English Perpendicular Gothic design.The original purpose of Windsor Castle was to safeguard Norman authority on the outskirts of London and manage a crucial section of the River Thames, but it was later converted into tenth-century motte-and-bailey castle with three wards surrounding essentially the same mound.The castle was gradually replaced by stone fortifications, and it managed to withstand a prolonged siege during the First Barons' War in the early 13th century.During the middle of the century, Henry III constructed a grand royal palace within the castle, while his son Edward III rebuilt the palace to create an even more impressive set of structures, making it the most expensive secular building project in England during the Middle Ages.The castle's core design persisted during the Tudor era, as Henry VIII and Elizabeth I utilized it as a royal court and diplomatic entertainment center.The tumultuous English Civil War persisted at Windsor Castle, which was utilized as a military base for Parliamentary forces and incarcerated for Charles I.During the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II collaborated with Hugh May to rebuild Windsor Castle and create lavish Baroque interiors that are still highly regarded.The State Apartments, which feature Rococo, Gothic, and Baroque furnishings, were created by George III and George IV after a period of neglect in the 18th century when they renovated and rebuilt Charles II's palace.During Queen Victoria's reign, the castle was transformed into a hub for royal entertainment, with only minor modifications being made.During the Luftwaffe bombing campaigns in World War II, Windsor Castle was used as a refuge for the royal family and managed to burn down in 1992.A popular tourist spot, a venue for hosting state visits and the preferred weekend dwelling of Elizabeth II.The world's largest inhabited castle, Windsor Castle, is home to more than 500 individuals who live and work there.The architecture of Windsor Castle combines the features of a fortification, palace, and small town.A series of phases were used to build the current castle, with the reconstruction work being the final stage after a fire in 1992.The design is essentially Georgian and Victorian, drawing inspiration from a medieval site, with Gothic elements brought back to life.The castle's architecture has been striving to reflect a modern interpretation of traditional styles and traditions, frequently replicating outdated or even antiquated ones since the 14th century.Despite the late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures, Windsor Castle's architecture has been identified by Sir William Whitfield as having an imaginary quality that gives it the feel of being staged for such a performance.The castle's architecture and history have been criticized, but it still ranks among the best palaces in Europe.In the middle of Windsor Castle, there is a bailey that surrounds the motte or artificial hill in the center known as the Middle Ward.The motte, which is 50 ft tall, was originally constructed from chalk that was dug from the nearby ditch."]], [[115, "what does mexican coke have that american coke doesn't?", 'Coca-Cola that is made in Mexico and imported into the United States is known as Mexican Coke or MexiCoke.Although

distinct taste due to its use of cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, comparing to other soft drinks with the same formula, one scientific study found that Mexican Coke had similar levels of fructosic and glucose.Coca-Cola asserts that Mexican Coke exported to the United States is made with cane sugar, but some Mexican bottlers may use high-fructose corn syrup for drinks intended for sale in Mexico.Hence, Coca-Cola in the U. labeled Mexico as " Mexican".S.Not all Coca-Cola sold in Mexico is made from cane sugar.Grupo Tampico was established by History Coca-Cola in the 1920s as its first bottling plant, followed by ARMA.The largest Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico, along with most of Latin America, is FEMSA, a company located in Monterrey.A Mexican Coca-Cola bottler declared in 2013 that it would discontinue the use of cane sugar and switch to glucose-fructose syrup.It was later revealed that the bottles, particularly those exported to the United States as Coca-Cola Nostalgia products, would not be impacted by this alteration.Taste tests yielded mixed results.A local Westchester, New York magazine conducted a taste test and discovered that the Mexican Coke had \'an incomparable flavor with an unbearably spicy and herbal aroma, along with traces of root beer or old-fashioned sarsaparilla candies.American Coca-Cola was the overwhelming choice for participants in a separate double-blind taste test.Taste tests conducted by Coca-Cola revealed no discernible differences in the flavor of American Coke and the Mexican formulation.A thick glass bottle, measuring 355 ml or 500 mm, is used to bottle Mexican Coke, which has been described as having a more refined and nostalgic appearance, unlike the plastic American Co. bottles.A label made of enamel is applied to the glass bottle, replacing the one with a vinyl wrap around plastic.To comply with U.S. regulations, Mexican Coke exporters typically use a paper sticker that includes nutrition facts labeling, ingredients, and contact information for the importer and exporter.S.Food labelling stipulations.U.S.The World of Coca-Cola offers Mexican Coke in its gift store, and it is now widely available in

Wars, was a global conflict that occurred between 28 July 1914 and 11 November 1918 in Europe.One of the most significant wars in history saw the mobilization of more than 70 million military personnel, with 60 million of them being Europeans.The belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, combined with the tactical stalemate created by grueling trench warfare, resulted in a casualty rate of over 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians, including victims of multiple genocides.The conflict was one of the bloodiest in history and paved the way for significant political transformations, including revolutions in many countries that were involved.The world's economic great powers were involved in the war, resulting from two opposing alliances formed by the Allies and the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary.The Triple Alliance included Italy, Germany, and Austria-Hungary, but Italy did not become a member due to their offensive against the alliance.The Allies were joined by Italy, Japan, and the United States, while the Central Powers were aided by the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria.The war was triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the successor to the Austria-Hungarian throne, by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914.The diplomatic situation erupted into chaos as Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia and instigated the use of international alliances that had been established for several decades.The war between the major powers was declared in a matter of weeks, and it quickly spread worldwide.The Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia on 28 July.As Russia stepped in to assist Serbia, Germany invaded neutral Belgian and Luxembourg-speaking areas before moving towards France, prompting the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany.The Western Front was plunged into a battle of attrition after the German march on Paris was halted, with little progress made until 1917.The Russian army achieved success against the Austro-Hungarians on the Eastern Front, but the Germans prevented their invasion of East Prussia.In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire became a member of the Central Powers and established military bases in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and Sinai.In 1915, Italy and Bulgaria became members of the Allies and the Central Power respectively;The Allies welcomed Romania in 1916 and the United States in 1917.In March 1917, the Russian government disintegrated, and in November, a revolution brought the local population to terms with the Central Powers through the Treaty of Brest Litovsk, which was an enormous German triumph.Following a stunning German attack on the Western Front in 1918, the Allies executed dozens of successful offensives to drive back the Germans.The Austro-Hungarian empire concluded an armistice on 4 November 1918, and Germany, which was struggling with revolutionaries, ended the war on 11 November 1917, resulting in a victory for the Allies.At the end of the war, the German Empire, Russian Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire were all eliminated.National boundaries were redrawn, independent nations were established or revived, and the colonies of Germany were distributed among the conquerors.The Big Four, consisting of Britain, France, the United States, and Italy, imposed their terms in a series of treaties during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919.The League of Nations was established to prevent any future conflict from occurring.The failure of this endeavor, coupled with economic hardship, the revival of European nationalism, weakened member states, and the German sense of shame, played a role in the rise of Nazism.The occurrence of these conditions eventually led to the outbreak of World War II.Starting with the French Revolution and ending with Germany, the First World War was referred to as the Great War or the Third Reich from 1918 to 1945."]], [[117, 'what was mumbai formerly called?', "Mumbai (;The capital city of Maharashtra, also known as Bombay, was the official name of the state until 1995.The city has an estimated

later transferred to British East India Company when King Charles II married Catherine of Braganza in 1661. As a part of her inheritance, Charles was given access to Tangier and seven islands of Bombay.The Hornby Vellard project, which aimed to recover the area between the seven islands from the sea, was responsible for the redevelopment of Bombay in the mid-18th century.The completion of the reclamation project in 1845, along with the construction of major roads and railways, transformed Bombay into a significant seaport on the Arabian Sea.In the 19th century, Bombay experienced a surge in economic and educational advancements.The Indian independence movement gained a strong foothold in the early 20th century.After India gained independence in 1947, the city was assimilated into Bombay State.Following the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, a new state was formed in Mahathala with Bombay as its capital in 1960.Mumbai is the primary destination for financial, commercial, and entertainment ventures in India.It is ranked among the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow, with a total output of 6.India's economy is boosted by 70% of capital transactions, 25% of GDP, and industrial output.The city is home to major financial institutions such as the Reserve Bank of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange, and the National Stock exchange of Indian.

designated as a National Park on November 12, 1971.The geology of the national park is centered on an underground evaporite layer or salt bed, which is responsible for the formation of arches, spires, balanced rocks, and eroded monoliths.The salt bed in the Paradox Basin of the Colorado Plateau was deposited some 300 million years ago, when a sea flowed into the region and eventually evaporated, with areas measuring thousands of feet in thickness.Debris eroded from the Uncompahgre Uplift to the northeast covered the salt bed over an extended period of millions of years.The Early Jurassic period saw the emergence of the vast Navajo Sandstone, which was subject to the most favorable desert conditions in the region.The Entrada Sandstone, which was formed over the Navajo, is a sequence of stream-laying and windblown sediments that date back to approximately 140 million years ago.More than 5000 feet ( 1500 m) of younger sediments were deposited, and they are mostly being worn away.The Cretaceous Mancos Shale exposures are among the remains of the cover in the area.Entrada formation forms the majority of the area's arches.Eugene P. and Kiver, respectively.David V.Harris, an expert in the field of geology at U.S.S.The 5th edition of Wiley's Parklands.The 1999 p.The salt bed was pushed up by layers of rock into salt domes due to the weight of the cover, which caused the material to melt.The evaporites in the vicinity created more irregular salt anticlines or linear uplift zones.Fault was discovered and the rock subsided into the areas between the domes.In certain areas, they were almost erect.The Moab Fault, which is a 2500 ft displacement, can be observed from the visitor center.The movement of saltwater through the landscape led to the erosion and removal of younger rock layers.With the exception of isolated remains, the park's primary formations that can be seen today are the Entrada Sandstone, which has a salmon hue, and the buff Navajo Sand stone.Layered cakes of these can be found in most areas of the park.Water gradually penetrated the surface cracks, joints, and folds of these layers.The expansion of ice into the fissures caused it to expand and exert pressure on the surrounding rock, resulting in the separation of pieces.The wind eventually swept away any remaining particles.A set of unmodified fins persisted.The fins were subjected to the force of wind and water until certain cementing material collapsed and rock chunks fell out.A large number of broken fins fell.Some individuals, with the appropriate level of toughness and balance, managed to survive despite their missing pieces.These transformed into the renowned arches.The park's terrain may seem rugged and sturdy, but it is actually quite the opposite.The high desert ecosystem is at risk due to over 700,000 visitors annually.The problem is situated in the soil's crust, which is made up of cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens that thrive in dusty areas of the park.The semiarid conditions, unpredictable rainfall, lack of deep freezing, and absence of plant material in the soil make Arches National Park vulnerable to visitor damage.The soil crust index, water infiltration measurement, and t-tests are all ways to indicate the effects on the soil, with the latter being used to compare values between undisturbed and disturbed areas."]], [[119, 'steve martin and which

a gunshot.The sole solicitor general or attorney general to have served as prime minister was him, who was also in the throne of the sovereign under whom he reigned from 1760 to 1820.Perceval, the younger son of an Irish earl, was educated at both Harrow School and Trinity College in Cambridge.At Lincoln's Inn, he studied law and later worked as a barrister on the Midland circuit. He was appointed as King'S Counsel in 1796 and then began his political career at the age of 33, when parliamentary representation was formed for Northampton.William Pitt was the source of Perceval's admiration, and he never considered himself a Tory.Catholic emancipation and Parliament reform were met with resistance from Perceval;He supported the fight against Napoleon and the cessation of the slave trade.He had a distaste for hunting, gambling, and adultery, as well as being less likely to drink than the majority of Parliament members. He also gave generously to charity and spent time with his twelve children.His political involvement was delayed, but he quickly gained power;The Addington Ministry was his first post as solicitor and attorney general, followed by the Portland Ministry as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader ofthe House of Commons before he became prime minister in October 1809.During his time as the head of a fragile ministry, Perceval was confronted with several crises, including an examination of the Walcheren expedition, King George III's mental state, economic hardship, and Luddite rebellions.He managed to overcome crises, successfully pursued the Peninsular War despite opposition defeatism, and gained support from the Prince Regent.His position had become more prominent by the spring of 1812, when he was assassinated by John Bellingham, a merchant who had criticized the government and shot him dead in the House of Commons' lobby.Despite having four older brothers who lived to adulthood, Perceval's seventh son was the Earldom of Egmont, which had been in his great-grandsons' hands until its disappearance in 2011.The seventh son of John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont, was born in Audley Square, Mayfair during his childhood and early education; he is known for his devotion to public speaking and the arts.The Earl's second marriage resulted in him being the second son.The 4th Earl of Northampton had a granddaughter named Catherine Compton, who went by the name Baroness Arden.Spencer was a member of the Compton household;Spencer Compton, the 1st Earl of Wilmington and great uncle of Catherine Compote, served as the prime minister.A political advisor to Frederick, Prince of Wales, and King George III, his father served as First Lord of the Admiralty in the Cabinet for a short time.During his childhood, Perceval spent most of his life at Charlton House, which was taken by his father to be located near Woolwich docks.At the age of eight, Perceval's father passed away.During his time at Harrow School, Perceval was a hardworking and disciplined student.At Harrow, he became interested in evangelical Anglicanism and formed a lifelong friendship with Dudley Ryder.He moved to Trinity College, Cambridge, with his older brother Charles after five years at Harrow, where he won the declamation prize in English and graduated in 1782.Due to his second marriage and a meager annual allowance of only £200, which was around £28,000 in 2014, Perceval had to find ways to manage his career and family.He opted for law as a profession, attended Lincoln's Inn, and was granted admission to the bar in 1786.After the death of their mother in 1783, Perceval and his brother Charles, who is now Lord Arden, rented a house in Charlton.

official language of government and business is French.Prior to the late 19th century, Burkina Faso was governed by different ethnic groups, including the Mossi kingdoms, before it was conquered by the French and other colonial powers.The country underwent many changes in its governance following its independence from France in 1960.Blaise Compaoré was the country's most recent president, serving from 1987 until he was removed by the popular youth upheaval of 31 October 2014.From October 2014 to September 2015, a semi-presidential republic was established.The Regiment of Presidential Security initiated a military coup on 17 September 2015, which resulted in the downfall of the provisional government.Michel Kafando was reinstated as acting President on 24 September 2015 after the military junta agreed to resign due to pressure from the African Union, ECOWAS, and the armed forces.The northwestern region of Burkina Faso was occupied by hunter-gatherers from 14,000 to 5000 BC in the prehistoric era.Archeological excavations conducted in 1973 revealed the discovery of scrapers, chisels, and arrowheads, among other tools.Agriculture flourished in settlements established between 3600 and 2600 BC.An Iron-Age society, the Bura culture was based in the southwest region of present-day Niger and the southeast area of contemporary Burkina Faso.The smelting and forging of iron for tools and weapons were the primary focus of the industry in Sub-Saharan Africa by 1200 BC.The exact dates of the arrival of various ethnic groups in Burkina Faso are disputed by early history historians.The Proto-Mossi were among the first to arrive in the far eastern part of Burkina Faso during the 8th to 11th centuries, while Samo, Dogon, and other ethnic groups arrived in different areas.The Mossi created several kingdoms during the Middle Ages, including Tenkodogo, Yatenga, Gourma, Zandoma and Ouagadougou.The Battle of Kobi in Mali in 1483 saw Sonni Ali of Songhai emerge victorious over the Mossi who had invaded Timbuktu between 1328 and 1338.In the early 16th century, the Songhai carried out numerous slave raids in Burkina Faso.The Black Volta was home to ethnic groups such as the Dyan, Lobi, and Birifor during the 18th century, which saw the establishment of the Gwiriko Empire in Bobo Dioulasso.From the 1890s to 1958, British, French, and German military officers made efforts to assert their ownership over parts of Burkina Faso.The colonialists and their troops occasionally engaged in battles against the native populations;At times, they established treaties and alliances with them.The colonial officers and their home governments also entered into treaties with each other.Burkina Faso underwent a complex transformation and was granted French protection in 1896.The French occupied the eastern and western regions in 1897, where the presence of powerful Samori Ture forces made the situation more complicated.By 1898, the majority of Burkina Faso's land had been formally conquered;The French's hold on several regions was uncertain.The Franco-British Convention of 14 June 1898 established the current borders of the country.A war of conquest against local communities and political powers occurred in the French territory for approximately five years."]], [[129, 'in which county would you find chesil beach?', 'Chesil Beach, also known as Cheshire Bank, is one of the three major shingle structures in Britain and is located in southern England.The term stems from the Old English word ceosel, which means "gravelous" or "shingle", and derives its name from this root.While being often confused with tombolo, the physical characteristics of the beach have led researchers to suggest that it is a barrier beach.The beach is composed of shingle that measures 29 km in length, 200 m in width, and 15 mm in height.The Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is home to the beach and Fleet, which were featured in Ian McEwan\'s 2007 novel, On Chesil Beach.The Isle of Portland\'s cliffs and the eastern end of the beach in Chiswell village give rise to Chesil Cove, which is formed by a sharp curve.The low village is safeguarded from flooding by this section of the beach.The beach, which has been the location of numerous shipwrecks, was named "Dead Man\'s Bay" by Thomas Hardy.The Fleet, a shallow tidal lagoon, is enclosed by the shingle that forms curved lines along the coast towards the west.The town of Weymouth and the village of Chiswell on Portland are shielded by the beach, which offers protection from the strong winds and waves.As the Bank continues to grow taller and higher above mean high water, the flint and chert shingle range in size from pea-sized near West Bay to orange-size near Portland\'s south-east end.The size of the shingle is believed to be a crucial factor in determining where smugglers land on the beach during the night, according to reports.The beach is owned by three people;From Portland to Littlesea, the Crown Estates possess the beach.The Ilchester Estates, based north of Dorchester and with a local office in Abbotsbury, own the majority of Upper Fleet to West Bexington and the lagoon bed and Chesil Beach adjacent to the Fleet.The National Trust is the owner of it, stretching from West Bexington to West Bay.Chesil Beach, situated south of the Portland Bound Stone, is a registered common land area that allows public access on foot.The origin of Chesil Beach has been a topic of debate for some time.The Budleigh Salterton pebble beds were initially thought to be the source of beach material, but it was later discovered to come from Portland in the south east.The difference in pebbles on the beach from nearby sources is believed to be due to the Flandrian isostatic sea level rise, which could also make it a barrier beach or bar rather than \'true\' tombolo.The occurrence of tombolos is usually due to the impact of the island\'s waves and sediment movement, which results in a beach that is perpendicular to its surroundings rather than parallel to them.Fleet shores and Chesil Beach are both prone to the formation of fossils.The central location is in Burton Bradstock.Chesil Beach has a rich history of shipwrecks, especially in the age of sail.During gale-like weather in the south-west, the beach was at risk due to its extended lee shore created by storms from the English Channel.For safety, a vessel traveling across the Channel had to clear Portland Bill before being pushed northward into Lyme Bay due to the force of wind and tide.During the period when sailing ships were prevalent, there was a robust network of coast guards stationed along the beach, including lookouts and cottages in Chiswell, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Langton Herring, Abbotsbury, East Bexington, Burton Bradstock, and West Bay.Currently, there are no manned stations on the beach, as the Portland Coastguard provides coverage when necessary.The fishermen of Portland and the surrounding area constructed a vessel to endure the rough seas at Chesil Beach.']], [[130, 'on which scottish island was former labour party leader john smith laid to

as a junior minister for Energy and the Privy Council Office, Smith entered Parliament in 1970. He then joined the Cabinet at the end of James Callaghan\'s term, where he served as Secretary of State for Trade and President of the Board of Trade from 1978 to 1979.During his tenure as an Opposition member to Margaret Thatcher\'s Conservative government, he progressed through the Shadow Cabinet and held various positions such as Shadow Secretary of State for Trade, Shadow secretary of state for Energy, or Shadow secretion for employment.The Party\'s unexpected defeat in the 1992 general election led to the resignation of Labour leader Neil Kinnock, and Smith was chosen as his replacement in July 1992.Kinnock\'s efforts to reform Labour were sustained by his replacement of the trade union block vote with  one member, one vote" at the 1993 party conference.Despite being labeled as another example of caution, his cautious approach to reform was designed to avoid controversy and secure victory in the next election by capitalizing on the unpopularity of the Conservative government.The death of Smith in May 1994 caused frustration among modernizers, including Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Following his unexpected death, Blair took over as Leader and successfully renamed Labour as New Labour, winning the 1997 general election.The son of a headmaster, Smith was born in Dalmally, Argyll, but spent his early life growing up in Ardrishaig.He attended Dunoon Grammar School, stayed with a landlady in the town and returned home during the holidays. He then went on to study History at the University of Glasgow from 1956 to 1959, and Law again from 1959 to 1962.He became a member of the Labour Party in 1956.He participated in debates with the Glasgow University Dialectic Society and the Scottish University Union.He was the winner of The Observer Mace debating competition in 1962, while conversing with Gordon Hunter.The John Smith Memorial Mace was the new name given to the competition in 1995 after his death.Smith worked as a solicitor for ten years following graduation.The Faculty of Advocates, which is equivalent to being called to the bar in Scotland, was where he was elected.Smith was a member of Parliament who ran for parliamentary seat in the 1961 by-election for Labour in East Fife;He ran for office in that seat again during the 1964 general election.He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for North Lanarkshire in the 1970 general election, succeeding Margaret Herbison.Smith resisted the Labour whips in 1971 by joining Roy Jenkins\' Labour MPs who supported entry to the European Economic Community.Roy Hattersley, Shirley Williams, Bill Rodgers, and David Owen were among the members of the Callaghan cabinet with whom he later sided.In October 1974, Harold Wilson extended an invitation to Smith to become the Solicitor General for Scotland.Smith declined, stating that he didn\'t want his career as a police officer to be taken for granted.Instead, he was appointed as the Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Energy.December 1975 saw him being appointed as a Minister of State.Following James Callaghan\'s appointment as Prime Minister, Smith was appointed as a Minister of State at the Privy Council Office, where he worked alongside Michael Foot, the Lord President of the Council and Leader ofthe House of Commons.Smith was in charge of piloting the House of Commons\' devolution plans for Scotland and Wales, which were highly controversial.The adeptness Smith demonstrated in managing these proposals was admired by Callaghan, who appointed him Secretary of State for Trade in November 1978 upon Edmund Dell\'s retirement.']], [[131, '"which 16th century venetian, born jacopo robusti, studied under titian and painted ""st george and the dragon"", ""belshazzar\'s feast"", ""the last supper"" and ""paradise""?"', 'According to the Gospel accounts, Jesus had his Last Supper with his Apostles in Jerusalem before he was crucified.Maundy Thursday is a significant day for Christians to honor the Last Supper.This meal is the scriptural basis for the Eucharist, which can also be referred to as "Holy Communion" or "The Lord\'s Supper."In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, the Last Supper is mentioned for the first time.The Last Supper was mentioned in the four canonical Gospels as taking place towards the end of the week, following Jesus\' triumphal entrance into Jerusalem. Just before his crucified apostles, Jesus and his Apostles had a meal together.During the meal, Jesus foretells that he will be betrayed by an Apostle who was present, and Peter will refuse to acknowledge him until the next day.Jesus\' Eucharist, which involves breaking bread and giving it to the Apostles in the First Epistle to Corinthians, is recounted in all three Synoptic Gospels.Although not present in the Gospel of John, it tells of Jesus washing the feet of the Apostles, giving a new commandment to love one another as much as I loved you, and concluding with eloquent farewell speeches, in which he addresses the followers of his teachings as friends rather than servants.Early Christian Eucharist practices have been traced back to the Last Supper by scholars.The Last Supper\'s story is considered by some to have been influenced by the eucharistic customs of the 1st century, as suggested by Funk and Robert W.The Jesus Seminar.The quest for the genuine actions of Jesus.HarperSan Francisco.1998.The opening line, p.The mid-50s were Paul\'s description of 1-40.The Last Supper had a dual purpose of commemorating Passover, freeing Jewish people from slavery in Egypt, and introducing Christianity.In The Gospel according to Luke, Volume 28, Part 1 by Joseph A., the term Last Supper is not present in the New Testament.Despite the availability of information in Fitzmyer\'s 1995 book, ISBN 0-385-00515-6 page 1378, many Christians still refer to Jesus\' last meal with his Apostles as the "Last Supper."The term "Lord\'s Supper" is commonly used by Protestants, who argue that the last title implies a meal rather than the actual one.The term  Lord\'s Supper is used to describe both the biblical event and the religious celebration known as Holy Communion and thanksgiving.While Evangelical Protestants use the term "Lord\'s Supper," they do not typically refer to the Eucharist or Holy Communion.Bard Thompson\'s book Humanists and Reformers (1996), ISBN 978-0-8028-6348-5 pages 493-494 uses the term "Mystical Supper" to refer to both the biblical event and the Eucharistic celebration in Eastern Orthodox liturgy.Based on Scripture, the last meal that Jesus had with his disciples is documented in all four canonical Gospels.The Last Supper was the name given to this meal.The Last Supper, a ritual that recounted the events of Jesus\' last meal among the early Christian community, was probably retold in 2005. Erwin Fahlbusch\'s book, Volume 4 of The Encyclopedia of Christianity, ISBN 978-0-8028-2416-5 pages 52-56, details this event.In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul mentions the Last Supper in his introduction rather than giving a detailed account of what actually took place during the meal.Craig A.\'s Bible Knowledge Background Commentary.The Last Supper, which takes place at the end of the week, is based on the story of Jesus and his disciples sharing a meal after the Triumphal entry into Jerusalem and encountering Jewish elders.']], [[132, 'which french actor features on the cover on the smiths album the queen is dead', 'The Queen Is Dead is the third studio album released by the Smiths, an English rock band.The release date of the album was 16 June 1986 by Rough Trade Records in the UK and 23 June by Sire Records, the United States.The album topped the UK Albums Chart after twenty two weeks, reaching number two.It achieved the 28th position on the RPM 100 album chart in Canada, the 70th spot on its Billboard 200 chart, and was granted Gold certification by the RIAA in late 1990.Ever since its release, it has sold well and received unanimous critical acclaim, with NME ranking it as the best album of all time in 2013.While touring Britain in early 1985, the Smiths worked with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce on soundchecks while also writing songs that would later be included on The Queen Is Dead.The title of the album is derived from Hubert Selby, Jr\'s novel " Last Exit to Brooklyn".The.It is possible that the album title is a reference to Macbeth, where Seyton informs the title character of his wife\'s murder (literally, "the queen, my Lord") and mentions her death.The title could also imply a scene in Cymbeline where the doctor, Cornelius, tells the king, Cymymbelés, that the queen had died.Marr characterized " The Boy with the Thorn in His Side" as an uncomplicated musical work that was composed during its springtime tour of 1985.Allegory: The lyrics in the song alludes to the band\'s experience in a music industry that did not appreciate it.Morrissey dubbed this song as his favourite of the Smiths in 2003.In the summer of 1985, Marr posted a demo of the music for "Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others" through Morrissey\'s letterbox.Morrissey subsequently completed the song by adding lyrics.Marr has revealed that he had a preference for the music over the lyrics.Honestly, Mr.In the late summer of 1985, Morrissey and Marr wrote Shankly songs during a writing session at their home in Bowdon, Greater Manchester.The first one is believed to have been sent to Geoff Travis, who leads Rough Trade, the record label of the Smiths.Travis has characterized the song as humorous, discussing Morrissey\'s desire to shift to another location. He also admitted that there was a line in the track that mentioned " bloody awful poetry" and referenced he had written for Morrissian.The New York Dolls\' lyrics for " There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" are taken from the song "Lonely Planet Boy".Upon hearing it for the first time, Marr thought that this song was the best one she\'d ever heard.The Velvet Underground\'s  There She Goes Again\'uses the guitar section from Marvin Gaye and the Rolling Stones\' cover of their song - Hitch Hike.The music for "Never Had No One Ever" was completed in August 1985, and it was based on a demo that Marr had recorded in December 1984. The demo was inspired by the Stooges\' song "I Need Somebody."Marr believes that the song\'s mood perfectly captures the album and its recording process.According to the song, Morrissey\'s lyric conveys his sense of danger and being from an immigrant family, not residing in Manchester.The Boy with the Thorn in His Side, Bigmouth Strikes Again and Frankly, Mr.The Queen Is Dead and  There Ignited Out\' were both featured on the live tour of Scotland in September and October, where Shankly debuted their songs.A song that Marr started writing as a teenager and later became known as " The Queen is Dead" was the inspiration behind it.']], [[133, "quantrill's raiders, a loosely organised force of partisan rangers under the leadership of william clarke quantril, fought in which war?", "Among the pro-Confederate partisan rangers who served in the American Civil War, Quantrill's Raiders were the most famous.Jesse James and his brother Frank were part of the group that was led by William Quantrill.At the start of the war, Missouri and Kansas, which were nominally under Union control, had become a hub of banditry, with Confederate bushwhackers and anti-slavery Jayhawkers fighting for dominance.The city of Lawrence, Kansas, known for its anti-slavery stance, had prohibited the men of Quantrill and imprisoned some of their young female captives.The town was the site of a furious attack by Quantrill in August 1863, which resulted in the deaths of more than 180 civilians. This was done allegedly as retaliation for the casualties caused when the women's prison had collapsed, and it is believed to have been intentional.The Confederate government, which had given Quantrill a field commission under the Partisan Ranger Act, was incensed and terminated support for these irregular forces.The group was fragmented into small bands by 1864 due to Quantrill's loss of control over them.Several individuals, including Quantrill, lost their lives in different engagements.Many people continued to hold reunions and recollections of events after the name Quantrill's Raiders was introduced.The Missouri-Kansas border region was a favorable location for the outbreak of guerrilla warfare during the Civil War in 1861.The statewide convention of secession was rejected by Missouri voters in February 1861, as stated by historian Albert Castel.The unionists, headed by the regular U.S.S.The political and military control of the state was contested by both the Blair family, led by Claiborne Jackson and Sterling Price, and pro-secessionist forces.Union troops and Confederate soldiers engaged in open battle by June.The state witnessed immediate guerrilla warfare, which escalated in August after the Union's loss at the Battle of Wilson'S Creek.The Battle of Pea Ridge in August 1862 resulted in the Union's victory, leaving the state without significant Confederate troops, but the violence in Missouri persisted.The situation in the state after Wilson's Creek is described in a historical work, with William Clarke Quantrill leading the most notorious guerrilla group.Quantrill's methodical and legal status did not prevent him from becoming the only Confederate guerrilla operating in Missouri, but he quickly gained the most fame.He and his group attacked Union patrols and supply convoys, pillaged mail, and sometimes targeted small towns on both sides of the Kansas-Missouri border.Reflecting on the guerrilla warfare in Missouri, Quantrill directed his efforts towards suppressing pro-Union civilians and driving them out of the area where he operated.The Jayhawkers, Union troops, and U.S. were attacked by Quantrill's guerrillas.S.The main focus of the forces is on ambush and assault.During his tenure, the Confederate guerrillas perfected military tactics such as covert disguises, coordinated and synchronized attacks, pre-planned routes and horse relays for dispersal, and technical methods, including the use of multiple horses.To improve both firepower and accuracy, Colt revolvers with 36 caliber are used.The weapon is of 44 calibre.Quantrill was appointed as a field captain in the Confederate army under the Partisan Act during his conquest and later became eligible for the Civil War Induction.Other officers were chosen by the men.Quantrill frequently referred to himself as a colonel.Quantrill's actions were often self-involved, as the Confederate government had assumed legal responsibility.The Lawrence Massacre, a revenge operation against Lawrence, Kansas in August 1863, was his most notable achievement.Historically, Lawrence was the site of abolitionist and jayhawker groups' activities.During the border warfare that occurred from 1855 to 1861, as well as during the Civil War, irregular raids were carried out in Missouri by abolitionists, redlegs and jayhawkers, along with Union soldiers, resulting in robberies, theft, arson, and murder of citizens.The Union forces stationed at the border in August 1863 were irritated by the targeted attacks by Quantrill's guerrillas and the support of Confederate sympathizers in Western Missouri."]], [[134, 'which country was founded by muhammed ali jinnah?', 'A nation state is a combination of the political and cultural components of varying states, which seeks to establish its political legitimacy and sovereignty by accepting the declarative theory of statehood rather than the constitutive theory.The definition is functional, as it has been proven that attempts to establish terminological agreement around the country have not been successful.The characters of  nation \'\', a (sovereign ) state "" and another symbol of national pride are examined by Walker Connor in [ ].Connor, who coined the term ethnonationalism, also addresses the issue of confusing nation and state and the treatment of all states as if they were separate nations.Sheila L.\'s writing on globalization and belonging.

can be formed at different times across the globe.The idea of a nation state can be seen as contrasting to that of other state formations like multinational, city state, empire, and confederation.A polity within the nation state is where people are identified as the primary difference.The origins and early history of nation states are a subject of dispute.In theory, which came first: the nation or the country state?Scholars like Steven Weber, David Woodward, and Jeremy Black have put forward the idea that the nation state was not an accidental result of political ingenuity or unspecified sources.The 15th century\'s intellectual breakthroughs in political economy, capitalism, mercantilism, political geography, cartography, and map-making technologies have resulted in an unintended consequence.Intellectual discoveries and technological advancements led to the development of the nation state.Nationalist movements emerged to demand sovereignty, which was initially accompanied by the nation\'s existence.Nationalism, in the perspective of modernization theories, perceives it as a result of government policies aimed at unifying and modernizing an existing state.The nation state is commonly regarded as a 19th-century European phenomenon, supported by developments such as state-mandated education, mass literacy, and mass media.Nonetheless, historians observe the early appearance of a relatively unified state and identity in Portugal and the Dutch Republic.The French state is believed by Eric Hobsbawm to have existed before the formation of the French people in France.Hobsbawm maintains that the state created the French nation, not French nationalisme, which was established in the late 1800s during the Dreyfus Affair.According to Hobsbawm, the French population did not speak some French during the 1789 French Revolution, with only half of them being fluent in it.The Italian language was spoken by a smaller number of people during the Italian unification.The French government supported the amalgamation of diverse dialects and languages to establish the official language.The theory suggests that the implementation of conscription and regulations on public instruction in the Third Republic during the 1880s facilitated the development of a national identity.Political campaigns carried out by nationalists in the 19th century led to the emergence of certain nation states, including Germany or Italy.In both instances, the land was previously partitioned among other states, some of which were relatively small.The notion of shared identity was initially a cultural movement, as seen in the Völkisch movement in German-speaking nations, which quickly gained political significance.Nationalist sentiment and nationalist movement were evident before the unification of the German and Italian nation states in these cases.']], [[135, 'what nationality is james rodriguez who won the golden boot award at the 2014 fifa world cup finals

captured a fortress in Veracruz, which became known as the Pastry War or the First Franco-Mexican War.In March 1839, a peace was broken by the British after several months.The intervention was prompted by several reports of French nationals' losses caused by the turmoil in Mexico City and Mexico's failure to repay a significant debt to France.Mexico's two wars with France in the 19th century culminated in this incident, which was second to the French invasion of 1861-67 and resulted in Emperor Maximilian I being installed as the ruler of Mexico.The early days of the new Mexican republic were characterized by civil unrest as rival factions battled for power.Lorenzo de Zavala was removed from his position as governor of the State of Mexico by President Guadalupe Victoria in 1828.Zavala, with the assistance of Antonio López de Santa Anna, rallied most of the garrison in Mexico City (which was a part of Mexico State) to his rescue.After four days of fighting in Mexico City, Zavala emerged victorious and installed a new president, Vicente Guerrero.A significant amount of the personal belongings of residents were destroyed in street fighting.The common people had minimal options for recovering damages.They lacked any consuls or representatives to represent them.The government typically did not offer any compensation to foreigners whose property was destroyed or ruined by rioters or bandits.They began to appeal to their own governments for assistance and compensation, as they were often foreign merchants.Despite repeated claims by French citizens in the city, the French government allowed the issue to settle.In 1838, Remontel, a French pastry cook, claimed that his shop in the Tacubaya district of Mexico City was destroyed by looting Mexican officers from 1828.He made a plea to King Louis-Philippe of France.France demanded 600,000 pesos in damages for Mexico City, which was a significant amount for the country during that period.Especially crucial was the fact that Mexico's government had failed to repay loans from France worth millions of dollars.Diplomat Baron Antoine Louis Deffaudis gave Mexico an ultimatum to pay or face the satisfaction of the French.The French king, Anastasio Bustamante, refused to pay and sent a fleet under Rear Admiral Charles Baudin to block all Mexican ports from Yucatán to the Rio Grande, bombard San Juan de Ula, and take control of Veracruz, the most important port on the Gulf coast.By December 1838, the Mexican Navy at Veracruz was almost entirely seized by French troops.France was declared war on by Mexico.Due to trade restrictions, Mexicans began smuggling imports through Corpus Christi, Republic of Texas, and into Mexico.A group of Texan soldiers began patrolling Corpus Christi Bay to prevent Mexican smugglers, as they were concerned that France would block the ports in the Republic.Flour Bluff was named after a smuggling group who abandoned their approximately one hundred barrels of flour on the beach at the bay's mouth.The United States, mindful of its connection with Mexico, dispatched the schooner Woodbury to assist the French in their blockade.In the meantime, Antonio López de Santa Anna, a well-known military leader, left his hacienda near Xalapa and surveyed the defenses of Veracruz without any explicit government authority.He provided his services to the government, which commanded him to use any means necessary to combat the French.He was in charge of the Mexican army in their fight against the French.The French grapeshot caused injury to Santa Anna's leg during a skirmish with their rear guard.After his leg was amputated, he was buried with complete military honors.Santa Anna's use of eloquent propaganda to inflict wounds led to his return to power."]],

selecting the most deserving winner.Although hand-to-hand combat was a part of human history, the ancient Greeks may have first introduced boxing as an Olympic sport in BC 688.Boxing evolved from

mentioning.The period between 2000 and 1000 BC.Boxing was a well-liked spectator sport in Ancient Rome.Fighters wore leather thongs around their hands to shield themselves from their opponents.The use of tougher leather eventually emerged, and the thong was utilized as a weapon.The myrmex, a more menacing weapon, was created by the Romans who added metal studs to their thongs.Roman Amphitheatres were the venues for fighting activities.To please the crowd, boxing in its Roman form was frequently a death-match match.The acquisition of slaves and skilled fighters, particularly in later times, were valuable assets that could not be relinquished without due regard.Slaves were frequently utilized to use against each other in a circle on the floor.This is the origin of the term ring.The Roman gladiator era saw the end of boxing in AD 393 due to its excessive brutality.London did not experience the resurgence of boxing until the late 17th century.Classical boxing activity vanished after the fall of the Western Roman Empire due to the decline in interest in fistfighting and the reemergence of weaponry.Nonetheless, there are detailed accounts of different fist-fighting forms that were upheld in various Italian towns and provinces from the 12th to the 17th centuries.In ancient Rus, there existed a sport called Kulachniy Boy or  Fist Fighting.With the decline of sword usage, there was a renewed interest in fistfighting.During the early 16th century, bare-knuckle boxing (also called prizefighting) made a comeback in England.In 1681, the London Protestant Mercury published the first recorded bare-knuckle fight in England, and James Figg emerged as the initial champion in 1719.During this time, the term "boxing" was introduced.Take note that the first manifestation of modern boxing was markedly distinct.Contests in the Mr.In Figg\'s time, there were also activities such as fencing and cuddling, in addition to fistfighting.']], [[138, "the uk's longest national trail, what

around the South West Coast Path, which began in their native West Country in 1978, was intended to be the album\'s title.The band\'s sole instrumental album features songs that are named after and inspired by different locations along their musical journey.Show Of Hands and The South West Coast Path Team collaborated on the project to mark the path\'s 25th anniversary.Various organizations, such as The Countryside Agency, The National Trust, and English Heritage Commission, have given their approval to the album.The music is composed of ambient instrumental tracks that draw inspiration from various locations along the coastline.The pair aimed to inspire listeners to discover or rediscover the boundless fascination of the coast path through the album.The duo launched their album on 14 April 2003, exclusively through Hands on Music, a month before the release of Country Life.The South West Coast Path\'s new interactive official website introduced themed videos in July 2012 featuring music from The Path, a route that receives around 400,000 hits annually.The album Roots: The Best of Show of Hands (2007) included a track named " Port Isaac" from the album.Background Show of Hands made an impact in the 2000s by releasing an album of cover versions called Covers (2000), which featured a stripped-down sound without any overdubs or multitracking.They held their second concert at the Royal Albert Hall, which was recorded for their VHS concert film The Big Gig (2001). Their ninth studio album, Cold Frontier ( 2001), was co-produced by Mick Dolan and Steve Winwood.Both releases were met with critical acclaim, and the duo debuted The Cold Frontier Tour in November 2001, featuring many new or previously unreleased material.Cold Cuts (2002), the band\'s live album, was released in 2002 after incorporating material from the tour and received positive reviews.The pair started working on their next album.At the same time, The Countryside Agency was aiming to honor the 25th anniversary of the South West Coast Path, which is still the longest marked long-distance footpath in the UK.The route stretches for 630 miles from Minehead in Somerset to Poole Harbour in Dorset, passing through the coasts of Devon and Cornwall.The hike is one of the most arduous as it goes up and down with each river\'s mouth, and its total elevation has been estimated at 114,931 ft (35,031 m), which is almost four times the height of Mount Everest.The Ramblers Walk magazine readers have twice voted it as Britain\'s Best Walking Route, and it is regularly included in lists of the world\' best walks.After being established in 1973, the South West Coast Path Association oversaw the construction of the path for five years before it was officially opened in 1978.The association\'s silver jubilee in 1998 was celebrated by creating a fund to collect money for markers at Minehead and South Haven Point, and constructing Path Markers on the route between 2001 and 2002.Show of Hands, who had just started on their tenth album Country Life, were asked by The South West Coast Path Association to create an album that celebrates the path and its destinations in honor of its silver jubilee.Devon is the only English country with two coastlines, and the South West Coast Path passes through both of them.The pair\'s involvement led to it becoming a local project.The pair shifted their attention from Country Life to the album that showcased the Coast Path\'s silver jubilee.']], [[139, "the world's first publicly subscribed passenger railway, the stockton and darlington, opened in england with steam engines when?", "Between 1825 and 1863, the Stockton and Darlington Railway (S & DR) was in operation in north-east England.The world's first public railway that employed steam locomotives was officially opened on 27 September 1825, connecting collieries near Shildon with Stockton-on–Tees and Darlington.Rapidly expanding the coal supply to ships resulted in a profitable industry, which led to the extension of the line to Middlesbrough.Steam locomotives were initially used to haul coal waggons, but coaches were traditionally transported by horses until the introduction of steam locomotive carriages in 1833.The East Coast Main Line, which was built by the S & DR from York to Darlington, extended westward to Weardale and eastwards to Redcar, but it primarily expanded at Middlesbrough Docks.During the late 1840s, the company faced severe financial difficulties and was almost taken over by the York, Newcastle, and Berwick Railway, until iron ore discoveries in Cleveland and increased revenue allowed it to settle its debts.The railways that had traversed the Pennines to connect with the West Coast Main Line in Clifton, near, were taken over at the start of 1860.In 1863, the North Eastern Railway took over the company and transferred 200 rtmi of line and 160 locomotives, but it continued to operate as the Darlington Section until 1876.In 1875, 1925, and 1975, the S & DR's launch was considered an indication of the efficiency of steam railways, which was honored for its establishment.The Tees Valley Line, which is operated by Northern, now covers a significant portion of the original route.The removal of coal from the inland mines in County Durham was carried out using packhorses, followed by horse and carts as the roads were improved.George Dixon and John Rennie both proposed a canal in 1767 and 1815, respectively, but they were unsuccessful.A canal was proposed a few years later on 'a bypass route around Darlington and Yarm', and an opposition meeting took place in yarm.A tramroad was proposed by George Overton, a Welsh engineer, who was approached.During his survey, Overton created a route from Etherley and Witton Collieries to Shildon, passing through Darlington to StocktON.The railway was reportedly supported by Scottish engineer Robert Stevenson, and Quaker Edward Pease spoke in support of it at a Darlington public meeting on 13 November 1818, promising 5% return on investment.About 66% of the shares were sold within the local community, and the remaining ones were purchased by Quakers in the country.A private bill was presented to Parliament in March 1819, but it was rejected by 13 votes as it passed through the estate of Earl of Eldon and fox coverts.Overton mapped a new line that excluded Darlington's estate, leading to an agreement with Eldon. However, due to the death of King George III, approval of another application was delayed in 1820 during the parliamentary year and no bill was passed.The promoters submitted a bill on September 30, 1820, as the route had changed without an agreement with Viscount Barrington regarding the line that would cross his land.The railway was uncontested this time, but the bill almost slipped out of committee stage due to the lack of sales of the required four-fifths of shares.Pease paid £7,000 in a subscribed amount;He exerted significant control over the railway, earning it the nickname  the Quaker line.A railway was authorized for use by anyone with vehicles built to pay a toll, which could be closed at night and land owners within 5 miles could construct branches and junctions; the Act was granted royal assent on 19 April 1821.There was no reference to steam locomotives.This new railway prompted the construction of more railway tracks, leading to significant advancements in railway mapping and cartography, iron and steel production, and any other industries that require efficient transportation.Pease requested George Stephenson, a veteran enginewright of Killingworth's collieries, to meet Overton in Darlington because of his concerns about his abilities."]], [[140, 'which creatures are used as croquet balls in the novel ‘alice’s adventures in wonderland’?', 'A croquet is a sport that involves hitting plastic or wooden balls with sledgehammers through hoops, known as "wicket" in the United States.In November 1856, Isaac Spratt registered a set of rules with the Stationers\' Company in London, which contained information about the modern game of croquet, making it the oldest document to do so.The Public Record Office has taken possession of this record.The All England Croquet Club was established in Wimbledon, London, the same year that Moreton-in-Marsh held the first all-comers\' meet for croquet in 1868.Crocket, a form that has been commonly used since ancient times, was eventually introduced to England and the British colonies. It is similar to ground billiards in Western Europe, where it originated from classical antiquity and sometimes involved striking objects such as arches, pegs, balls, and mallets, much like field hockey sticks.In the 12th century, a team ball game called "or" was played in France and southern Britain, with players sharing games like football or hockey.Cornwall has attested it as early as 1283.The origins of croquet, which became a sensation in England during the 1860s and later spread internationally, are explained by Nicky Smith in her book Queen of Games: The History of Croquet.It is believed that the game\'s ancestor was brought to Britain from France during the reign of Charles II of England in 1630-1685 and was named "Pall-mall," a name that has been linked to the Latin word for "ball and mallet," which is also present in the French game.The ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica provided an explanation for this in 1877.In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, Joseph Strutt detailed the game of pall-maille in England as a ball hit with ice. The winner is determined by the player who strikes the ball with the least amount or most powerful iron mallet.It should be noted that there are two arches located at either end of the alley.The game of mall was a popular pastime during Charles the Second\'s reign, and the Mall Walk in Saint James\' Park was named after its purpose of entertaining visitors who played it frequently.Despite the presence of pall-mall names and games with similar names in other countries like France and Italy, the description above implies that croquet-style games were prevalent in England by the early 1600s.In some of the early modern sources, a pall-mall game played over an extensive range is mentioned, but Strutt\'s 1801 book portrays billiard-style ground gameplay with balls on the field, bats, and peg.The image\'s caption identifies croquet games as an unusual ancient pastime, emphasizing that they were not new in England during the early 1800s.Samuel Johnson\'s 1755 dictionary defines a game called pall-mall, which is similar to modern croquet in that involves hitting the ball through an iron ring.There is no proof that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke, which is the defining trait of modern sport.The second hypothesis suggests that the principles behind the modern croquet game were introduced in Ireland during the 1850s, possibly by being transported from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches.']], [[141, 'what language was first to be represented in dictionaries and related language theory?', 'Language is the capacity to acquire and employ intricate communication mechanisms, particularly those possessed by humans, and any specific example of this capability is considered a language.Linguistics is the scientific study of language.The philosophy of language has been a subject of debate since Ancient Greece, particularly between Gorgias and Plato, regarding the representation of experience in words.The origin of language has been argued by philosophers like Rousseau, while Kant and others have suggested that it can be traced back to rational and logical thought.Wittgenstein and other philosophers of the 20th century maintained that philosophy is essentially the examination of language.Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky are two of the most prominent figures in the field of linguistics.Estimates of the number of languages spoken globally vary between 5,000 and 7,000.Any accurate approximation is based on a partially random differentiation between languages and dialects.While spoken or signed languages are natural languages, any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli. Examples include whistling, braille, and a sign language.Human language is independent of modality, hence the reason for this.Language can be defined as the cognitive ability to learn and use complex communication systems, or it can refer to the rules that make up those systems or the utterances that can arise from them, depending on philosophical interpretations of language and meaning.Semiosis is the process by which all languages connect signs to specific meanings.Oral and sign languages have a phonological system that controls the combination of symbols to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and syntactic rules that combine words and glyphs to create phrases and expressions.The properties of productivity, recursivity, and displacement are inherent in human language, which is entirely dependent on social conventions and learning.Its intricate design provides a more extensive range of expressions than any recognized animal communication system.It is believed that language originated from the gradual modification of early hominins\' primate communication systems, which enabled them to establish a theory of other minds and share intentionality.The increase in brain size is sometimes associated with this development, and linguists believe that language structures have evolved to serve certain communicative and social functions.Various regions of the human brain are responsible for processing language, with particular attention paid to those of Broca and Wernicke.Language is learned through social engagement during early childhood, and it becomes acoustically clear to speak when children are around three years old.Human culture places great importance on language.Language has multiple social and cultural functions, ranging from representing group identity to grooming and entertainment.Through the comparison of modern languages, it is possible to reconstruct the history of language evolution and identify the traits that led to the development of new languages over time.The term language family is used to describe a group of languages that share common ancestry.The Indo-European family, which includes English, Russian, and Hindi, is the most commonly spoken language;Mandarin and other Chinese languages, as well as Tibetan, are part of the Sino-Tibetan family.The Afro-Asiatic group, which comprises Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew.Bantu languages, including Swahili and Zulu, as well as numerous other languages spoken across Africa, are prevalent.The Malayo-Polynesian languages include Indonesian, Malakkah, Tagalog, and many other languages spoken in the Pacific region.Tamil and Telugu are the dominant languages of the Dravidian language family in Southern India.Between 50 and 90% of the languages spoken in the early 21st century are expected to become extinct by 2100, according to academic expectations.Through Latin lingua, the English word language is derived from the Proto-Indo-European  tongue, speech, and language.The Old French language and the "language of the tongue".The term is occasionally used to describe codes, ciphers, and other types of communication systems, such as computer programming languages that are formally defined.']], [[142, 'in which us city is the 1974 film towering inferno set?', "An all-star cast, including Paul Newman and Steve McQueen, was featured in The Towering Inferno, a 1974 American action drama produced by Irwin Allen.John Guillermin was the director of the film.A joint venture of 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros.Stirling Silliphant adapted The Tower from Richard Martin Stern's novel The Glass Inferno and The Mirror by Thomas N.

can be found in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan as well.The etymology of the word Uzbek is still debated.According to one perspective, the name is derived from Oghuz Khagan, also known as Ogguzz Beg, who later became the term Uzbek.The name is said to signify self-sufficient or the lord itself, according to another source, derived from Oz and the Turkic words Bek/Bey/Beg.Another theory suggests that the way Uz is pronounced can be traced back to one of the Oghuz Turks, who were also known as Uxqab or Ugguz, but they combined the words Bey and Bek to create uguzz-bey, which means "leader of an OG.The Indo-Iranian people of Sogdia, who were the primary inhabitants of what is now Uzbekistan, were present before the 5th century when it came under its own name.It was a constituent of the Achaemenid Empire and later, the Sasanian Empire.Uzbekistan was a part of the Hephthalite Empire from the 5th to the 6th century.Uzbekistan was under the rule of Göktürk Khanate from the 6th to the 8th century.During the Chinese Tang Dynasty, Turkic and Chinese troops moved into much of central Asia, while military forces led by Turkish commanders were stationed in various regions.The An Lushan rebellion marked the end of Chinese influence.Transoxania was under the control of the Turkic Kara-Khanid Khanate from the 9th century, and their arrival signaled a clear shift from Iranian to Turkish supremacy in Central Asia.Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan, a Kara-Khanid ruler, was the first Turkic ruler to convert to Islam, and it was soon followed by most of Central Asia.Qara Khitai, a western Liao dynasty, conquered Transoxania in the 12th century and introduced the Chinese government system to Central Asia.The Kara-Khanid Khanate was destroyed by the Turkic Khwarazmian dynasty, a vassal of the Qara Khitai, in the 13th century.Despite the fact that the Turkic and Mongol armies had already invaded Central Asia by the 13th century, Iranian peoples like Sogdians, Bactrians or Saka-Massagetae tribes still made up the majority of Central Asian populations.The general consensus is that the ancient Indo-European speakers were assimilated by smaller but powerful Turkic-speaking groups, and the sedentary population eventually adopted the Persian language, which is considered the common language of eastern Islam.The shift from Middle Iranian to Turkic and New Persian was mainly due to an elite dominance process.During the Mongol conquest, the process experienced a significant boost as millions of people were either killed or forced to relocate southward to the Pamir region.The Chagatai language, which became prevalent in the Timurid Empire, is largely responsible for the development of the modern Uzbek language.With the fall of the Timurids and the emergence of Shaybanid Uzbek Khaqanate, the status of Chagatai and U.S. was strengthened, and this led to the development of modern Uzi language and culture that mirrored the ancient Iranian roots.The genetic makeup of the contemporary Uzbek population is diverse and influenced by the high volume of traffic entering Central Asia.In the past, Mongolia was home to Iranian tribes and other Indo-European peoples, but Central Asia experienced frequent invasions that had a significant impact on the region.A genetic genealogy study conducted by the University of Oxford has revealed that the Uzbeks\' clusters are located somewhere between the Iranian peoples and the Mongols.Beginning in the 3rd century B.C.The nomadic expansion of Central Asia was characterized by the presence of Altaic-speaking

Holst\'s writing features two frequent events on Mars and Uranus punctuated by organ.It is also featured in the book Bachianas Brasileiras No. by Heitor Villa-Lobos.The Prelude of Liszt\'s Fantasy and Fugue features the chorale "Ad nos, ad salutarem undam."Tchaikovsky\'s bassoon solo in his Pathétique Symphony and the 2nd movement of his Fifth Symphony are both examples of this progression, with the score ending with a crescendo to ffd in the Norman Dello Joio Suite for Piano.The finale of the Firebird Suite by Igor Stravinsky featured ffsf in its ending.Rachmaninoff\'s prelude, op., also contains ffdf.The score remains at 3-2.The fourth symphony of Shostakovich was as loud as the scale 5ff (\'s).During the third movement of Gustav Mahler\'s Seventh Symphony, a note is written on the celli and basses that shows ff (s) and instructs them to "pluck so hard that they strike the wood."Carl Nielsen takes the second movement of his Symphony No to a different level.The passage was marked as 5 ppppp for woodwinds\' diminuendo.Études No by György Ligeti exhibit a more extreme approach.Devil\'s Staircase 13 has a starting point of 8 with 6 f \'e.Ligeti\'s Études No.The number pppppapp is employed by him in the 9th part.Verdi incorporates pppp in the baritone passage Era la notte from his opera Otello.According to Steane (Ribbon 1971) and other experts, these markings serve as a powerful reminder to less inoffensive singers to sing with full force, rather than instructing them to attempt pppp.Such dynamic indications are not absolute.Music in a passage is marked as being slightly louder than p and slightly quieter then mf, with mp not providing an exact setting for volume.The interpretation of dynamic levels is primarily the responsibility of the performer;A diminuendo at the beginning of a phrase in the Barber Piano Nocturne leads to an mp marking.Another example of performer\'s control in this piece is when the left hand is shown crescendoing to a f, followed by the right hand playing the melody accompanied by p.It is believed that this is done merely to remind the performer to keep the melody louder than the harmonic line in the left hand.Certain music notation programs have a set of MIDI key velocity values that can be altered by the user, but more complex programs allow for customization.The ppp ( 16 ) in Apple\'s software, as well as the

"Machines and History."Given that tools are commonly used by both humans and wild chimpanzees, it is widely believed that the first routine use of tools occurred before the species\' divergence.It is likely that the early tools were made from perishable materials like sticks or unmodified stones, which cannot be differentiated from other stones used as tools.Stone relics were only discovered in the year 2500.It was 5 million years ago.A 2010 study found that the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis consumed meat by carving animal carcasses with stone tools.The discovery reduces the time period of the earliest recorded use of stone tools among hominins to roughly 3.4 million years ago.There have been discoveries of genuine tools since at least 2.Ethiopia has been in existence for 6 million years.The hand axe is one of the oldest types of stone tools that can be easily recognized.Prior to recently, weapons discovered in excavations were the only tools used for early human exploration and study.The recognition of cultural and historically significant tools has grown.In addition to hunting, other activities that required tools included preparing food, nuts, leatherworking, grain harvesting, and woodworking.The tools that helped ancient humans reach the top of the food chain were essential;The invention of tools enabled them to perform tasks that were previously impossible for humans, such as using a spear or bow and arrow to kill prey, since their teeth were not strong enough to penetrate the skin of many animals.The influence of "Man the hunter" on Hominin\'s transformation has been questioned.The identification of marks on bones at archaeological sites has indicated that pre-humans were more likely to scavenge for other predators\' carcasses than to kill their own food.Mechanical devices were utilized more extensively in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome as a result of the systematic use of new energy sources, particularly waterwheels.Windmills were added during the Dark Ages, leading to an increase in their usage.During the industrial revolution, machine tools led to an increase in the production of new tools.Advocates of nanotechnology foresee a comparable surge as tools become increasingly miniature.Tools can be classified based on their basic functions, such as cutting and edge tools, which are wedge-shaped tools that generate shear force along narrow faces.The blade of the tool should not be dulled by repeated use unless the edge is sharper than the material being cut.Periodic sharpening is necessary to remove deformation wear from the edge, even if tools are resilient.Other examples of cutting tools are gouges and drill bits.Using tools to move both large and small objects.A lot of levers offer mechanical advantages to the user.The hammer and maul are examples of tools that concentrate force, such as those used to hit nails or cut stakes.Physical compression is applied to a surface to make them work.The torque of the screwdriver is a rotational force.In contrast, an anvil concentrates force on a hit object by keeping it from moving away.By transferring compression-induced fluid to a

Geldof\'s lyrics and crafted the melody and backing track for the record.By calling out the most renowned British and Irish performers of the time, Geldof convinced them to be unrestricted in their appearances.To maximize the sales of his record, he selected musicians based on their notoriety.Despite his intention to appear on a BBC Radio 1 show with Richard Skinner, he went ahead of schedule and announced his Band Aid plan instead of promoting the new Boomtown Rats material.Band Aid was given a 24-hour notice by the recording studio on November 25, 1984, to record and mix the record.The pop video was recorded at SARM Studios in Notting Hill between 11am and 7pm, with the director Nigel Dick directing it, although some basic tracks had been recorded earlier at Midge Ure\'s home studio.The initial recordings were made of group and choir vocals that were filmed by the global media.After being rushed to the newsrooms, the footage was shown while the recording process continued.At a later point, Phil Collins recorded drums.A sample from a 1983 Tears for Fear\' track called " The Hurting" is used in the introduction of the song.Tony Hadley from Spandau Ballet was

Sweden to its northwest, Norway to his north, and Russia to her east.The Gulf of Finland is located to the south of Estonia.Finnland is a constituent of Fennoscandia, which encompasses Scandinavia.Finland's population is in the order of 5.The number of 5 million in 2014 has remained relatively unchanged from the previous 20 years.Most of the population resides in the southern area.Among European countries, it is the eighth largest in terms of area and the least densely populated country in the European Union.With a central government in Helsinki and local governments in 317 municipalities, Finland functions as parliamentary republic. It also has an independent region called the land Islands.A score that is greater than 1.The Greater Helsinki metropolitan area, with a population of 4 million, is responsible for one-third of the country's GDP.The integration of Finland into Sweden from the late 12th century is reflected in the widespread use of Swedish language and its official designation.According to Adolf Ivar Arwidsson's concept, the Finnish people have lost their Swedish identity and are essentially being Finns instead of Russians.In spite of this, Finland was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1809 and became the self-governing Grand Duchy of Finland.Finland was the first country in the world to grant full suffrage to all adult citizens in 1906, and the second in 1910.After the Russian Revolution of 1917, Finland declared its independence.In 1918, the fledgling state was divided by a civil war, with the  Reds, who lean towards Stalin and then affiliated with Germany, fighting against the Whites led by the German Empire.The country transformed into a republic after pursuing establishing it for brevity.The Soviet Union's repeated attempts to occupy Finland during World War II resulted in the loss of Karelia, Salla, Kuusamo, PetsamO, and some islands, while Finland continued to maintain its independence.In 1955, Finland became a member of the United Nations and implemented an official policy of neutrality.The 1948 Finno-Soviet Treaty provided the Soviet Union with some sway in Finnish domestic politics during the Cold War.Finland joined the OECD in 1969, the NATO Partnership for Peace in 1994, and the European Union in 1995.Until the 1950s, Finland was mostly an agricultural nation that did not experience significant industrialization.The development of an advanced economy quickly ensued, accompanied by the construction of a welfare state similar to the Nordic system, which led to widespread prosperity and one of the world's highest per capita incomes.Despite this, the GDP growth in Finland has been unfavorable since 2012, with a previous low of 8 % in 2009.Finland excels in several areas of its economy, including education, economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality of life, and human development.The World Human Capital and Press Freedom Index both ranked Finland as the top country in 2015, while its Failed States Index was considered the most stable, and it was positioned second in the Global Gender Gap Report.The majority of Finns are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, but their religious freedom is guaranteed by the Finnish Constitution.Etymology The name Finland is believed to have been first written on three rune-stones.In Uppland, Sweden, two objects were discovered with the inscription finlonti ( U 582).The Baltic Sea in Gotland was where the third discovery was found.Dating back to the 13th century, it features the inscription finlandi ( G 319).The name is thought to be connected to the tribe name Finns, which

slender bodies and short legs.The family Mustelidae, which includes badgers, otters, and wolverines, is commonly known as the "weasel family".The UK commonly uses the term "weasel" to describe the tiniest animal, Mustela nivalis.With a length that ranges from 173 to, female weasels are typically smaller than males and have red or brown upper coats with white bellies;The moulting of certain species in winter leads to a completely white coat among some populations.Their long, slender bodies allow them to pursue their prey into burrows.The length of their tails can vary from 34 to.Small mammal prey is a preferred diet for weasels, which have been occasionally labeled as vermin since they took poultry from farms or commercial warrens.Conversely, they consume a significant quantity of rodents.They are found worldwide, with the exception of Antarctica, Australia, and nearby islands.In the English language, the word "weasel" was initially used to describe a species within the same genus as an animal, specifically Mustela nivalis.The usage is upheld in British English, and the name is also utilized to refer to other small species within the genus.The term weasel\'\' can be used to refer to any member of the genus or the entire group in both technical and American contexts.Out of the 17 extant species in the Mustela genus, 10 have "weasel" included in their common names.Among the non-human animals are the stoat, polecats, ferret, and European mink.The Mustela vison and Mustella macrodon were once considered part of the American mink and extinct sea minkers\' genus, but they were later classified as Neovison in 1999.The Integrated Taxonomic Information System provides information on the species.The division of Europe and northern Asia does not include China.The polecat-ferret hybrid and the polekat-mink hybrid are part of the hybrid family in this genus.A range of cultural connotations has been attributed to Weasels.The presence of a weasel near villagers\' homes is considered ill-fated and even wicked in Greek culture, particularly when accompanied by an unmarried woman. This was due to the fact that it was believed to be an unhappy bride who was made to tear down wedding dresses.In Macedonia, weasels are commonly regarded as signs of good luck.Amulets from weasels were believed to possess strong magic in early modern Mecklenburg, Germany;The killing of weasels was specifically planned to take place between August 15 and September 8.Weasels were not intended to be slaughtered in the early medieval culture of the Wends, as well as in Montagne Noire and Ruthenia.Native Americans in North America considered the weasel as a negative representation;To cross it meant a rapid demise.Daniel Defoe believes that encountering a weasel is essentially devoid of any positive messages.In English, weasel can be a derogatory term, verb or noun, for someone who is perceived as sneaky, condescending, or unreliable.Weasel words are a critical term for words or phrasing that are unclear, misleading, or uncertain.Japanese folklore has been associated with ykai since ancient times, leading to various bizarre happenings.The Edo period encyclopedia Wakan Sansai Zue suggests that a group of weasels would cause conflagrations, and the sound of bumbling was believed to signal misfortune.In the Niigata Prefecture, the sound of a nate of weasels making rustle was similar to that of six people hulling rice, and it was believed to indicate either declining or flourishing homes.It is rumored that the sound ceases to exist when people pursue it.']], [[149, 'which british stage director won an oscar for his feature-film directing debut, which starred kevin

core.Parks like Parque Forestal and the Mapocho River, along with several isolated hills, shape Santiago\'s urban landscape.The Andes Mountains are visible from most parts of the city.The mountains\' smog is a significant problem, especially during the winter season.The city\'s periphery is teeming with vineyards, and Santiago is conveniently located within an hour of both the mountains and the Pacific Ocean.Santiago is the cultural, political, and financial hub of Chilean society, as well as the location of regional offices for various multinational corporations.The Chilean executive and judicial powers are based in Santiago, while Congress meetings are predominantly held in Valparaso.The name of Santiago is derived from the biblical character St.James.The nomenclature of various

the Santiago basin was where the first human groups of the X millennium were settled.The majority of the groups were nomadic hunter-gatherers who journeyed from the coast to the interior in search of guanacos during the Andean snowmelt.Around 800, the Mapocho River saw the emergence of agricultural communities that were primarily made up of maize, potatoes, beans, and camelids, leading to the settlement of the first sedentary inhabitants.During the late fifteenth century and early sixteenth centuries, the Inca Empire subjugated villages in areas inhabited by picunches groups or

jewelry, and pipes.Still-life painting, which has its roots in Middle Ages and Ancient Graeco-Roman art, became recognized as a distinct genre and professional specialization in Western painting by the late 16th century.Unlike paintings of landscapes or portraits, still life provides the artist with more freedom in arranging elements within a painting.Prior to 1700, early still-life artwork frequently displayed religious and allegorical imagery associated with the objects depicted.Using found objects, photography, computer graphics, video and sound, modern still life transcends the boundaries of two-dimensional mixed media.The use of larger compositions with details in painting gave rise to still life, which was frequently combined with figure-based subjects throughout history, particularly in Flemish Baroque art.The term pertains to the depiction of deceased animals, particularly game, in painting.Even though live animals are considered art, they were often painted from deceased bodies.The still-life category and zoological and botanical illustration have significant similarities, which have been shared by artists.Still life generally involves a fully realized environment and prioritizes aesthetic considerations over visual interpretation.Despite being at the bottom of the genre hierarchy, still life has been highly sought-after by buyers.Apart from the autonomous still-life subject matter, still life painting comprises other forms of art that incorporate significant stills, usually symbolic, and images that rely on various stillnesses to recreate a "piece of life."Inanimate objects are often depicted in trompe-l\'il paintings, which are a type of still life that attempts to make the scene appear realistic by deceiving the viewer.The interior of ancient Egyptian tombs is often decorated with still-life paintings that point to their development and antecedents.The belief was that food items and other depictions would be authenticated in the afterlife, making them accessible for the deceased to utilize.The depiction of everyday objects and animals in Ancient Greek vase paintings is a skillful craft.Peiraikos, a panel artist of low-lying subjects mentioned by Pliny the Elder, is also depicted in mosaic versions and provincial wall-paintings at Pompeii.In Pompeii, Herculaneum, and the Villa Boscoreale, a similar still life with figurative perspective has been discovered in Roman wall paintings and floor mosaics.In the homes of wealthy Romans, decorative mosaics known as " emblema" were used to showcase the variety of food enjoyed by the upper classes and also serve as signs of hospitality and celebrations of the seasons and daily life.Food and flowers were once again regarded as symbols of the seasons and the five senses by the 16th century.During the Roman period, skulls were utilized as symbols of death and physical remains in paintings, frequently with the phrase Omnia mors aequat (All that makes up to

They are also flexible and ductile, meaning they may be drawn out into thin wires.Out of the 118 elements in the periodic table, metals make up around 91 percent of all elements, while the rest are nonmetals or metalloids.Certain elements are present in both metallic and non-metallic configurations.The term  metal is used by asphysicists to describe all elements, except for hydrogen and helium.The metallicity of an object is determined by the proportion of its matter that contains chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium.The occurrence of metallicity in elements and compounds that are not typically classified as metals can be attributed to high pressures.The formation of these involves the creation of metallic allotropes made from non-metals.The arrangement of atoms in metallic substances is typically determined by three crystal structures, including body-centered cubic (bcc), face-center cubic(fcC) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp).The center of a cube made up of eight atoms is where each atomic point (bcc) is located.Each atom in fcc and hcp is surrounded by twelve more, but the stacking process differs.The structure of certain metals is influenced by temperature.Electrons in metals are frequently scattered and lose their outer shell, resulting in a cloud of electrons.The ability of metallic substances to transmit heat and electricity is made easier by this.The solid nature of the metal is created by the electrostatic interactions between each atom and the electron cloud, while the flow of electrons occurs.The bond is referred to as a metallic bond.The properties of chemical metals typically involve the formation of cations through electron loss, which can then form oxides when combined with oxygen in the atmosphere, such as iron that undergoes rusting over time or potassium that burns within seconds.To demonstrate, consider 4 Na and the addition of two cubes.Na2O ( sodium oxide) 2 O 2 N 2 CO2 reduced by 2 leads to CaO (calcium oxide) and Al raised by 4.Aluminium oxide is made up of 3 O2 and 2 Al2O3.The formation of a passivating layer of oxide that shields the interior results in slower oxidation of transition metals like iron, copper, zinc, and nickel.The atmosphere does not react with palladium, platinum, or gold.A layer of oxide that is too small to be broken by additional oxygen molecules on the surface of certain metals, such as aluminium, magnesium, certain steels and titanium, maintains their shine and good electrical conductivity for many years.Basic oxides are commonly found in metals, whereas nonmetals are typically acidic.Exceptions to this rule include highly acidic oxides like CrO3, MnO7, and OsO4, which have very high oxidation states.The prevention of corrosion is a common concern when metals are painted, anodized, or plated.To avoid the possibility of chipping, it is recommended to use a more reactive metal in the electrochemical series for coating.The electrochemical cell is formed by water and the two metals, and if the coating has a lower reactivity than the coat, it can actually encourage corrosion.Physical Metals are known for their high electrical, thermal, and density properties.They are usually pliable and flexible, with the ability to deform under stress without breaking.The optical properties of metals are characterized by their shiny and glossy appearance.Metal sheets that are thicker than a few micrometres may be transparent, but gold leaf has the ability to transmit green light.Nonmetals have lower densities than most metals, but the density of two different solid elements varies greatly, with lithium being the least dense and osmium having the highest density.The alkali and alkaline earth metals, belonging to groups I A and II A, are classified as light metal due to their low density, low hardness, and low melting points.']], [[156, 'what is a flemish giant?', "Oryctolagus cuniculus, also known as the Flemish Giant, is a domestic rabbit breed that is famous for its large size.In Flanders, the Flemish Giant was born.In the 16th century, it was bred in the vicinity of Ghent, Belgium.The breed is thought to have evolved from various meat and fur breeds, including the Stone Rabbit and European Patagonian.The Patagonian rabbit, a large breed that was once bred in Belgium and France, did not have any connection to the Sylvilagus brasiliens, an independent wild species weighing less than two pounds, or the Dolichotis patagonum, which is classified as cavy and cannot cross-breed with rabbits.The Flemish Giant Rabbit was first documented by Thomas Coatoam in his book Origins of the Fleming Giants, which dates back to 1860.In 1893, the breed's first standards were formulated.The Flemish Giant is the forefather of numerous rabbit breeds worldwide, including the Belgian Hare, which was brought to England in the mid-19th century.During the great rabbit boom of the early 1890s, the Flemish Giant was transported from England and Belgium to America to help increase the size of meat rabbits.It was not widely recognized until roughly 1910, when it started showing up at small livestock shows across the nation.The breed's varying color and unusual size make it a popular choice for rabbit shows, making it one of the most sought-after breeds today.The National Federation of Flemish Giant Rabbit Breeders, established in 1915, is responsible for promoting it.The Flemish Giant is known as a gentle Giants due to its calm disposition, while the more unusual rabbit can be used for various purposes such as pet, show, breeding, meat, and fur.The Flemish Giant, a large breed of domestic rabbit, has erect legs with hints of mandolin style. Its semi-arch design starts at the back end of the shoulders and extends to the base of its tail.The Flemish Giant Rabbit's body is characterized by its muscular build and relatively wide hindquarters.The Flemish Giant's fur is acknowledged to be both smooth and dense.The fur will return to its original position when stroked from the backward side to the head.Bucks possess a broad and substantial head in contrast to dot heads, and they can carry up to 1.It will take you 5 years to reach maturity.A large, full, and evenly distributed dewlap can be found on some dogs, which can take up to a year to fully develop.Flemish Giant Rabbits have an average weight of 15 pounds, while the largest ones can weigh up to 22 pounds. The longest one on record holds the world's record for being about 32 inches long.Seven different colors were identified by the American Rabbit Breed Association (ARBA) standard for this breed, including black, blue, fawn, sandy, light gray, steel gray and white.The average weight of a senior doe is 14 pounds, which is considered the show's standard.The show standard weight for a Senior buck is 13 lbs, which is equivalent to 5 kg.The weight of 9 kg.Flemish Giants exhibit a gentle and accommodating nature, adapting to their surroundings;This can only happen with regular contact with humans.Flemish Giants, like rabbits, can be intimidating and sometimes aggressive if handled incorrectly or in a reckless manner.The alignment of the spine when handling a Flemish Giant or any other rabbit is crucial due to their larger size.Potential owners should take into account their size, food consumption, and waste production levels when making a purchase.The Flemish Giant's size necessitates ample living spaces that allow for physical movement."]], [[157, 'which film, directed by david lean and starring john mills, opens with an escaped convict grabbing hold of a boy in a graveyard?', 'An English film director, producer, screenwriter, and editor, Sir David Lean, CBE (born 25 March 1908 to 16 April 1991) is best known for his work on big-screen epics such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, etc.Additionally, he is recognized for his contributions to the Dickens adaptations of Great Expectations (Sugar in 1946) and Oliver Twist (in 1948), as well as the romantic drama Brief Encounter (Columbia in 1945).Directors like Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick have praised Lean, who was ranked as the 9th best film director of all time in the British Film Institute\'s Sight & Sound  Directors\'Top Directors\' poll conducted in 2002.He has been nominated for the Best Director Academy Award seven times, with two wins for The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia, and three films in the top five of the British Film Institute\'s Top 100 British Movies.The AFI Life Achievement Award was bestowed upon him in 1990.In Croydon, Surrey, Lean was born to Francis William le Blount Leans and Helena Tangye, who were both early in their lives and educated there.He was a student at Leighton Park School in Reading, which was founded by Quakers who were his parents.During his time at Oxford University, Edward Tangye Lean, his younger brother, founded the first Inklings literary club.Lean was a dreamy, half-hearted student who was described as \'doing what any good student;\'"In his teens, he left and worked as an apprentice at his father\'s chartered accountancy company.At the age of ten, Lean received a Brownie box camera from his uncle, which was more relevant to his career than his formal education.Until the age of 16 or 17, it was common for boys to be given cameras.It was a huge compliment and I did well.The "great hobby" of Lean was to print and develop his films.Lean\'s father deserted the family when he was 16 years old after abusing his younger daughter, and subsequently pursued a similar path after having his first marriage and child.After working as a film editor, Lean was motivated by his work and spent every evening at the cinema. In 1927, he found realism in his job search at Gaumont Studios, where - thanks to his obvious passion for the project -- provided him with 1-2 weeks of free trial.He was appointed as a teaboy, advanced to the rank of clapperboy and eventually became an assistant director.In 1930, he began working as a newsreel editor, which included films from Gaumont Pictures and Movietone, and then moved on to feature films with Freedom of the Seas ( 1934) and Escape Me Never ( 1935).Pygmalion ( 1938 ) and Major Barbara ( 1941 ), two George Bernard Shaw plays produced by Gabriel Pascal, were edited by him.His edited works include Powell & Pressburger\'s 49th Parallel ( 1941) and One of Our Aircraft Is Missing ( 1942).After finishing his final film, Lean commenced his career as a director, having edited more than 24 features by 1942.In 1999, Tony Sloman stated that film direction can be best understood in the cutting rooms, as evidenced by the contributions of directors like David Lean, Robert Wise, Terence Fisher, and Dorothy Arzner.The Guild of British Film Editors conferred honorary membership upon David Lean in 1968.In his debut as a director, he collaborated with Nol Coward on In We Serve (both originally written by the same writer) and later made several of his plays into successful films.The films This Happy Breed ( 1944), Blithe Spirit ( 1945), and Brief Encounter (45 minutes) all feature Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard as understated secret lovers, caught between their erratic passion and their middle-class marriages in suburban England.At the 1946 Cannes film festival, it won the Grand Prix and earned Lean his first Academy nominations for directing and screen adaptation, along with a Best Actress nomination from Celia Johnson.']], [[158, "traitor's gate is part of

up of mainly electron-degeneratable matter.The mass of a white dwarf is similar to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable to Earth's.The emission of thermal energy from a white dwarf leads to its faint luminosity.Fusion is not possible in a white dwarf due to the lack of conversion of mass to energy.Sirius B, which is 8 in diameter, is the closest known white dwarf.The Sirius binary star's smaller element is comprised of 6 light years.Among the hundred star systems nearest to the Sun, it is believed that eight white dwarfs exist.The atypical latentness of white dwarfs was initially recognized in 1910.In 1922, Willem Luyten introduced the term white dwarf.Due to the near-trillion-year duration required, it is unlikely for a white dwarf to release all of its energy within the universe's existing state.The final stage of evolution for stars with mass that isn't large enough to be classified as neutron stars, such as the Earth's Sun and other stars in the Milky Way, is thought to exist as white dwarfs.1A red giant will undergo the triple-alpha process, which involves the fusion of helium, carbon, and oxygen in its core after the hydrogen-fusing phase of low or medium-mass stars.Insufficient mass at 1 billion K for a red giant to form core temperatures necessary for carbon fusion will result in the accumulation of an inert mass of carbon and oxygen at its center.When a star's outer layers are lost and reabsorbed to form planetary nebula, it will depart from its core into the remnant white dwarf.As a result, white dwarfs are typically made up of carbon and oxygen.Provided that the progenitor has a mass within the range of 8 to 10 is true.If the core temperature is high enough to fuse carbon but not neon, a white dwarf formation could occur due to the presence of an oxygen–neon–magnesium convexity.Stars with low mass are incapable of fusing helium, which can result in the formation of an extraterrestrial globular (H2O) white dwarf due to mass loss in binary systems.The absence of fusion reactions in white dwarf matter means that the star has no energy.Its high density is a result of its dependence on electron degeneracy pressure instead of the heat generated by fusion to support itself.A non-rotating white dwarf's maximum mass, known as the Chandrasekhar limit, can be approximately 1 due to degeneracy.Above the required electron degeneracy pressure, it cannot be supported.A type Ia supernova can occur as a carbon-oxygen white dwarf that is approaching its mass limit, usually due to mass transfer from ancillary stars, and may explode through carbon detonation.It is believed that SN 1006 is a well-known demonstration.The formation of a white dwarf is marked by high temperatures, but its energy will gradually dissipate and cool down due to the absence of an energy source.The radiation it emits, despite its high color temperature initially, will become less bright and reddish as time passes.The crystallization of a white dwarf will commence after its core solidifies as it cools over time.Due to its low temperature, the star will no longer emit significant heat or light, and it will transform into a cold black dwarf.The time required for a white dwarf to reach this point is estimated to be longer than the universe's current age of approximately 13.It is believed that black dwarfs have not been observed in 8 billion years.The earliest white dwarfs continue to emit at temperatures that reach several thousand kelvin.Among the first white dwarfs found, only 40 Eridani's triple star system was the case. The system consisted of one of the brightest main sequence stars in the universe, which is also called the closest binary system due to the presence of two other celestial bodies.William Herschel came across the pair of 40 Eridani B/C on January 31, 1783;The p.In 1825, Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve observed it once more, and in 1851, Otto Wilhelm von Strugave followed suit by 1850."]], [[160, 'in which country was the actor sid james born?', 'Solomon Joel Cohen, who is also known as Sid James;A South African-born actor and comedian, born on 8 May 1913 and residing in London until 26 April 1976.Starting in 1947, he was cast in several small and supporting roles in British films until the 1960s.He gained recognition by appearing alongside Tony Hancock in Half Hour, a television series that ran from 1956 to 1960. Later on, his acting career expanded as he was cast in the Carry On films, having played multiple roles in 19 of the series, with 17 of them being for Frankie Howerd in two other movies.His career in television sitcoms persisted for the rest of his life.The 1970s sitcom Bless This House, which he co-starred with Diana Coupland, was broadcasted from 1971 until James\' death in 1976.Despite being remembered for his lascivious nature, he gained fame in television by being described as the grand old man of dirty laughter on the Snopes website.Bruce Forsyth characterized him as being "a natural in his own skin."During his tour of The Mating Season at the Sunderland Empire Theatre on 26 April 1976, James passed away due to a heart attack.Les Dawson, a comedian, and others have asserted that they saw James\' ghost while he was at the theatre.In South Africa, James was born to Jewish parents and the name "Sidney Joel Cohen" from his birthplace on May 8, 1913.Hancock Street in Hillbrow, Johannesburg was the home of his family.He claimed to have had multiple jobs in the past, such as diamond cutter, dance teacher, and boxer, after settling in Britain later on.In actuality, he had undergone training and experience as a hairdresser.He encountered his first spouse at a hairdressing establishment in Kroonstad, situated in the Orange Free State.Berthe Sadie Delmont and his wife, Toots, got married on August 12, 1936, and they had a daughter named Elizabeth in 1937.The Johannesburg businessman\'s father-in-law, Joseph Delmont, purchased a hairdressing salon for James, but he later expressed his desire to pursue acting and joined the Johannesburg Repertory Players.The South African Broadcasting Corporation provided him with employment opportunities through this group.After serving in the South African Army as a lieutenant during the Second World War, he pursued acting as his profession.He moved to Britain with the help of his service gratuity right after the war.It is rumored that Sid was involved with the daughter of a prominent social figure in Johannesburg;He was advised to leave South Africa due to the potential controversy, which played a role in his decision.His first job was in repertory, but he eventually found himself in the emerging British post-war film industry.From 1947 to 1964, James made his first appearances as a credited actor in the crime dramas Night Beat and Black Memory.The barman of the alcoholic hero in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger\'s novel The Small Back Room ( 1949) was played by him.He made his debut as a comedian in The Lavender Hill Mob ( 1951 ), playing the role of Alfie Bass\'s bully robbery group, which was led by Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway.Lady Godiva Rides Again and The Galloping Major were also starring him in the same year.The role of Harry Hawkins in The Titfield Thunderbolt was played by him in 1953.Trapeze, a 1956 circus movie, was his most successful film of the year.

which is composed of alternating rows of keys that are played by the performer using both hands.The piano, which was invented in 1700, is commonly used in classical, jazz, traditional, and popular music for solo and ensemble performances, accompaniment, as well as for composing and rehearsal.Despite its limited mobility and high cost, the piano\'s versatility, chord-playing capabilities, and widespread use in performance venues and rehearsal rooms have made it a well-known musical instrument in the Western world.Typically, an acoustic piano is enclosed by  protective wooden casings and metal strings, with 88 black and white keys distributed over 12 different scales. The C Major scale has 52 white key keys, while the Black Keys have 36 shorter lengths to accommodate the "accidental" notes needed to play in all 12 modes.Pressing or striking the keys causes the strings to be sounded, and when they are released, a damper is used to silence them.The use of pedals at the base of the instrument enables the notes to be sustained, even when the keys are not in use.While the pipe organ and harpsichord were previously considered major keyboard instruments, the dynamics and tone of these instruments are altered by how much weight or force is applied by the performer to press or strike the keys.The piano\'s keyboard causes a padded hammer, often with strong felt padding, to hit the strings when one or more keys are pressed.The strings are released by the hammer, and they continue to vibrate at their resonant frequency.A bridge links the vibrations to a soundboard, which enhances their quality by better coupling coustic energy to the air.A damper is used to cancel the sound caused by the strings when the key is released.An acoustic piano with strings is commonly classified as percussion rather than stringed due to its being struck instead of plucked, unlike some harpsichord or spinet instruments.The Hornbostel-Sachs system categorizes instruments and classifies them as chordophones, including pianos.Technological progress has led to the creation of electric, electronic, and digital pianos.Jazz fusion and rock music in the 1960s and 1970s saw an increase in popularity of the electric piano.The term piano is a contraction of the Italian word for instrument, pianoforte, which is composed of gravicembalo col piano e forte and fortepiano.Italian musical terms for piano and forte refer to the variations in sound produced by a pianist touching the keys, with higher velocity and stronger force being used to produce different sounds.Earlier technological advancements in keyboard instruments served as the foundation for the piano\'s development.The Middle Ages in Europe saw the emergence of hammered dulcimers, which were the first string instruments with struck strings.During the Middle Ages, there were numerous efforts to produce keyboard instruments that utilized struck strings.The 17th century saw the well-developed mechanisms of keyboard instruments, including the clavichord and harpsichorald.The strings of a clavichord are struck by tangents, while those of the harpsichored are mechanically plucked by quills when the key is depressed.The harpsichord\'s mechanism had been studied for centuries, leading to the identification of optimal methods for creating a keyboard case, soundboard, bridge, and mechanical action.Bartolomeo Cristofori, who worked as the Keeper of the Instruments for Ferdinando de\'Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany and lived in Padua, Italy, is credited with inventing the modern piano.He had a skillful background in making harpsichords and was well-versed in the field of stringed keyboard instruments.']], [[163, 'the most noble order of the garter was established during the reign of which king?', 'The Most Noble Order of the Garter, established in 1348, is the third

Thursday of November after being fermented for a few weeks, is the most popular.The marketing of this "Beaujolais Nouveau Day" was arduous in the past, with efforts being made to distribute the first bottles to different markets worldwide.The current method of wine release is to ship the wine before Thursday, November 3rd and then distribute it at local markets at 12:01 a.m.m.The time that is in the local area.Until the Second World War, Beaujolais\' vin de l\'année was exclusively made for regional consumption as a way to celebrate the harvest\'s end.After the Beaujolais AOC was established in 1937, it was restricted to being sold officially after December 15th of the harvest year.The UIVB relaxed the rules on 13 November 1951, and 15 November was designated as the release date for Beaujolais nouveau, which had music playing as default.The UIVB recognized the potential for marketing Beaujolais nouveau.In addition to making a good profit, selling wine within weeks of the harvest was an excellent way to generate cash flow.The idea was born of a desire to travel to Paris with the first bottles of the new vintage.This garnered significant media attention and became a national event by the 1970s.In the 1980s, the races expanded to neighbouring countries in Europe, North America, and Asia during the 1990s.To maximize marketing opportunities during the upcoming weekend, the date was moved to the third Thursday of November in 1985.Known simply as Gamay noir à Jus blanc, the grape is used to make Beaujolais nouveau in production.The Beaujolais AOC is the only source of grapes, with no use for any of the ten  cru\'s appellations.They are cultivated in stony, schist-like soils.Both Beaujolais Nouveau and BeauJOLAIS-Villages Nouveau are being made;The latter is derived from the approximately 30 non-cru villages in the vicinity.The law mandates that all grapes in the region be harvested by hand.The wine is produced through carbonic maceration and anaerobic fermentation, which highlights the fruit flavors without removing bitter tannins from the grape skins.The grapes are placed in a sealed container that typically holds about 20,000 gallon of carbon dioxide.More CO2 is released during fermentation when grapes are crushed at the bottom of the container with care due to their weight.The absence of oxygen in unprocessed grapes leads to anaerobic fermentation, which is caused by the release of carbon dioxide.The wine produced is fresh, fruity, and has a low level of tannins.The celebration of this Beaujolais Day is accompanied by publicity events and extensive advertising.Even in English-speaking nations, the customary slogan was  Le Beaujolais nouveau est arrivé!The new Beaujolais has finally arrived!In 2005, the name was altered to  It\'s Beaujolais Nouveau Time!.The United States promotes it as a beverage for Thanksgiving, which is always one week after its release on the fourth Thursday of November.Neufeuilles, produced by various manufacturers, showcase a varied or colorful design that changes every year, often as an evolution of the previous year\'s design.Duboeuf produces silkties with an abstract design inspired by their label annually and distributes them through specific wholesalers and distributors.Bottled only 6-8 weeks after harvest, the Style Beaujolais nouveau is a wine that is aged to give it its youthful color and purple hues.The wine\'s tannin content is very low due to the production method, and it can be characterized by fruity ester flavors like banana, grape, strawberry, fig, or pear drop.The wine should be chilled to a minimum of 13°C ( 55°F).The intention behind Beaujolais nouveau is to serve it immediately.Although some nouveau can be preserved for a few years, there is no real

of Fountains Abbey, regarded as UNESCO World Heritage Site status.A dispute and riot broke out in 1132 at St Mary's Abbey, leading to the expulsion of 13 monks, including Saint Robert of Newminster, who were later taken into custody by Thurstan, the Archbishop of York.The River Skell, a tributary of the Ure, was given land by him in the valley.The secluded valley had all the natural attributes required to construct a monastery, including shelter from the elements, materials such as stone and timber, and water running in.The monks, who had to endure a brutal winter in 1133, applied for membership in the Cistercian order, which became the second house of the order in northern England in 135 after Rievaulx.The monks took themselves to Clairvaux Abbey, which was under the control of St Bernard in Burgundy.The group was instructed by Geoffrey of Ainai, a monk from Clairvaux, on how to observe the seven Canonical Hours and build wooden structures in accordance with Cistercian tradition.Following the election of Henry Murdac to the abbacy in 1143, the small stone church and timber claustral buildings were substituted.An aisled nave was added to the stone church within three years, and the first permanent claustral buildings built in stone with tile roofs were finished.The abbey was vandalized in 1146 by a furious mob who were dissatisfied with Murdac's involvement in his opposition to the election of William FitzHerbert as archbishop of York, burning down the church and some of the surrounding buildings.Following the attack, the community quickly regained its footing and established four daughter houses.In 1147, Henry Murdac resigned from the abbacy to become the Archbishop of York, and Thorald took over as his replacement after Maurice, then Abbot of Rievaulx, replaced him.After two years in power, Thorald was forced by Henry Murdac to resign.The abbey's stability and prosperity were restored by Richard, the next abbot, who held the position until his death in 1170.In his 20-year tenure as abbot, he oversaw a significant construction project that involved completing repairs to the damaged church and constructing more accommodations for the growing number of military personnel.His death did not include the chapter house, and his successor, Robert of Pipewell, carried on the work with a reputation for caring for those in need.William was appointed as the next abbot, serving as its head from 1180 to 1190. He was succeeded by Ralph Haget, who had started his studies in Fountains at the age of 30 as a novice soldier.During the European famine of 1194, Haget instructed the establishment of shelters and provided daily food rations to the impoverished, which helped improve the abbey's status and attracted more donations from wealthy patrons.During the first half of the 13th century, the reputation and prosperity of several Fountains were enhanced by the subsequent abbots.Despite being burdened with administrative duties and mounting expenses, they were able to accomplish another significant expansion of the abbey's structures.The plan involved the expansion of the church and the establishment of an infirmary.The abbey faced more challenging circumstances in the latter half of the 13th century.Eleven abbots were in charge of the monastery, which became financially unstable due to forward selling of wool produced by them. The abbey was also criticized for its poor material and physical condition when Archbishop John Romeyn visited it in 1294."]], [[166, 'what was the name of the operation whereby 1,373 u.s. citizens

place where golf is played is known as a golf course.The layout consists of several holes, each featuring a teeing ground, fairway, rough, and hazards, as well as identifying the location of sand traps.Golf\'s usual round consists of eighteen holes.The majority of courses have eighteen holes;Certain holes have shared fairways or greens, and a subset of nine holes is played twice per round.Par-3 courses are composed of nine or eighteen holes that each have a par of three strokes.Links, often along the coast, make up many of the older courses.Private, public, and municipal ownership are common features of courses, which also include a pro shop.Private courses are available at numerous country clubs.Golf course architecture is a distinct discipline, while landscape design or landscape architecture falls under the specialty category.Robert Trent Jones, Jr. is among the golf course architects who have become famous in their own right.It follows that;Professional golfers who are renowned have demonstrated an appreciation for the art of golf course design, including Jack Nicklaus.Despite the fact that many of the world\'s top golf course architects do not join associations like the American Society of Golf Course Architects, the European Institute of Glider & Structured Mechanics and the Society Of Australian Golf Appeals, it is important to note that these organizations are not government-approved licensing bodies but private entities.Golf courses typically maintain their original surroundings, but there is always a possibility of modification.The likelihood of new courses being built on less desirable terrain is increasing.While there may be natural hazards, bunkers and sand traps are typically artificial.The design of a fairway adheres to specific established guidelines, including the number of holes (often nine and eighteen), their par values, and the count of each par value per course.It is more advantageous to arrange the greens near the tee box of the next playable hole to minimize travel distance and to vary the combination of shorter and longer holes.The combination of a compact square or rectangular land area and the need to pack all the fairways together results in an oppositional pattern on the course.In intricate regions, two holes may be situated on the same tee box, fairway, or green.Typically, men, women, and amateurs are assigned to have their own tee-off locations, with each player lying closer to the green.Eighteen-hole courses are commonly divided into two groups: the  front 9 (9-1-9), the "back 9" (9-10-18).Especially older courses, such as the Old Course at St.Andrews\' layout involves the placement of holes in a loop, with the front nine being labeled as " out" and the back nine appearing in the same order on the scorecard.Inland courses are known for their design of the front and back 9s, which form a separate loop that starts and ends at the clubhouse.The convenience of playing a 9-hole round and having pauses at the clubhouse for snacks is advantageous for both the players and club.A successful design is both visually pleasing and playable.The strong designer is skilled in natural landscaping and understands the aesthetic significance of combining elements such as vegetation, water sources, paths, grasses, stone structures, and woodwork, among other things, with golf being a popular outdoor activity.Par-3, -4, and 5-hole golf courses are the norm for this type of course in most places, but some courses have par-6 holes.Only two courses, Ananti CC and the Satsuki golf course in Sano, Japan, have par 7 holes.The distances for the various holes on standard tees are typically listed below.']], [[168, 'the age of the railway began in which year with the introduction of

capital of Benin, Cotonou, the country's largest city and economic hub, is where the government functions.The estimated population of Benin in 2015 was around 10, despite the fact that it covers an area of 114,763 square kilometers.A total of 88 million.Agriculture is the primary source of income for Benin, a tropical and sub-Saharan country that relies heavily on subsistence farming.The official language of Benin is French.Even so, Fon and Yoruba, which are indigenous languages, are frequently spoken.Benin's most populous religion is Roman Catholicism, with Islam, Vodun, and Protestantisim being the second to-large group.The United Nations, African Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, South Atlantic Peace and Zone, La Francophonie, Community of Sahel-Saharan States, Africa Petroleum Producers Association, and Nigeria's Niger Basin Authority all count Benin among its member states.Between the 17th and 19th centuries, the Kingdom of Dahomey, Porto-Novo, and a large region with multiple tribes were the primary political entities in the area.The Slave Coast was the name given to this region since the 17th century, as a result of the massive amount of slaves being transported to the New World during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade.Following the abolition of slavery, France took control of the country and changed its name to French Dahomey.After gaining full independence from France in 1960, Dahomey experienced turmoil with multiple democratic governments, military regimes, and military coups.Between 1975 and 1990, the People's Republic of

in international relations.There is no correlation between Benin and its city in modern Nigeria, as well as the Benign bronzes.The new name of Benin was chosen to maintain its neutrality.The former Kingdom of Dahomey, which only covered most of the southern third of present-day country, was not designated as Dahomy. Consequently, it did not include Porto-Novo, Atakora, or Borgu.Prior to French colonialism, Benin was divided into three regions with distinct political and ethnic systems.Prior to 1700, there were several significant coastal city states, mostly of the Aja ethnic group but also including Yoruba and Gbe peoples, and a multitude of tribal areas inland, including Bariba, Mahi, Gedevi (the dominant tribe of Tewks), and Kabye people.Positioned mainly to the east of modern Benin, the Oyo Empire was the most significant large military power in the region, and it would frequently conduct raids and demand tribute from coastal kingdoms as well as tribal areas.The situation underwent a transformation in the 1600s and early 1700s when the Kingdom of Dahomey, which was of Fon ethnicity, was established on the Abomey plateau and began to control areas along the coast.The Kingdom of Dahomey's king, Agaja, conquered the coastal cities of Allada and Whydak by 1727, but it was not involved in any direct attacks on the Oyo allied city-state of Porto-Novo.The ascent of the Dahomey kingdom, the competition between the kingdom and Porto-Novo, and the ongoing tribal politics in the north persisted throughout the colonial and post-colonial eras.The Dahomey Kingdom was characterized by its distinctive culture and traditions."]], [[172, 'july 2, 1961 saw what nobel prize winning author take his own life in ketchum, idaho, who once stated that every boy must plant a tree, fight a bull, write a novel, and father a son in order to be a man?', "Located in central Idaho, Ketchum is a city that can be found in Blaine County.The population's figure decreased from 3,003 in 2000 to 2,689 in 2010, according to the 2010 census.The communities of Ketchum and Sun Valley have a common resource distribution; the area is located in the Wood River Valley.They are situated in the same valley as Bald Mountain, which is famous for its skiing.Tourists from all over the world flock to the city for activities like fishing, hiking, trail riding, tennis, shopping, and art galleries.Ketchum's airport, Friedman Memorial Airport, is located approximately 15 miles south of Hailey.Leadville, which was originally the smelting center of the Warm Springs mining district, was named as such in 1880.The postal department decided to rename it after David Ketchum, a local trapper and guide who had staked supine claims in the basin, as it appeared too frequent.Warm Springs Road's Philadelphia Smelter, which processed large quantities of lead and silver, was built in the 1880s.Following the mining boom's decline in the 1890s, southern sheepmen relocated their herds to the upper elevations of the Pioneer, Boulder, and Sawtooth mountains from Ketchum during the summer.The West's most significant sheep-shipping center was Ketchum by 1920.In the autumn, large herds of sheep migrated southward towards livestock quarters in the town's Union Pacific Railroad railhead, which linked up with the main line at Shoshone.Ketchum gained fame among celebrities, including Gary Cooper and Ernest Hemingway, after the Union Pacific Railroad developed Sun Valley in 1936.The area was a source of happiness for Hemingway;He engaged in fishing, hunting, and even acquired a residence overlooking the Wood River in Warm Springs during the late 1950s.He ended his own life in that place;He and his granddaughter, Margaux Hemingway, who is a model and actress, are interred in Ketchum Cemetery.A themed carnival with Old West wagon trains, narrow ore wagons and street gunfights, a parade, and Wagon Days festival are held in Ketchum every Labor Day weekend.The elevation of Ketchum, a city in the Geography, is 5853 ft.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city's total area is, with.

War, also known as the Second Anglo-Boer War or the "Second Freedom War," commenced on October 11, 1899 and concluded on May 31, 1902.The United Kingdom engaged in a battle against the Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State.The British war effort was bolstered by the participation of troops from various regions of the British Empire, such as Southern Africa, Australia, Canada, Newfoundland, British India, and New Zealand.The British emerged victorious in the war, leading to the annexation of both republics.The Union of South Africa absorbed both in 1910.While the First Boer War (from 1880 to 1881) is not as well-known, the Boers War is commonly known as such.The Afrikaans-speaking settlers in southern Africa were commonly known as "Ber" during that period.The South African War and the Anglo-Boer War are both referred to as such in South Africa.Tweede Boereoorlog, Twange Vryheidsoarlog (South Africa/Soil of peace), and the Anglo-Boerreoourlog are all Afrikaans names for this region.e.The two terms are "a war of liberation" and "an English oorlog".The South African War is the official name given to it in South Africa.The Boers and the British Empire engaged in a century-long battle, but the war\'s intricate origins were marked by the question of which country would have the upper hand over the Witwatersrand gold mines and reap the greatest benefits.During the Napoleonic Wars, British troops arrived in the Cape Colony and defeated the Dutch army at the Battle of Blaauwberg ( 1806).The British took over the colony in 1814 after the war, and they facilitated immigration from Dutch settlers who were highly hostile towards the Dutch.The Great Trek, which involved emigration away from the British Empire, was popular among Boers who were dissatisfied with certain aspects of British governance, particularly the abolishment of slavery on December 1, 1834.After pursuing the eastern coast towards Natal, the Trekkers moved northward towards the interior after Britain\'s acquisition of the region in 1843.In 1852, the South African Republic was founded and two Boer republics were created.The Transvaal Republic and the Orange Free State ( 1854) are also recognized as these locations.In 1852 and 1854, the British acknowledged both Boer republics, but their attempt to annex the Transvaal in 1877 resulted in the First Boar War in 1800-1881.In the aftermath of British defeats, particularly in the Battle of Majuba Hill (1881), the two republics were able to restore their independence on certain conditions.The relations remained uneasy.The discovery of diamonds at Kimberley by Erasmus Jacobs in 1866 led to a massive wave of foreigners moving to the Orange Free State.The discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand area of the South African Republic was made by an Australian in 1886.The Transvaal\'s gold wealth has made it the richest and potentially most powerful country in southern Africa;The country lacked the necessary manpower and industrial base to develop the resource independently.The Transvaal reluctantly accepted the arrival of a significant number of foreigners, mostly from Britain, who came to the Boer region in search of wealth and employment.The Transvaal may have had a higher number of uitlanders than Boers, leading to confrontations between the earlier-arrived Boer settlers and the newer non-Boer arrivals.The Jameson Raid of 1895 was a failure due to the influence of British expansionist ideas, particularly those championed by Cecil Rhodes, and disagreements over political and economic rights in the Netherlands.Dr.Leander Starr Jameson, the mastermind behind the raid, aimed to incite a rebellion of native Johannesburg inhabitants.Despite this, the uitlanders did not take up arms in support, and the Transvaal government forces surrounded the column and captured Jameson\'s men before they could reach Johannesburg.']], [[176, 'who swam the hellespont every night to meet

nominally independent ally of Rome and left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the Roman emperor in his will.Despite his death, his will was disregarded and the kingdom was annexed.The Romans borrowed money from Boudica and their daughters, who were subsequently subjected to flogging and rape.Boudica led the Iceni, the Trinovantes, and other rebels during the campaign of Roman governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus on Anglesey, situated on the northwest coast of Wales, in AD 60 or 61.They obliterated the present-day Colchester, which was once the capital of the Trinovantes but had been replaced by a settlement for exiled Romans and formerly housed ecclesiastical worshippers.Upon hearing about the uprising, Suetonius immediately headed to London, which was the rebels\' intended target.The Romans abandoned the settlement after deciding they were not in enough numbers to defend it.Among the 100,000 people who fought alongside Boudica were the Iceni, Trinovantes, and others, while also being burned and demolished in St Albans.Boudica\'s leadership was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 70,000–80,000 Romans and British in the three cities.In the meantime, Suetonius reorganized his troops in the West Midlands and, despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated the British in battle at Watling Street.Nero\'s decision to withdraw all Roman forces from Britain was influenced by the crisis, but Suetonius\' victory over Boudica confirmed Roman control of the province.Boudica either committed suicide to escape capture or fell ill.Tacitus and Cassius Dio, two

Bonduca from 1612.Boadicea, an ode by William Cowper in 1782, helped to popularize another version of the name.The name Boadicea was commonly used in the 19th and 20th centuries, but it is believed to have been mistranslated from a copy of Tacitus during the Middle Ages.The best-known manuscripts of Tacitus and the later, possibly secondary epitome of Cassius Dio both feature Boudicca as the spelling for her.The name is attested in inscriptions as Boudica in Lusitania, Boudiga in Bordeaux, and Bodicca in Algeria.Based on the later development of Welsh and Irish, Kenneth Jackson explains

In Latin, he is also called Amor ( Love).His Greek counterpart is Eros.Haydock\'s book The Book People, 1995, contains the Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia.215.Classical Greek art portrays Eros as a young man with feathers, but in the Hellenistic period, he was depicted as an overweight individual.The bow and arrow that symbolized Cupid\'s source of power were obtained through his iconography during this period, as the person affected by Cupions\' ailment was filled with uncontrollable craving.Cupid is a secondary character in myths, and his role is mostly to initiate the story.The Cupid and Psyche story depicts him as the main character who experiences the struggle of love after being wounded by his own weapons.Although he is not the subject of any other extended narratives, his tradition is filled with poetic themes and visual scenarios, such as Love triumphs over all and the revenge or torture of Cupid.The Amores, also known as amorini in art history, is a common representation of Cupid in multiples, which is similar to the Greek erotes.Cupids are a common feature in both Roman and Western art, which follow the classical tradition.Cupid\'s iconography becomes indistinguishable from that of the putto during the 15th century.Despite being under Christian influence during the Middle Ages, Cupid\'s dual nature as both Heavenly and Earthly love made him a well-liked figure.A renewed interest in classical philosophy during the Renaissance gave rise to complex allegorical meanings.Cupid is frequently depicted drawing his bow to encourage romantic love in modern culture, often as a symbol of Valentine\'s Day.The Romans reinterpreted Cupid\'s myths and concepts related to the Greek Eros in their own literature and art, while medieval and Renaissance scholars freely mixed the two.Eros in the Greek tradition had a dual heritage that was contradictory to one another.Asexually, he was one of the gods from birth.After his era, gods were created through the union of men and women.The only older characters in Hesiod\'s Theogony are Chaos and Gaia (the Earth).Prior to the gender binary dichotomy, Eros functioned by causing entities to separate their own belongings.The Eros, who was depicted as a thin young man, was seen as the offspring of heavenly parents, with the identity of each individual unique.The chapter on Cupid/Eros was authored by Natale Conti, a prominent Renaissance mythologist, who noted that the Greeks were uncertain about his parent lineage, which could be categorized as Heaven and Earth, Ares and Aphrodite, Night and Ether, or Strife and Zephyr.Pausanias, the Greek travel writer, disputes his beliefs by stating that Eros was the father of Aphrodite and the youngest of the gods.Without any reference to a father, Cupid is typically depicted as Venus\' son in Latin literature.Cupid\'s father is said to be Vulcan, the husband of Venus, according to Seneca.Despite this, Cicero asserts that there were three Cupid and Venuses in existence, with the first one being the son of Mercury and Diana, the second one representing Mars and the third one belonging to both groups.The last Cupid was the antithesis of Anteros, who are Erotes and embody certain aspects of love.The decorative representation of Cupids playing in art is a manifestation of these growing affections.Christopher Marlowe\'s writings on the

be ahead of its time in that it accurately portrayed the characteristics of submarines, which were primitive at the time.Unlike Journey to the Center of the Earth and other vernacular works, which are not scientifically sound and are more like adventure novels, the book has survived over time due to its scientific theories.The term refers to the depth of the sea, not the distance traveled, as 20,000 leagues is more than six times the Earth\'s diameter and nearly three times its circumference.The book\'s most extensive depth is four leagues.The book employs metric leagues, measuring four kilometers each.The French title would end in the plural form of " seas", which implies the passage of the novel\'s characters through the seven oceans.The title\'s early English translations employed

expedition at an unspecified time in New York.Ned Land, a Canadian whaler and master harpoonist, is joined by the loyal servant Conseil of Aronnax.The expedition departs from Brooklyn aboard the United States Navy frigate Abraham Lincoln and travels southward into the Pacific Ocean, circling Cape Horn.The ship tracks down the monster after a prolonged search and proceeds to attack it, causing damage to the ship\'s rudder.The three main characters are thrown into the water and grasp the hide of the creature, which turns out to be an ancient submarine.They are swiftly apprehended and taken into the vessel, where they encounter Captain Nemo, the mysterious creator and leader.The Nautilus, a secretly constructed submarine, is the vessel that the protagonists embark on in their journey and follow the story for the remainder of the book.Scientific curiosity and a desire for revenge, along with self-imposed exile from civilization, are both suggested by Captain Nemo\'s motivation.Nemo clarifies that his submarine is electrically powered and capable of conducting advanced marine biology research;He informs his new passengers that while he enjoys conversing with experts like Aronnax, preserving the secrecy of his life requires never releasing them.While Aronnax and Conseil are enchanted by the underwater journeys, Ned Land is left with no choice but to try his luck.They journey to various locations beneath the seas, with some being factual and others entirely imaginary.Consequently, the voyagers come across the authentic coral reefs of the Red Sea, naval devastation at Vigo Bay, Antarctic ice shelves, Transatlantic telegraph cable, and the imaginary underwater land of Atlantis.In addition to using diving suits to hunt sharks and other marine life with air-guns, the Nautilus also holds an underwater funeral for a crew member who died in an accident under mysterious circumstances.']], [[191, 'pre restraining order(s), who did people magazine name as their first

to press 'shift' and which number to produce the £ sign?", "A typewriter-style keyboard used in computing functions as a mechanical switch or electronic switch, typically held by an arrangement of buttons or keys.After the decline of punch cards and paper tape, computers' primary input device became teleprinter-style keyboards.The keyboard's keys are typically decorated with engraved or printed characters, and every key press corresponds to one written symbol.The creation of certain symbols involves pressing and holding multiple keys simultaneously or in a particular order.The majority of keyboard keys are capable of producing letters, numbers, or symbols, whereas other keys or key combinations can perform computer-generated actions or execute commands.The keyboard is still the most commonly used device for human-to-computer input of alphanumeric data, despite advancements in other input devices like the mouse, touchscreen, pen, character recognition, and voice recognition.The keyboard is commonly employed as a text entry mechanism to input text and numbers into programs like word processors, text editors, or other software.The software in a modern computer is typically responsible for translating keystrokes.Each physical key on a computer keyboard is distinguished from the others and communicated to the software responsible for controlling it.Computer gaming can be done with a standard keyboard or through the use of customized gaming features, which can make it easier to perform keystrokes quickly.A computer's operating system can be prompted with keyboard commands, such as the Control-Alt-Delete combination in Windows, which initiates task mode or shuts down machine.Command-line interfaces are entirely based on keyboard controls, or alternative devices that perform the same function.While typewriters are the ultimate foray into key-based text entry devices, the computer keyboard's use in electromechanical data entry and communication is largely due to the integration of teleprinters and keypunches.The layout of modern computer keyboards was inherited through the use of these devices.Teleprinter-like gadgets were utilized in the 1870s to exchange stock market text data between keyboards and telegraph lines, with the information being immediately copied and displayed on ticker tape.During the period of 1907 to 1910, Charles Krum and his son Howard developed the modern teleprinter, with Frank Pearne playing a key role in its early development.Royal Earl House and Frederick G. were among the individuals who independently created earlier models.Opinion.Herman Hollerith's initial keypunch inventions were soon followed by the development of keyboard devices that could enter text and numbers using keys, much like regular typewriters in the 1930s.The teleprinter's keyboard was instrumental in point-to-point and point to-multipoint communication for the majority of the 20th century, while the keypunch device'S keyboard played a similarly important role in data entry and storage.The earliest computers were equipped with electric typewriter keyboards, such as the ENIAC and BINAC.Typewriters were the primary means of data entry and output for computing from the 1940s to the late 1960s, when they were integrated into computer terminals.The limitations of computer terminals based on printed text, in contrast to the increasing data storage, processing, and transmission, led to a shift towards video-based ones starting with the Datapoint 3300 in 1967.Until the mouse was introduced as a consumer device in 1984, the keyboard was the most prominent and integrated computer peripheral throughout personal computing.Text-only user interfaces with limited graphics were replaced by visually appealing icons on the screen.Even though mobile personal computing devices like smartphones and tablets have adapted keyboards as an optional, touchscreen-based data entry method, they continue to play a significant role in

developing her photography skills while working at a kibbutz in Amir, Israel, for several weeks in 1969.Rolling Stone magazine hired Leibovitz as a staff photographer upon her return to the United States in 1970.Leibovitz was appointed as the chief photographer of Rolling Stone by publisher Jann Wenner in 1973, and she held this position for 10 years.From 1961 to 1983, Leibovitz was a contributor to the magazine\'s covers, and her private portraits of celebrities were instrumental in shaping the Rolling Stone aesthetic.While working for Rolling Stone, Leibovitz became more aware of other magazines and discovered that she could work in them and still produce her own personal music, which was the most important aspect of her profession.She aimed to connect with her subjects and gain access to their personal lives.In recognition of her ongoing and significant contributions to the art of photography, she was awarded The Royal Photographic Society\'s Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship ( HonFRPS) in 2009.During her time at the San Francisco Art Institute, she was inspired by photographers like Robert Frank and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Their personal reporting, captured in a graphic manner, was what we were taught to emulate.Richard Avedon\'s portraits have been cited by Leibovitz as a significant and impactful example in her life.Leibovitz, the photographer for the Rolling Stones, also documented their trips to San Francisco in 1971 and 1972, and acted as the concert-tour photographer during the Tour of the Americas \'75.Among her favorite photos from the tour was a photo of Mick Jagger in an elevator.In 1978, Leibovitz made history by being the first woman to capture Joan Armatrading in a photograph for an album.For a period of four days, she captured the images for Armatrading\'s fifth studio album To the Limit at her residence.Leibovitz was responsible for the photography on Armatrading\'s live album, Steppin\'Out.During their photo shoot for Rolling Stone on December 8th, 1980, Leibovitz and John Lennon made a deal that led to the latter\'s involvement.At first, Rolling Stone requested a photo of herself alone, but Lennon insisted that she put him and Yoko Ono on the cover as he was not interested.Leibovitz attempted to recreate the kissing scene from the pair\'s Double Fantasy album cover from 1980, which she adored.

This period saw Scotland and the Low Countries have significant trading and cultural connections, which are also evident in golf history.A curling stone and another with the date 1511 were found in Dunblane, Scotland, which dated back to the early 1500s.Kilsyth Curling Club was established in 1716 and is considered the world\'s first club;It remains in existence to this day.Kilsyth asserts that the curling pond at Colzium is the world\'s oldest purpose-built pool, constructed from a low dam and measuring around 100 to 250 meters in depth.The preface and verses of a poem by Henry Adamson in Perth, Scotland, both contain the initial mention of curling.The sport, which has been called the "roar of a game" in Scotland and Scottish-settled areas such as southern New Zealand, is named after the sound created by water falling on pebbles while rolling over them.The motion of the stone is referred to as curling, a word that originates from the Scots and English verb curl.In the early days of curling, river stones were nothing but flat-bottomed playing stones that varied in size, shape, and texture.The thrower\'s ability to control their curl or velocity was not as significant as it is today, and they relied more on chance than precision, skill, or strategy.The weavers in Darvel, East Ayrshire relaxed by playing curling matches with heavy stone weights from warp beams that had a detachable handle for relaxation.It was common for a wife to keep her husband\'s brass curling stone handle on the mantelpiece, brightly polished until needed.Until the early 1900s, central Canadian curlers frequently used \'irons\' instead of stones, with Canada being the only country where this practice was known to have occurred, while others experimented with wood or ice-filled tins.Scotland\'s climate during the 16th to 19th centuries made outdoor curling a popular activity due to its good ice conditions.The World Curling Federation, Perth is located in Scotland and was initially established as a committee of the Royal Caledonian Curlers Club, which is the world\'s most prominent curling club.The game has gained its most significant foothold in Canada, thanks to the presence of Scottish immigrants.']], [[197, 'for which scientific discovery did crick and watson receive the 1962 nobel prize for medicine?', 'The Nobel Foundation administers the annual Nobel Prize

in Physiology or Medicine in 1947 for her work on the metabolism of glucose, which played a significant role in various medical fields, including the treatment of diabetes.Certain awards have been the subject of controversy.António Egas Moniz was granted a prefrontal leucotomy in 1949, despite his objections to the medical establishment.The award\'s inclusion caused other controversies.The 1952 prize awarded to Selman Waksman was subjected to legal action, and his co-discoverer, Albert Schatz, received half of the patent rights that were not recognized under the prize.The 1962 award given to James D.Despite the recognition of their work on DNA structure and properties, Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins did not acknowledge the contributions of others, including Oswald Avery and Rosalind Franklin, who had passed away before the nomination.The Nobel Prize\'s longevity is a benefit, as the deceased cannot be nominated, and one prize can be awarded for up to 50 years after the discovery.The practice of awarding prizes to more than three individuals is not allowed, and the trend of scientists working together as a team has led to some controversial exceptions.Alfred Nobel was born into an engineering family in Stockholm, Sweden on 21 October 1833.A billionaire, he was a chemist, engineer and inventor who amassed his fortune through 355 inventions, with dynamite being the most famous.His interest in experimental physiology led him to establish his own labs in France and Italy to conduct experiments on blood transfusions.He was optimistic about the progress that would result from scientific discoveries made in laboratories and generously donated to Ivan Pavlov\'s laboratory in Russia.The French newspaper published Nobel\'s own obituary in 1888, titled "The merchant of death is dead," which caught him off guard.Despite the fact that Nobel\'s brother, Ludvig, had passed away, he was inspired to modify his will after being dissatisfied with the content of the obituary and fearing negative consequences for himself.In his last will, Nobel urged for his funds to be allocated towards creating a series of awards for individuals who bring the most significant impact on mankind in fields such as physics, chemistry, peace, medicine, and literature.Nobel had written several wills throughout his life, but the most recent one was composed just over a year before his death at age 63.The Storting ( Norwegian Parliament ) did not approve his will until 26 April 1897 due to the dispute.The Nobel Foundation was established to manage the bequest\'s assets following his demise.The Nobel Foundation\'s statutes were promulgated by Oscar II, the Swedish monarch, in 1900.The Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, a medical school and research center, is the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, as stated in the will.Today, the Nobel Prize in Medicine is commonly known as such.']], [[198, 'what won the oscar for best animated film in 2005?', "The creation of animated images is accomplished through the use of computer animation or CGI animation.The term computer-generated imagery encompasses both static and dynamic images, whereas computer animation only refers to moving images.While 3D computer graphics are a common choice for modern computer animation, 2D ones are still preferred due to their stylistic characteristics, reduced bandwidth, and faster real-time renderings.The computer and film are sometimes combined to create an animation.Traditional animation uses 3D models and 2D illustrations, but computer animation is essentially digital.Computer-generated animations are more manageable than physical processes, making them ideal for creating miniatures or crowd effects, and because they enable the creation of images that would be impossible with other forms of technology.Without the need for actors, expensive set pieces, or props, a single graphic artist can create content in this way.To create the impression of motion, an image is projected onto a computer monitor, and then replaced with another similar image that progresses at varying speeds, typically 24 or 30 frames per second.The technique is the same as the way television and motion pictures create an illusion of motion.The computer monitor is used to model objects and simulate 3D figures with a virtual skeleton for 3d animations.For 2D figure animations, separate objects and distinct transparent layers are utilized, with or without the virtual skeleton.Then there's the matter of limbs, eyes, mouth, and clothing.The animator moves the figure onto key frames.By using a process called tweening or morphing, the computer can automatically determine the differences in appearance between key frames.The animation is rendered at last.After modeling is finished, all frames must be rendered for 3D animations.The key frame illustration process is used to render 2D vector animations, while tweened frames are rendered as necessary.Pre-recorded presentations require the transfer of rendered frames to a different format or medium, such as digital video.Real-time rendering of frames is possible when presented to the end user.Animations that use low bandwidth internet connections.g.Often, Adobe Flash and X3D use software on the end-user's computer to render in real-time instead of streaming or pre-loading high bandwidth animations.The purpose of drawing pictures is to trick the brain and eye into thinking they are displaying a smooth object by reducing their speed to around 12 frames per second.A picture is a complete frame.The eye and the brain's processing of images do not result in any improvement in realism or smoothness when rates exceed 75-120 frames per second.The jerkiness that occurs when drawing new images at rates below 12 frames per second is easily noticeable to most people, as it diminishes the appearance of realistic movement.Hand-drawn cartoon animation typically uses a speed of 15 frames per second to reduce the number of drawings needed, but this is generally accepted because of the stylized nature of cartoons.Higher frame rates are necessary for computer animation to produce more lifelike imagery.The United States cinemas exhibit films that run at 24 frames per second, which creates the impression of a never-ending sequence.High resolution necessitates the use of adapters.Edward E. developed early digital computer animation at Bell Telephone Laboratories during the 1960s.The person in question is Frank W. Zajac.Kenneth C. Sinden, a.A. and Knowlton, respectively.Michael Noll is the individual in question.The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was utilized for practicing digital animation as well.The sequel to the 1973 movie Westworld, a science-fiction film about human society living and working among robots, was an early entry into the history of computer animation.In 1976, the sequel to Futureworld incorporated 3D wire-frame imagery, including a computer-animated hand and face created by Edwin Catmull and Fred Parke.The imagery was first exhibited in their student film, A Computer Animated Hand, which was completed in 1971."]], [[199, 'who invented the first practical camera in 1839?', "The origins of the camera extend beyond the advent of photography.The evolution of cameras began with the camera obscura and continued with many subsequent generations of photographic technology, including daguerreotypes, calo types, dry plates, film technologies, and digital cameras.The camera obscura, which is thought to have originated from the ancient Chinese and Greeks, evolved into Camera occurrence lenses that project an image of an external object upside-down onto a viewing surface.In 1021 AD, Ibn al-Haytham, an Arab physicist, released his Book of Optics.The first pinhole camera was created by him after observing the movement of light through a window shutter.The creation of sharper images was made possible by the observation of smaller holes, as noted by Ibn al-Haytham.The invention of the first camera obscura is attributed to Ibn al-Haytham.A solar eclipse was witnessed by Reiners Gemma Frisius of Leuven University on 24 January 1544 when he used a telescope, and his method was documented in De Radio Astronimica et Geometrico the next year.The method was first suggested by Giovanni Batista della Porta in 1558 as a means of aiding in drawing.Prior to the invention of photographic processes, there was no means of preserving the images captured by these cameras except through manual tracking.The initial cameras were limited to a room and could accommodate one or more individuals;Eventually, smaller models emerged, such as compact handheld cameras that were easily accessible for photography by Niépce.Johann Zahn's 1685 vision was the first for a small, portable camera that could be used for photography, but it took almost 150 years for this to become attainable.The first successful photograph of a camera image was taken by Nicéphore Niépce in about 1816 using his own small camera and silver chloride coated paper, which darkened the areas exposed to light.Niépce was unaware of any methods for removing the unprocessed silver chloride, which made the photograph non-permanent and darkened due to the necessary exposure to light.Niépce experimented with photography on Bitumen-coated surfaces using a sliding wooden box camera created by Parisian opticians Charles and Vincent Chevalier in the mid-1820s.The bitumen progressively hardened in the brightest parts of the image.The bitumen that had not been hardened was disposed of.One of those pictures has been preserved.Niépce died in 1833, but his partner Louis Daguerreo continued to experiment and eventually created the first practical photographic process by 1837, which he named the daguerreatype, and was later publicly released in 1939.Daguerre applied iodine vapor to a silver-plated copper sheet and applied it as SILID, which is considered light-sensitive.The image was created by exposing the camera to mercury vapor and then adding a strong solution of ordinary salt (salt chloride) to fix it.In 1840, Henry Fox Talbot developed the calotype, an alternative process.Both processes that were commercialized utilized basic cameras made up of two nested boxes.The rear section had a ground glass screen that could be taken off and back on to adjust the focus.The lens was capped and the sensitized plate or paper was enclosed in a light-tight holder that replaced the ground glass after focusing.The photographer uncapped the lens and opened the front cover of the holder, then counted off for as long as necessary to meet the lighting conditions before replacing the cap and closing the case.The mechanical simplicity of the device did not prevent the use of high-quality achromatic lenses.Despite the availability of Collodion dry plates since 1855, it was not until Richard Leach Maddox's 1871 invention of the gelatin dry plate that the wet plate process could be rivaled in terms of quality and speed.In 1878, the discovery that heat-ripening a gelatin emulsion greatly increased its sensitivity led to the adoption of instantaneous snapshot exposures.The need for a tripod or other support was relinquished for the first time.A fast plate or film could be used to capture an image with a small camera that can be held by the hand while taking the picture."]], [[200, 'name the palace and monastery , situated some 25 miles north of madrid, founded by king

for the Philippine Islands.The height of Spain\'s power and influence was during his reign.The Golden Age is a term used to describe this period.The phrase "the empire on which the sun never sets" was coined during Philip\'s reign to depict the magnitude of his realm.The years of Philip\'s rule saw state bankruptcies in 1557, 1560, 1515-84, 1575, and 1596.The declaration of independence that led to the establishment of the Dutch Republic in 1581 was partly influenced by this.The Spanish Armada, a massive naval campaign against Protestant England in 1588, orchestrated by Philip, an unrepentant Catholic, was unsuccessful due to logistical issues and storms.Despite his round-faced appearance, pale blue eyes, pink skin, and slight stature, Philip was described as attractive by the Venetian ambassador Paolo Fagolo in 1563.He is dressed very elegantly, and everything he does is courteous and kind," the Ambassador continued.Philip, born on 21 May 1527 in Valladolid to his wife Infanta Isabella of Portugal and his father, Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire, was born in the Spanish capital from 1528 to 1954.The courtly lifestyle and culture of Spain had a significant impact on his early life.He received instruction from Juan Martnez Siliceo, who would later become the Archbishop of Toledo.Both in terms of arms and letters, Philip demonstrated a reasonable level of skill.Later on, he received education from notable instructors, such as Juan Cristóbal Calvete de Estrella, who was a humanist.Despite his proficiency in Latin, Spanish, and Portuguese, Philip was unable to match Charles V\'s polyglot status.The House of Habsburg\'s German archduke, Philip, was considered a foreigner in the Holy Roman Empire.The sentiment was mutual.Philip sensed that he was Spanish in culture;Being born in Spain and raised in the Castilian court, he had a natural affinity for Spanish and chose to reside in this country.His ascension to the imperial throne would be prevented in the end.Philip was sworn in as the heir to the crown of the Cortes of Castile when he was eleven months old in April 1528. He spent the rest of his life at the royal court of castile, being raised by his mother and Dona Leonor de Mascarenhas until his death in 1539.Philip had close ties with his two sisters, Mara and Juana, and with the Portuguese nobleman Rui Gomes da Silva and his governor\'s son Luis de Requesens.Philip would rely on these men and Antonio Pérez throughout his entire life.Juan de Ziga, a Castilian nobleman and the commendador mayor of Castile, was responsible for Philip\'s martial training.During the Italian Wars, the Duke of Alba was in charge of supervising practical warfare skills.Despite his attendance at the Siege of Perpignan in 1542, Philip was not present as the Spanish army led by Alba emerged victorious over the French forces under the Dauphin of France.While returning to Castile, Philip was sworn in as the Aragonese Cortes\' defender at Monzón.']], [[201, 'the ‘la scala opera house’ is in which european city?', "A theatre building that includes a stage, orchestra pit, audience seating, and backstage decorations for costumes and sets is known as an opera house.While some venues are exclusively used for opera, other opera houses are included in larger performing arts centers.Opera has been a popular pastime in Italy, where the Teatro San Cassiano was founded in 1637 as the first public opera house.There are still a considerable number of opera houses in operation in the area.In contrast, there was no opera house in London when Henry Purcell was composing, and the first one in Germany was built in Hamburg in 1678.In towns and cities of the early United States, opera houses were responsible for hosting a range of events, including community dances, fairs with different types of attendees, plays, and vaudeville performances, as well as operas and other musical performances.The establishment of opera houses in the 17th and 18th centuries was frequently financed by wealthy individuals, rulers, and nobles who used arts patronage to advance their political ambitions and social positions.As social forms in Europe emerged in the 19th century, European culture shifted from being patronized to actively supported by the public.Opera and theatre companies have been able to raise funds in the 2000s through a mix of government and institutional grants, ticket sales, and private donations.A model for the Italian theater, the plant horseshoe at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples is the world's oldest known plant.This model was modeled after the theaters in Italy and Europe, including the Palace of Caserta, which will serve as inspiration for other venues.Opera houses are typically large, often exceeding 1,000 and sometimes several thousand seats, because of the popularity of opera in 18th and 19th century Europe.In the 19th century, Europe's major opera houses had a seating capacity of approximately 1,500 to 3,000, with locations such as La Monnaie in Brussels, La Montnaison in Odessa, the Grand Theatre in Warsaw, Opéra Garnier (with 2,200), and the Royal Opera House in London.The Metropolitan Opera in New York and the San Francisco Opera are among the larger modern opera houses of the twentieth century, with 3,800 and 3,146 respectively.A lot of operas are best presented in smaller venues, such as La Fenice in Venice with a capacity of about 1,000 seats.A traditional opera house has an auditorium that is shaped in a U shape, and the capacity of the audience depends on the length of its sides.Boxes, which are small partitioned sections of balconies, often lie closer to the stage and encircle it.Since the late 1800s, it has been customary for opera houses to have an orchestra pit, where numerous orchestra players are seated at a lower level than the audience, allowing them to perform without overwhelming the singing voices.The pit at Wagner's Bayreuth Festspielhaus is almost entirely covered, making it particularly noteworthy.The size of an opera orchestra can differ, but some performances may feature exceptionally large ensembles.It is possible to play over 100 players for Richard Strauss's operas or romantic period pieces.An opera may feature a diverse cast, chorus, dancers, and super-major figures.Hence, a prominent opera house will have ample space for an attendant.On-site set and costume building shops are commonly found in opera houses, along with facilities for storing costumes, make-up, masks, stage properties, and rehearsal spaces.Large stage elevators in major opera houses worldwide make it possible to quickly change heavy sets on highly mechanized stages.The Metropolitan Opera typically changes sets during performance, with the audience watching as the singers change positions."]], [[202, 'what number shirt did england rugby union player jonny

of the two codes used in rugby football.The most common game format involves two teams comprising of 15 players, more than rugby league, playing on an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with goalposts in the shape of H at the try line.Rugby School students were the first to draft football laws in 1845;The early development of rugby was marked by two significant events, namely the Blackheath Club's departure from the Football Association in 1863 and the division of professional rugby into rugby league and rugby union in 1903.The game was once considered an amateur sport, but in 1995, it became open to professional standards after restrictions were removed.World Rugby, which was initially known as the IRFB and IRB from 1998 to 2014 respectively, has been overseeing rugby union since 1886.The Home Nations of Great Britain and Ireland played a role in the expansion of rugby union, which was later embraced by many countries that were part of the British Empire.Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and France were among the first to take up the sport.Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga and Wales are among the countries that have made rugby union their de facto national sport.Over 100 countries across six continents participate in rugby union;The World Rugby team consists of 101 full members and 18 associate members.The Webb Ellis Cup is awarded to the champion of the Rugby World Cup, which was first held in 1987, and takes place every four years.The Rugby Championship in the Southern Hemisphere and the Six Nations Championship on the mainland

its inception, Super Rugby has included teams from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Additionally, Argentina and Japan have also had teams since 2016.The origins of rugby football are believed to be traced back to a game played at Rugby School in 1823, where William Webb Ellis is said to have run with the ball.Despite the doubts surrounding the evidence, the story was immortalized at the school through the unveiling of a plaque in 1895.The Rugby World Cup trophy is named after Webb Ellis, despite evidence that suggests otherwise.Rugby School alumni introduced the game to their university, giving rise to the origins of rugby football.The first football team was formed by Old Rugbeian Albert Pell, a student at Cambridge.During the initial stages, different schools utilized distinct regulations, and former students from Rugby and Eton endeavored to transfer their preferred guidelines to their colleges.In 1845, Rugby School produced the first written laws of rugby football, which were later incorporated into the 'Cambridge Rules' in 1848.The Football Association's departure in 1863 and the establishment of the Rugby Football Union in 1871, respectively, were significant events.The code was initially referred to as rugby football;The sport of rugby league was named rugby union to distinguish it from the league game, following the schism in England in 1895 that led to the creation of a separate code.Rugby is commonly known as rugby, despite the sport being named rugby union in its entirety. Rugby has gained popularity globally.The first rugby football international took place on 27 March 1871 between Scotland and England.Scotland emerged victorious with a 1-0 score.The year 1881 saw the establishment of representative teams from Ireland and Wales, and the first international tournament, the Home Nations Championship, was launched in 1883."]], [[203, 'on july 4,1817, construction

'canals' is used in the local dialect to describe both.A navigational system typically follows a river and shares its drainage basin, whereas clogged canals intersect dividing areas.In the event of water shortage, canals are utilized to transport water.An unimproved river has a series of channels called A navigation, which run parallel to its valley and stream bed.The river's drainage basin is always shared by navigation.The vessel navigates the still areas of the river and enhances, navigating through the same alteration in elevation.A true canal is a channel that crosses dividing drainage lines, creating directional connectivity between two separate drainage basins.In the first half of the 1800s, most commercially significant canals were a combination of both types, with rivers being used for extended distances and divide-crossing channels in other areas.Many canals that are still in use today meet this standard.To improve navigation, artificial waterways and canals use engineered structures such as weirs and dams to raise river levels to usable levels.Making looping cuts to create a gentler, longer channel around cliffs or falls;* Establishments to enable ships and barges to move up or down.Canals are more challenging to construct because they cross drainage divides and require additional improvements such as viaducts, aqueduct bridges over streams, roads, and ways to keep water in the channel.The transportation of goods and people is facilitated by canals, which are divided into two broad categories: waterways and navigations.These can be split into two categories: * Those that connect existing lakes, rivers, other canals or seas and oceans.Those that are linked by a city network, like the Canal Grande and other cities in Venice Italy;The Amsterdam gracht and the waterways of Bangkok.Aqueducts serve as water supply channels for the conveyance and distribution of potable water for consumption, municipal, hydro power, and irrigation purposes.The historic value of canals lies in their contribution to commerce and the advancement, flourishing, and vitality of a society.The numbers that were once the backbone of 17th-20th century industries and economies are now only surviving as modern canals.Today, the bulk cargo and large ship transportation sectors are the only uses for surviving canals, while inland boat and barge canal have been replaced by faster and cheaper railways first, followed by flexibility and slope climbing capabilities offered by lorries.Construction canals can be built using one of three methods, or a combination of the three depending on the availability of water and path.In areas where no streams are currently present, a canal can be created through the creation of artificial channels.The construction of dykes or levees involves using building materials such as dirt, stone, and concrete to create either the body of water or the sides of the canal.Water that is supplied to the canal must be sourced from an outside source, such as streams or reservoirs.Elevation engineering works such as locks, lifts, or elevators that raise and lower vessels must be changed in the new waterway.Canals, such as the Canal du Midi, Canal de Briare, and the Panama Canal, connect valleys that rise above a higher body of land.A canal can be created by dredging the bottom of an already existing lake.The lake is emptied and transformed into another canal when the channel is finished, providing for the drainage of the nearby polder and transportation.The list comprises of examples such as the.The construction of two parallel dikes in an already existing lake can create a new canal in the middle, which will then be channeled out into the rest of the lake.The construction of the North Sea Canal was carried out in this manner in the eastern and central areas.Pumping stations are necessary to keep the land surrounding a canal dry, either by pumping water from the canal into the surrounding waters or by

forest was once heavily forested, which is why it was named the "Forest of Arden."It appears that the area was not subject to forest law.The origin of the term was traced back to the Brythonic word ardu-  high, according to History.Previously, the highland of the Welsh ardd was covered with thick forests and became known as the Forest of Arden.The Forest of Arden, which was situated in the vicinity of England\'s geographical center and had no Roman road construction, was bounded by Icknield Street, Watling Street (present-day Glastonbury), Fosse Way, and a prehistoric salt track that ran from Droitwich.The region covered the majority of the ancient Warwick county, extending from Stratford-on-Avon to Tamworth in the north and including Birmingham and Coventry today, as well as remaining mostly rural areas with extensive woodland.The town of Henley-in-Arden, situated in a valley along the River Alne about 15 miles southeast of Birmingham, was the most crucial and largest settlement in the forest. It was an Iron Age hillfort.The southwestern corner of the forest is home to an ancient mark stone, which has been identified as Coughton Cross and is located at the junction with Icknield Street and the salt track.The National Trust is the proprietor of the structure situated at the southern end of Coughton Court\'s frontage.In accordance with the local tradition, travelers prayed at this place for a safe passage through the woods.The Forest of Arden was home to a preceptory owned by the Knights Templar, which was situated at Temple Balsall until the order was suppressed in 1312.The property was transferred to the Knights Hospitallers and they retained ownership of it until the 16th century\'s Reformation.The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was led by Robert Catesby, who hailed from Lapworth village in Arden.It is believed that numerous families in the area resisted the Reformation and maintained their Catholic affiliations, potentially including Shakespeare\'s family, who had paternal ancestors in Temple Balsall.Thorkell of Arden, a descendant of the ruling family of Mercia, was among the few English landowners who held onto vast estates after the Norman conquest, and his

1840.The change involved embracing machines over manual labor, exploring new chemical manufacturing and iron production methods, improving water power efficiency, increasing steam power usage, developing machine tools, and expanding factory infrastructure.In terms of employment, output, and capital invested, textiles were the most significant industry during the Industrial Revolution.The textile industry was the first to adopt modern production methods.The United Kingdom was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, and its technological advancements were predominantly made by British companies.The Industrial Revolution was a pivotal moment in history;Practically every aspect of daily existence was impacted in some manner.The average income and population both saw an increase that was unprecedented and sustained.The standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently during the Industrial Revolution, as some economists argue, but it was not until the end of the 19th and 20th centuries that this trend became meaningful.The Industrial Revolution occurred around the same time as an agricultural revolution in Britain, which helped to improve living standards.Mechanized textile production spread from Great Britain to continental Europe in the early 19th century, with France being a significant hub.Belgium emerged as a major hub for the production of iron.Industrialisation has spread globally since then.The exact beginning and conclusion of the Industrial Revolution, as well as the speed of economic and social change, are still disputed by historians.Capitalist economies experienced per-capita economic growth after the Industrial Revolution, while GDP per capita remained relatively stable before the industrial revolution and the development of the modern capitalist economy.According to economic historians, the Industrial Revolution is widely regarded as the most significant event in human history since the domestication of animals and plants.The Second Industrial Revolution occurred during the transition period from 1840 to 1870, coinciding with the evolution of the First Industrial revolution into the Second industrial revolution, which was characterized by the growing use of steam transport, machine tools, and machinery in factories powered by steam.The earliest known usage of the term "Industrial Revolution" is traced back to a letter dated 6 July 1799 written by French envoy Louis-Guillaume Otto, declaring France\'s involvement in the industrial revolution.In his 1976 book Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society, Raymond Williams notes that the concept of a new social order with major industrial changes was implicit from Blake\'s time in the early 1790s to Wordsworth\'S in late 19th century.Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui\'s 1837 description of the Industrial Revolution, also known as la révolution industrielle, demonstrated the increasing prevalence of this term for technological change by the late 1830s.Friedrich Engels\' book, The Condition of the Working Class in England, published in 1844, discussed the industrial revolution that had a profound impact on civil society.Engels\' book was written in the 1840s, but it was not until the late 1800s that his words were translated into English and entered common language.It is possible that Arnold Toynbee played a role in the term\'s popularity, as his 1881 lectures were informative and detailed on this topic.The term revolution has been criticized by historians like John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts, who argue that the economic changes were gradual and social.Historians are still in disagreement about this matter.The Industrial Revolution\'s inception was marked by a few technological advancements that began during the second half of the 18th century.Textiles and mechanised cotton spinning, powered by steam or water, were instrumental in achieving significant productivity increases for workers

fastest runner.The World Championships 100 metres have been contested since 1983.The men's 100 metres are won by Usain Bolt and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who are both Jamaicans and Olympic champions in their respective disciplines.An outdoor 400 metres running track typically starts the 100 m on the home straight, and an extension is added to create a straight-line race.The race commences in the starting blocks, with an official firing a pistol at the starter.Sprinters typically reach their maximum speed after 50-60 m.They slow down as they approach the finish line.Fast men have historically been able to gauge their performance against the 10-second barrier, while the best female sprinters complete the race in under eleven seconds.The current world record for men is 9.In 2009, Usain Bolt

361 yards, which was measured by 91 yards.The distance of 44 meters, which is now obsolete, was initially disputed in English-speaking nations.Few indoor facilities have a 100 m straight line, so the event is mostly held outdoors.No other country has won the men's Olympic 100 metres title, with US athletes having won 17 out of 27 races.At the beginning of a race, some athletes engage in psychological games, such as attempting to avoid starting until the end.During high level competitions, the gun and its blocks are fitted with sensors that electronically measure the time between the first kick and the initial kick.A duration of reaction time that is less than 0.The initial value of 1 s is considered to be unreliable.The 0.The duration between the startling sound of the starter's pistol and the runners' reaction is calculated by adding up to a 2-second interval.A sprinter was disqualified for several years if they were found guilty of two false starts individually.Nonetheless, this regulation enabled some significant competitions to be restarted so frequently that the sprinters began to lose concentration.February 2003 saw the introduction of the next rule, which allowed for a single false start on the field, but disqualified anyone who was responsible for another false starting.Some sprinters opted to false-start as a psychological strategy, which could result in their faster starters having to wait for the next start due to their slower reaction time.A further change was introduced by the IAAF in 2010, which would result in immediate disqualification of a false starting athlete to prevent abuse and enhance spectator enjoyment.The proposal was initially opposed in 2005 due to its refusal to allow for innocent errors.According to Justin Gatlin, a simple leg cramp could result in work lasting for an entire year.The 2011 World Championships saw a dramatic change in the rule, with Usain Bolt losing his world record.Mid-race runners typically reach their peak performance around the halfway mark, but their pace slows down as the race progresses.The 100 m training routine places great emphasis on maintaining the highest possible speed for an extended period.Pure athleticism and technique are crucial for success in the 100 m, with pacing and running tactics being less important.The IAAF Competition Rules dictate that the winner will be determined

painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, botany, writing, history, and cartography.He is considered one of the greatest painters in history and has been referred to as the father of paleontology, ichnology (philosophy), and architecture.The Renaissance humanist ideal was epitomized by him, who is occasionally credited with the invention of the parachute, helicopter, and tank.Many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the ultimate model of the  Universal Genius or Renaissance Man, a person who possesses an endless curiosity and feverish imagination.According to Helen Gardner, an art historian, the man's interests were unprecedented in recorded history, and his mind and personality resembled something otherworldly, while being mysterious and isolated.Marco Rosci notes that his life and personality were subject to much speculation, but his logical perspective on the world was not mysterious. The empirical methods he used were unorthodox for his time.Leonardo was born in Florence to Piero da Vinci, a notary, and Caterina, an ordinary woman. He received his education in the studio of Andrea del Verrocchio, one of the most famous Florentine artists.He spent a significant portion of his earlier career working for Ludovico il Moro in Milan.He later worked in Rome, Bologna, and Venice, while spending his final years in France at the residence bestowed upon him by Francis I of France.The main focus of Leonardo's reputation is as a painter.Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and parodied portrait, while The Last Supper is considered the least reproduced religious painting. Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam only brought them closer to fame.The Vitruvian Man sketch by Leonardo is regarded as a cultural symbol that can be found on various objects such as the euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts.Approximately fifteen of his paintings are still in existence.Leonardo is credited by most art historians with 15 significant works, either in part or in large.The quantity is primarily composed of panels, but it also comprises a mural, oversized drawing on paper, and two works that are in the initial stages of preparation.Numerous other artworks have also been attributed to Leonardo.Even so, these limited editions of works, in addition to his notebooks that contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his reflections on painting, make a significant impact on future generations of artists, comparable only to Michelangelo's.The technological prowess of Leonardo is highly regarded.His conceptualization included the concept of flying machines, an armoured fighting vehicle, concentrated solar power, and an adding machine, as well as the double hull, with a basic theory of plate tectonics.The infancy of modern scientific approaches to metallurgy and engineering during the Renaissance meant that only a few of his designs were built or feasible during his lifetime.His unacknowledged inventions, such as an automated bobbin winder and a device for testing wire tensile strength, were among the innovations he made that entered the manufacturing industry.Today, the Museum of Vinci exhibits working models of some of Leonardo's most practical inventions.He made significant progress in various areas such as anatomy, civil engineering, optics, and hydrodynamics but did not publish his findings, which had no direct impact on the development of subsequent science.Leonardo is currently acknowledged as one of the most diverse and skilled individuals to have ever existed.In the lower valley of the Arno river in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, Leonardo was born at the third hour of daylight on 15 April 1452 (old Style), during the Medici-ruled Republic of Florence.The birth of the child is documented in the diary of Ser Antonio, his grandfather on his father's side, as stated by Angela Ottino della Chiesa in Leonardo da Vinci, p."]], [[210, 'in which range of hills is the cheddar gorge?', "The Mendip Hills in Somerset, England are home to Cheddar Gorge, a limestone canyon that can be found near the village of Chessard.The Cheddar show caves, located in the gorge, were discovered in 1903 and are believed to contain the oldest fully preserved human skeleton known to date.

period of 2 million years.Permafrost obstructed the caves during the ice and frozen mud era, making the limestone impermeable.The gorge was created by water flowing on the surface after the melting of the material during the summers.The permeable limestone eroded and created caves in the gorge during warmer periods, leading to the absence of rivers in much of the region until the Cheddar Yeo river emerged underground from Gough's Cave.A 137 cm diameter pipe is used by Bristol Water to take in water from the Rotary Club Sensory Garden, a public park located in the gorge across from Jacob's

hard-shelled eggs, have a high metabolic rate, physiology (four-chambered heart), and skeletonity (weight but strong).Birds can be found all over the world and come in different sizes, from the tiny 5 cm bee hummingbird to the massive ostrich.The tetrapod class with the highest number of living species is comprised of around ten thousand, with more than half of them being passerines, also known as perching birds or songbirds.The fossil record reveals that birds are the final remaining dinosaur species, having evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group of saurischian dinosaurs.The Cretaceous period witnessed the emergence of true birds.DNA-based evidence indicates that birds underwent a significant diversification during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, which resulted in the demise of all other dinosaurs.Following their survival, birds from southern continents migrated to other parts of the world and diversified during periods of global cooling.Avialae, a wider group outside class Aves proper, has yielded bird-like dinosaurs dating back to the mid-Jurassic period.A significant proportion of the early  stem-birds, such as Archaeopteryx, were not yet able to fly with full power and many still retained primitive traits like toothy jaws and long bony tails.Depending on the species, birds have wings that are more or less developed;The extinct moas and elephant birds are the only known groups without wings.The ability to fly is inherited by most birds through the evolution of wings from forelimbs, but some flightless birds, such as ratites, penguins and diverse endemic island species, have emerged due to speciation.Birds possess specialized digestive and respiratory systems that are specifically designed for flight.Certain bird species that inhabit aquatic environments, such as flightless penguins and ducks, have developed swimming abilities.The contribution of birds, particularly Darwin's finches, was crucial to the development of Darwin and his theory on evolution by natural selection.Among the most intelligent animals are birds, particularly corvids and parrots;A significant number of bird species produce and utilize tools, while many social species transmit knowledge from one generation to the next, which is regarded as a type of culture.A multitude of species undertake extensive annual migrations over great distances.Birds are social creatures, communicating through visual signals, calls, and songs, as well as participating in cooperative breeding, hunting, flocking, or mobbing of predators.Most bird species are socially monogamous, typically for a single breeding season or occasionally for an entire lifetime.There exist polygynous breeding systems and rarely a polyandrous one with many males.Birds reproduce by laying eggs that are fertilized through sexual means.The parents typically lay them in a nest and then incubate them.After hatching, most birds require a prolonged period of parental care.Hens and other birds can lay eggs without fertilization, but unfertilized eggs do not result in offspring.Numerous bird species are of economic importance.Domesticated and undomesticated birds, including poultry and game, are essential sources of eggs, meat, and feathers.Songbirds, parrots and other species are popular as pets.The excrement of birds, guano, is collected and used as a fertilizer.Birds are a significant aspect of human culture.Human activity has caused the extinction of roughly 120-130 species since the 17th century, and many more were lost before that time.Human activity endangers approximately 1,200 bird species with extinction, but steps are being taken to preserve them.The ecotourism industry relies on recreational birdwatching as an essential component.The first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray in their 1676 volume Ornithologiae.In 1758, Carl Linnaeus revised his work and created the taxonomic classification system that is currently in use.The biological class Aves comprises birds according to Linnaean taxonomy.Theropoda, a dinosaur classification, is where Aves is located according to the tree's taxonomy.The clade Archosauria is composed of only two living groups, Definition Aves and the clone Crocodilia."]], [[212, 'who wrote the songs for the

War.Over 18,000 bunkers, tunnels, and tank traps were part of the line that covered more than 630 km.The network of defensive structures extended from Kleve, situated on the Netherlands border, to Weil am Rhein, located on Switzerland\'s border with the old German Empire.Constructed from 1938 to 1940, it was designed in 1936.The Westwall name, which was originally used for a defensive line

popular in 1939.On 20 May 1939, Hitler sent an Order of the Day to the soldiers and workers at the  Westwall.Every phase of construction included the construction of standard building elements, which included large Regelbau bunkers, smaller concrete pillboxes, and anti-tank obstacles like dragons\' teeth.The most efficient way to utilize scarce raw materials, transportation, and workers was through standardization.The shape of tank traps, also known as Höcker in German or humps or pimples in English, led to the nickname dragon\'s teeth.The reinforced concrete blocks are arranged in

Paulo has the second highest HDI and GDP per capita, as well as the fourth lowest infant mortality rate and the third lowest illiteracy rate among the federative units of Brazil.Its nominal GDP would be among the top 20 in the world if it were an independent nation, as per 2010 estimates.So Paulo is the most populous state in Brazil, the largest national subdivision in the Americas, and the third most densely populated political unit in South America, following the rest of the Brazilian Federation and Colombia, with over 45 million inhabitants in 2014.The nation\'s population is characterized by its diversity, with the majority being descended from Italian immigrants who arrived in the late 1800s.The Portuguese, who colonized Brazil and established the first European settlements there;Many diverse ethnic groups, including indigenous communities;African peoples, who were brought from Africa during the colonial period to serve as slaves;Migrants from other parts of the nation also migrated.The local population was largely composed of Arabs, Germans from Germany, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese immigrants.The state territory that now comprises the present area was already inhabited by indigenous peoples from around 12,000 BC.The coast of the region was first explored by Portuguese and Spanish sailors in the early 16th century.The Baixada Santista was where the first permanent settlement of Portuguese in the Americas, So Vicente, was established by Martim Afonso de Sousa in 1532.During the 17th century, the paulistas bandeirantes intensified their exploration of

certain parts of Europe.The male ducks are about 76 cm long and can weigh up to 7 kg, making them large creatures.The females are noticeably smaller and typically reach a weight of only 3 kg, which is roughly half the size of males.The majority of the bird is black and white, with males having iridescent and glossy back feathers, while females have more dullness.The white specks on the neck and head, as well as the bill, can be yellow, pink, black, or a combination of both.The presence of white patches or bars on their wings can intensify their visibility during air travel.The pink or red wattles on the bill are present in both males and females, with the male being larger and brighter in color.Despite its tropical nature, the Muscovy duck is capable of adapting to cooler weather and even survives in colder temperatures.The Barbary duck is the usual name for C.The culinary usage of moschata.The pato criollo ( creole duck) is the common name for this breed in Spanish, as it is closely related to the domestic plumage.Native Americans have been breeding these birds since pre-Columbian times, and they are heavier and less capable of flying long distances than the wild subspecies.The color of their plumage is more diverse.Pato casero and pato mudo are alternative names for the domestic breed in Spanish, which is also known as backyard duck and mute duck.The feet of Muscovy ducks are covered in long claws, and they have a wide, flat-shaped tail.The male domesticated drake has a length of roughly 86 cm and weighs approximately 3.5 kgs, while the female domesticating hen is significantly shorter at 64 cm in length and heavier.Domesticated males typically weigh around 8 kg, while females can reach up to 5 kg.All domesticated Muscovys have their

started it soon after finishing Emma and finished it in August 1816.The publication of Persuasion took place in December 1817, but it was written only in 1818.In 1817, the author passed away before anyone else.As the Napoleonic Wars conclude in 1814, the duties of Admirals and Captains of the Royal Navy are transferred to shore.After seven years, Anne Elliot meets Captain Frederick Wentworth due to the chance of her father's estate being rented by his sister and brother-in-law. She stays with her married sister in the vicinity for a few months.She ended her engagement despite falling in love with him for the first time.In addition to the persuasion theme, Austen references other topics that she was familiar with, such as the Royal Navy and its admiral brothers.The unrefined social milieu of Bath.The setting is extensively portrayed and serves as the backdrop for the latter part of Persuasion.In many ways, Persuasion is a departure from Austen's earlier works, both in terms of the more serious and angry satire directed at some of its characters than it was towards the otherwise good-willed protagonist Anne Elliot.The Royal Navy's energy and appeal are countercultural, but they also offer a chance for Anne and the reader to embrace sociability, engagement, and contentment, which ultimately prevails in the novel.Northanger Abbey is associated with persuasion not only because of the original binding of two books into one, but also because both stories are set in Bath, a fashionable city that Austen was familiar with during his stay from 1801 to 1805.Despite Austen's intention for the title to serve as an alternative theme for Persuasion, it was her brother Henry who gave it its name after her untimely death.The book incorporates the concept of persuasion, with vignettes serving as examples of how it can be expressed through visual aids.There is no known source that reveals what Austen intended to write in her novel.Whatever her intentions, she referred to it as The Elliots, in accordance with family tradition, and some critics argue that this was likely the intended name.It is likely that her brother Henry was the one who chose the title of Northanger Abbey when it was published.In contrast, Gillian Beer, a literary scholar, suggests that Austen had profound reservations about the levels and applications of persuasion in society, particularly in relation to the choices and pressures faced by young women.Austen and her readers were exposed to moral risks associated with persuasion, as stated by Beer.She notes that Austen was deeply troubled by her own advice to her cherished niece Fanny Knight regarding the possibility of accepting a specific suitor, even though it would have required extending the engagement.According to Beer, Fanny turned down her suitor and got married to someone else after her aunt's passing.Austen was acutely aware of the importance of persuasion in human communication, as stated by Beer.The plot focuses on several instances where individuals are trying to influence others or themselves, as depicted in the narrative.Beer emphasizes the novel's emphasis on power dynamics, seduction tactics, and new avenues for personal gain through persuasion.Anne Elliot, a 19-year-old who was thoughtful and warm-hearted, accepted bribes from Frederick Wentworth, an attractive young naval officer, seven years prior to the novel's opening."]], [[224, 'the babylonians invented the clepsydra. what was it?', 'Clepsydra, a water clock or device from the Greek word kleptein meaning "to steal";Any type of timekeeping device that measures the flow of liquid into or out of a vessel is called hydor.With the exception of the vertical gnomon and the day-counting tally stick, water clocks, sundials or hourglasses are probably the oldest time-measuring instruments.The exact time and place of their inception is uncertain, and their significant age may prevent them from being discovered.A water clock with a bowl-shaped outflow, known as the "bowl" type, was present in Babylon and Egypt during the 16th century BC.The earliest dates for water clocks in India and China are not entirely certain, but there is some evidence of them in other parts of the world.Water clocks were reportedly introduced to China in 4000 BC, according to some authors.The working mechanism of modern timepieces, also known as " water clocks", is dissimilar to that of their predecessors.They use a pendulum to control their timekeeping, but they also incorporate water for other purposes like powering the clock with an external water wheel or using water in display displays.Improved accuracy was achieved through the development of water clock design by the Greeks and Romans, who integrated an early feedback system, gearing, and escapement mechanism into their inflow clepsydra.Accurate water clocks with complex segmental and epicyclic gearing, water wheels, and programmability were developed in Byzantium, Syria, or Mesopotamia, eventually reaching Europe.The Chinese developed their own sophisticated water clocks, which included gears and escapement mechanisms, as well as water wheels, and shared their ideas with Korea and Japan.The development of certain water clock designs was done independently, and some knowledge was passed down through trade.A sundial was used to calibrate the early water clocks.Despite not being as precise as the modern timekeeping system, the water clock was the most accurate and widely used device for centuries, until it was replaced by more precise pendulum clocks in 17th-century Europe.A water clock, also called a clepsydra, is an instrument that uses alternating motions of water to measure time.The Torricelli\'s law is the physical principle that must be considered to understand clocks if viscosity is not taken into account.The water clocks are classified into two categories: inflow and outflow.An outflow water clock is designed to drain water from a container, which is filled with water and released slowly and evenly.The markings on this container are employed to indicate the passage of time.The water\'s level with the lines can be observed by an observer as it exits the container, indicating how much time has passed.The process of an inflowing water clock is essentially identical, except that instead of leaving the designated container, the water enters and fills it.As the container is filled, the observer can see where the water meets the lines and determine how long it has been in use.According to Callisthenes, the Persians utilized water clocks in 328 BCE to ensure equal distribution of water from qanats for agricultural irrigation.Zibad in Iran has been using water clocks since 500BCE.The Nowruz, Chelah, and Yald are examples of pre-Islamic religions that used them to determine their exact holy days and nights.Iran\'s water clocks were among the most useful ancient instruments for synchronizing the yearly calendar.The URL is subject to change without notice.The name given is aftabir.Accessible at

Schütz, Lully, and Purcell all played a role in establishing their respective national traditions in Europe during the 17th century.Italian opera was still prevalent in most of Europe during the 18th century, with the exception of France, which enticed foreign composers like Handel to study it.Until the 1760s, opera seria was the most esteemed type of Italian opera, but Gluck\'s "reform" operas challenged its artificiality.The late 18th-century opera\'s most popular figure in the 2000s was Mozart, who is best known for his Italian comic operas, such as The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Cos fan tutte, as well as a significant achievement in German literature, including The Magic Flute.Rossini, Donizetti, and Bellini marked the peak of the bel canto style in the first third of 19th century, producing works that are still performed today.

Range, which is part of the Great Dividing Range.The Hunter region is characterized by gentle, gently rolling terrain and slight slopes.The only notable deviation are the vineyards found on Mount View, which are located to the west of Cessnock.The Hunter River and its tributaries, including the Goulburn River, have created a flatter landscape for the Upper Hunter.The Hunter River is the main feature of the area, but it falls after the Brokenback Range.The Hunter's extensive river network, which encompasses Goulburn and significant tributaries like Giants Creek, is essential for irrigation in areas like the Upper Hunter, particularly during drought-prone times.The Liverpool Range of the Barrington Tops volcano acts as the starting point for the river, which then flows towards the south and eventually meets the Pacific Ocean in Newcastle.The Hunter Valley's wine industry has been highly successful due to its close proximity to Sydney, which was facilitated by the trade network that linked the valley to the city.The Hunter Valley's wine industry is largely driven by the continuous demand from Sydney consumers, which includes tourism as a significant contributor to the local economy.More than 30,000 years ago, the Wonnarua tribe of Aboriginal Australians resided in the Hunter Valley wine region.The Wonnarua, along with the Worimi tribe in the north and the Awabakal in south, created a trade pathway that connected the Coquun Valley to Sydney harbour.The history of wine-making in Hunter Valley can be traced back to the late 18th century, when the Europeans settled in Sydney and the New South Wales region of Australia as penal colonies under the British Empire.The Hunter River was accidentally uncovered by Lieutenant John Shortland in 1797 while searching for runaway prisoners.The area quickly became a valuable source of timber and coal, which were essential for the steamship industry to operate from Sydney.Following the discovery of grapevines in Sydney in 1788, they were planted, and as settlements spread towards the Hunter, government officials actively encouraged their growth as a means of promoting public safety and sobriety.The reason behind the promotion of wine production and its cultivation was that men tend to become more drunk and disorganized when intoxicated with highly alcoholic drinks.The belief was that providing enough wine could result in a moderate impact and temper the savagery.Under the influence of grapevine, land prospector John Howe traveled through the Australian wilderness from Sydney to the overland area in what is now the ( Lower ) Hunter Valley proper in 1820."]], [[230, "in 1337 which english king claimed the throne of france, precipitating the '100 years war'?", "During the period of 1340s to 19th century, the monarchs of England and Great Britain took over the French throne, except for two short periods in the 1360s and 1420s.The assertion was first made by Edward III, who claimed the French throne in 1340 as Charles IV's sororal nephew.Edward and his descendants battled the Hundred Years War and had some success in enforcing their claim during the 1420s under Henry V and Henry VI, but the Capetian cadet family's House of Valois was ultimately victorious and maintained control over France.Nonetheless, the English and British monarchs persisted in using the title of kings of France, and the French fleur-de-lys was included in the royal armies.The process persisted until 1801, when France became a republic and had no monarch.The claim was not explicitly denied by the Jacobite claimants.In 1340, Edward III of England took on the title, which was then held by the French Plantagenet dynasty.Edward III became the new king of France after his uncle Charles IV passed away.When Charles IV passed away in 1328, his mother Isabella of France introduced him as his closest male counterpart.Since the election of Hugh Capet in 987, the French crown had always been passed on based on male-line relations, which persisted until 1316.It had not been necessary or precedent for someone to succeed to the French throne on the basis of maternal lineage.For over three centuries, there were numerous sons in the House of Capet until the early 14th century, when new guidelines on female inheritance had to be established.The passing of Philip IV.'s son, Louis X, and the subsequent death of his son John I in 1316 left enough time to decide whether his daughter Joan or Philip would become queen.Philip orchestrated his coronation and assumed the role of Philip V of France.His supporters, including Princess Joan, Louis X's daughter, opposed him on the grounds of his right to the throne.He responded by assembling a group of prelates, barons, and burgesses in Paris, who recognized him as their legitimate ruler, but also stated that women were not eligible to become monarchs.According to reports, the idea was derived from the Salic law of the 5th century, but it was only discovered later and used by the lawyers of Valois kings to reinforce their masters' title with a more authentic feeling.Another dispute arose regarding the succession when Charles passed away in 1328.Despite the acceptance of women's inability to claim the French throne, Edward III, the nephew of the late king and closest male relative, maintained that a woman could grant her son inheritance.The claim was dismissed by French jurists, but it was backed by the principle Nemo plus juris ad alium transfere potest quam ipse habet, leading to the succession of the throne to Philip, his male line heir.At that time, Edward agreed to the outcome and honored Philip VI with his Duchy of Aquitaine.Edward, as the Duke of Aquitaine, declined to pay tribute to Philip in 1337.The French monarch responded by confiscating the remaining English-held territories in Aquitaine, specifically Gascony, which led to the Hundred Years' War and Edward's return to power as the King of France in 1340.The title of  King of France' was taken upon the request of his Flemish allies, who had signed a treaty declaring that they would no longer attack the French monarch."]], [[231, 'which duo are associated with the

This led to the subsequent Winter Olympics in 1994.The Winter Games have undergone changes since their inception.Alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, freestyle skiing (extreme cross-country skiing), skeleton, and snowboarding are just a few of the disciplines that have been added to the Olympic program.Certain Winter Olympic activities, including curling and bobsleigh, have either been discontinued or permanently abandoned, such as military patrol, although biathlon is a derivative of these events.Speed skiing, bandy, and skijoring were among the demonstration sports that were never

language) and English.The island has a population of about 3.A sum of 5 million.Puerto Rico's rich history, tropical climate, diverse natural landscapes, traditional cuisine, and tax incentives make it a sought-after destination for travelers worldwide.The island, which was originally inhabited by the Tano people, was claimed by Christopher Columbus for Spain in 1493, after being repeatedly invaded by different nations such as France, Spain, Portugal, and Britain.The island's ethnic, cultural, and physical diversity underwent significant changes during the four-century span of Spanish rule, with a significant number of Spaniard settlers coming from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, leading to the island becoming predominantly Catholic and Hispanic territory until the late 1800s.Following the Spanish-American War, the United States took control of the island in 1898 through the Treaty of Paris.By birth, Puerto Ricans are citizens of the United States.The Puerto Rico

series: carboniferous, permian, triassic, jurassic ?', 'A geological period and system known as the Triassic has been present for 50 million years.It has been 87 million years.The initial phase of the Mesozoic Era takes place during the Permian and Jurassic eras.Both the beginning and conclusion of the period witness significant extinction events.The Triassic, named by Friedrich von Alberti in 1834, is a collection of three distinct rock layers scattered throughout Germany and northwestern Europe. These layers are composed of red beds, marine limestone, and sandstones.A monograph on the colored sandstone, shell limestone, and mudstone that merge into one formation was published by Friedrich von Alberti in Stuttgart and Tübingen.G.Cotta (1834) was the author.The term  Trias\' was coined by Alberti on [ https : //books.Google.What is the purpose of com/books?"It\'s a good question to ask.The

limestone, and mudstone;E. is referring to their fossils.The thermometer of a geological period, de Beaumont;The current method of dividing these structures into three formations is not suitable, and it would be more appropriate to merge them into one formation, which I will call the " trias".Following the Permian-Triassic extinction event, which left the Earth\'s biosphere in a state of poverty, the Triassiic period began.Regaining its former diversity would be a challenge for life until the midpoint of the period.Therapsids and archosaurs were the primary land-based vertebrates during this era.Dinosaurs, a specialized subgroup of archaeologists, emerged during the Late Triassic period and did not become dominant until the following Jurassical era.During this time, the first true mammals, which were a specialized subgroup of Therapsids, and the initial flying vertebrates, known as pterosaurs, evolved alongside dinosaurs.The mid-Triassic era saw the continuation of Pangaea\'s extensive supercontinent, which then separated into two distinct landmasses, Laurasia and Gondwana.The Triassic period was characterized by hot and dry weather conditions, according to the news source.National geography is the source of information.The Triassic extinctions that occurred during the previous two decades caused by global warming in the scientific environment.Deserts cover a significant portion of the interior of Pangaea.The separation of Pangaea resulted in a change in climate and increased humidity.The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event was a significant event that occurred at the end of the period, leading to the era\'s conclusion and the elimination of numerous groups, which allowed dinosaurs to take over during the Jurassical period.Subdivisions of the Triassic era are typically divided into Early, Middle, and Late Epochs, with rocks being labeled as Lower (or Middle) or Upper Triasian.Paleogeography during the Triassic era saw the concentration of Earth\'s land masses into a single supercontinent called Pangaea, which was centered on the equator and represented the youngest to oldest faunal stages.A large gulf was introduced into Pangaea\'s Tethys sea from the east.During the mid-Triassic, the ocean that existed during the Paleozoic period began to shrink in the west, leading to the opening of new waters.All the sea was encircled by the world-ocean known as Panthalassa on those remaining shores.The Triassic oceanic plate subduction caused the disappearance of all deep-sea sediments laid down during this time.Little is known about the Triassic open ocean.During the Triassic period, Pangaea was experiencing rifting, but it had not yet separated.']], [[235, 'spider, idiot’s delight, canfield, pyramid and clock are all forms of what card game?', 'The game Spider is akin to the game of Patience.One of the most popular two-deck solitaire games is this one.The primary objective of the game is to remove cards from the table and place them in the tableau before removing them.The tableau is initially presented with 54 cards, arranged in ten piles, with the top 10 being face-down.The tableau piles are ranked and can be combined to create suitable sequences.If there are no empty piles, the remaining 50 cards can be dealt to the tableau ten simultaneously.The Gigantic Spider has four decks, while the Relaxed Spider requires less space and does not require rearranging.The Wisp, a solitaire card game created by Geoffrey Mott-Smith, is played in the same way as Spiderette and can be found below.Initially, twenty-one cards are distributed into seven columns of three, with the top card in each column being the only one shown face-up.Spider Solitaire, a software implementation with common software versions, is included with versions of Microsoft Windows Windows 7, Vista, ME, and XP.The Microsoft Plus now offers Spider Solitaire!An additional add-on was developed for Windows 98.The total number of cards in a deck is 8 cards, with 104 cards included.There are three versions of the game: Easy, Medium, and Hard.Windows 3 was previously released in an earlier version.In 1991, John A. contributed to x.Junod, the pioneer of WS_FTP.The final version of Windows Spider Solitaire was released in 92.It is 01.04.He authored a DOS version up to 93 called EGA-Spider.07.05.Arachnid, a comparable game, was also created for

regarding the date of the beginning of United States history.Older textbooks, which begin with Christopher Columbus' arrival on October 12, 1492, primarily emphasize the European background, while those from 1600-1700 center on the American frontier.In recent times, American schools and universities have tended to focus on the colonial period and the prehistory of Native Americans.The United States was home to indigenous people for thousands of years before European colonists arrived, primarily from England, after 1600.The Spanish had minor settlements in Florida and the Southwest, while the French lived along the Mississippi River and on the Gulf Coast.The Atlantic coast east of the Appalachian Mountains was home to thirteen British colonies by the 1770s, with a population of two and 500,000 people.The British government introduced a range of new taxes in the 1760s, but they rejected the American belief that any such taxes should be sanctioned by the public.The Boston Tea Party's tax resistance in 1774 resulted in the introduction of punitive laws, known as the Intolerable Acts, by Parliament to halt self-rule in Massachusetts.The American Patriots, who identified as such, adhered to a political philosophy called republicanism that stressed civic duty, virtue, opposition to corruption, luxury, and opulence.The thirteen colonies came together as a single Congress, which called for the creation of new state constitutions.Following the outbreak of armed conflict in Massachusetts, the Patriots expelled the royal officials from each colony and held numerous meetings and conventions.The colonies under the Patriot regimes were given the power to declare independence by their delegates to Congress in a unanimous manner.Congress declared the creation of a new independent nation, the United States of America, in 1776, rather than relying on countless isolated colonies.With the backing of France and General George Washington, the American Patriots successfully resisted British rule in the Revolutionary War.The 1783 peace treaty granted the new nation sovereignty over all land east of the Mississippi River, except for Spain and Florida, which held control over the territory until 1795.The central government established by the Articles of Confederation failed to provide stability as it lacked power to collect taxes or serve as an executive branch.In 1787, Congress organized a secret conference in Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation.A new Constitution was drafted and approved in 1789.The Bill of Rights, which was introduced in 1791, aimed to protect inalienable rights.A strong central government was established when Alexander Hamilton became the chief political and financial adviser of Union President George Washington.The Louisiana Territory, which was purchased by Thomas Jefferson from France during his presidency, doubled the size of the United States.The year 1812 marked the beginning of a second and final war with Britain.The idea of Manifest Destiny spurred the expansion of federal territory to the Pacific.The U.S.S.The region's landmass was large, but its population was small, with only 4 million people in 1790.The population grew rapidly, reaching 7 in number.The years 1810 to 1860 saw the number of people living on the same scale, which was 2 million in 1940 and 321 million for the following year.The overall GDP growth rate accelerated even further.Prior to 1940, the country's military might was relatively weak during peacetime.The expansion was fueled by the desire for inexpensive land for both yeoman farmers and slave owners.Political and constitutional battles were triggered by the increasing controversy surrounding the expansion of slavery, but they were eventually resolved through compromises.All states situated below the Mason-Dixon line had ceased slavery by 1804, but the South was able to reap the benefits of the institution, thanks to the rise in high-value cotton exports that were highly sought after in Europe.Republican Abraham Lincoln's campaign in the 1860 presidential election was focused on ending slavery and putting it on the verge of extinction.The Confederacy was founded by the seven cotton-based slave states in the deep South, who seceded shortly before Lincoln's inauguration.The Confederacy never officially recognized the alliance, but its attack on Fort Sumter in 1861 was a significant start to the war."]], [[237, 'the italian soccer club sampdoria plays home games in which city?', "A unitary parliamentary republic, the Italian Republic is the

Stivale in Italy because of its shape.With a population of 61 million, it is the third most populous EU country.Positioned in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy has open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino, and Vatican City.The Phoenicians and Etruscans, along with the Celts and Celtians since classical times, have inhabited the southern, central, and northern regions of the Italian Peninsula, while the Italic peoples are dispersed throughout Italy, alongside other ancient Italian tribes.After the Latins founded the Roman Kingdom, it spread throughout Italy, assimilating and conquering other nearby civilizations to form the Republic.The ancient world was conquered by Rome, which ultimately became the dominant force in culture, politics, and religion.The Roman Empire's legacy is evident in the worldwide distribution of civilian law, republican governments, Christianity, and the Latin script.Italy experienced a sociopolitical collapse during the Middle Ages due to barbarian invasions, but by the 11th century, shipping, commerce, and banking helped create numerous rival city-states and maritime republics that thrived and served as models for capitalism.The independent city-states and regional republics, which were Europe's primary gateway for Asian and Near Eastern imported goods, often had a higher degree of democracy than the monarchies and feudal states found throughout Europe during that period. However, most of central Italy was still under the control of the theocratic Papal States, while Southern Italy remained mostly feudicative due to annexation by Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Spanish, and Bourbon.The Renaissance began in Italy and spread throughout Europe, bringing with it a renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration, and art.The period witnessed the flourishing of Italian culture, which led to the emergence of notable scholars, artists, and polymaths like Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Michelangelo und Machiavelli.The European Age of Discovery was initiated by the discovery of new routes to the Far East and the New World by Italian explorers like Marco Polo, Christopher Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and Giovanni da Verrazzano.However, Italy's significance as a commercial and political center diminished significantly with the advent of trade routes from the New World, as European imports and trade paths became more influential and Italian city-states had lost control of the East Asian and Mediterranean trade route.Moreover, the Italian city-states were frequently involved in violent conflicts that resulted in intense tension and bitter rivalry, culminating in the 15th and 16th century Italian Wars, which exposed their vulnerability to European allies through foreign invasions.After years of political fragmentation and falling into conquest, occupation, and foreign domination by European powers like France, Spain, or Austria, Italy entered a period of decline.During the mid-1800s, Italian nationalism and independence from foreign control led to a period of revolutionary political upheaval known as the Risorgimento. The movement sought to revive Italian culture and economy by freeing and unifying Italy, resulting in the formation of an independent nation-state.Despite several failed attempts, the Italian Wars of Independence and the Expedition of the Thousand resulted in Italy becoming a great power after centuries of foreign rule and political division."]], [[238, 'jenny shipley was the first female prime minister of which country?', "Dame Jennifer Mary Shipley, born in 1952, was the 36th Prime Minister of New Zealand from December 1997 to December 1999.

He was the second of eight children born to John Dickens and Elizabeth Dickened (born 1785-1851); he had a sister named Elizabeth; they were both active in rural areas around London.Between 1789 and 1863,While serving in the district, his father worked as a Navy Pay Office clerk.He requested Christopher Huffam, the rigger for His Majesty\'s Navy and the head of an established company, to act as a godfather to Charles.It is believed that Huffam served as the inspiration for Paul Dombey, who ran a shipping firm in Dickens\' Domes and Son (1848).John Dickens was recalled to London in January 1815, prompting the family to relocate to Norfolk Street in Fitzrovia.They moved to Sheerness and Chatham, Kent, when Charles was four years old, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11.His childhood seemed idyllic, despite his perception of himself as a small and unimportant child.Charles enjoyed reading both outdoors and Robinson Crusoe and Gil Blas, as well as reading the

involves films that explore fantastical themes, such as magic, supernatural events, mythology, folklore, or exotic fantasy worlds.The genre is classified as speculative fiction, just like science fiction and horror films, although there are some similarities between the two.Magic, myth, wonder, escapism, and the extraordinary are frequently found elements in fantasy films.The URL is subject to change without notice.The movie location.The org/fantasyfilms is where you can find more information.There are multiple subcategories within the html framework of fantasy films, but the distinctions between these subgenres, as in fantasy literature, are somewhat fluid.High Fantasy and Sword and Sorcery are the two most frequently featured fantasy subgenres in movies.Both genres commonly incorporate quasi-medieval settings, wizards, magical creatures, and other fantasy-based elements.A more elaborate fantasy world and a greater emphasis on characters or thematic complexity are common characteristics of High Fantasy films.Frequently, they showcase an unassuming protagonist with a distinct distinction between good and evil, engaged in enigmatic battles.J. is frequently referenced by scholars.R.R.Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings novel is a prototypical modern example of High Fantasy in literature, and the recent Peter Jackson film adaptation showcases the popularity of this subgenre on the silver screen.The plot of Sword and Sorcery movies is more focused on capturing the action, much like high fantasy films, with a physical-action yet visually impervious warrior facing off against an evil wizard or other supernatural force.While Sword and Sorcery movies often depict a fierce battle between good and evil, similar to the conflicts in High Fantasy films, they may also portray characters with more immediate motives, such as protecting vulnerable maidens or villages, or seeking revenge.The 1982 film version of Robert E.In Howard's non-epic Conan the Barbarian, the hero battles against a magnanimous megalomaniac to seek revenge and rescue Vivienne, despite having fought off an evil knight.There are critics who prefer to use the term Sword and Sandal instead of Sargent and Sorcery, but they also argue that this label should be limited to fantasy films set in ancient times on Earth, and others would like to expand the category to include movies without any fantastic elements.To certain individuals, Sword and Sandal holds pejorative implications, referring to an otherwise inferior film with poor scripts, unsatisfactory acting, and inadequate production values.Contemporary fantasy is a significant subgenre of fantasy films that has gained increasing popularity in recent times.The movies depict the occurrence of magical effects or supernatural phenomena in the present-day reality.Although live action and animation are often mixed, such as in Disney's Mary Poppins, Pete'S Dragon, Enchanted, and Robert Zemeckis' Who Framed Roger Rabbit, two of these films are also considered to be musicals.Although Defending Your Life from 1991 is an example of a film that could be considered Bangsian Fantasy, fantasy films set in the afterlife are not as common.Historical Fantasy and Romantic Fantasy are among the rare subgenres that have been created, but the 2003 film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of Black Pearl successfully blended elements from both genres.Although they are distinct movie genres, superhero and fairy tale movies can be classified as subgenres of fantasy films, as previously mentioned.Despite its popularity, the film industry has not traditionally considered fantasy as dominant as it does science fiction films.There is no doubt that the low regard for fantasy films was due to the fact that they often struggled with inferior production values, over-the-top acting, and subpar special effects.The genre has gained newfound respect since the late 1990s, largely due to the success of J's adaptations.R.The R.J. and The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien.K.The Harry Potter books by Rowling."]], [[252, 'of which saxon kingdom was offa a king?', 'The Saxons, a group of Germanic tribesmen, were first recorded in late Roman times near the North Sea coast of present-day Germany (referred to as Old Saxony).They were soon identified as raiding and settling in various North Sea regions, while also moving towards the Franks.During the early Middle Ages, sizable sections of Great Britain were colonized and they were part of the Anglo-Saxon group that later united to form the first United Kingdom of England.Widukind, a semi-legendary Saxon hero, led the remnants of the Frankish Empire in their resistance to the expansion of Germany.The Saxons\' initial settlement site is thought to be Northern Albingia, which is roughly equivalent to Holstein.The Angles\' likely homeland was also present in this general area.The Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain during and after the 5th century saw the participation of Saxons, Angles or other continental Germanic tribes.The British-Celtic inhabitants of the isles commonly called all these groups Saxons.The number of Saxons who left the continent for Britain is uncertain, but it is believed that around 200,000 people arrived and settled there.The Middle Ages saw Saxons blending with the languages and cultures of the Baltic peoples, Finnic people in particular, and West Slavic people such as Polabian Slovaks and Pomeranians, while also having a significant impact on the North Germanic languages due to international Hanseatic trading routes and contingent migration.The Saxons\' name may have been derived from seax, a type of knife that they used.The seax has a lasting symbolic significance in the ceremonial emblem of Essex and Middlesex counties in England, where three seaxes are featured.Sussex and Wessex, as well as their respective names, possess a remnant of the term "Saxon".The Saxon name is believed by Edmund Ironside to have come from the Latin term saxa, which means "demonymous" in Celtic languages, while English words signify nationality in those languages.A loanword in English that is most notable is the Scottish Gaelic Saxon Sassenach, which is frequently used as a derogatory term in Scottish English/Scots.The name is derived from the Scottish Gaelic Sasunnach, which was originally called " Saxon" and originated from Latin to its English counterpart.The term is commonly used by Scots or Scottish English speakers in the 21st century as a playful way to insult others.The earliest written reference to the word in English is recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), with its publication date being 1771.Sasanach, the Irish term for an Englishman, has a similar origin to the words used in Welsh to describe the English people, such as Saeson and sing.The language and English in general: Saesneg and Seisnig.Cornish language uses the term Sawsnek to refer to the same origin.During the 16th century, Cornish-speakers used the phrase Meea navidno cowza sawzneck as a way to pretend that they were not proficient in the English language.The Scottish Gaelic term for England is Sasainn (Saxony).Examples of such groups include the Welsh Saesneg, Irish Sasana, Breton saoz, and Cornish Sowson.German immigrants who settled in southeastern Transylvania during the 13th century were also given the name " Saxons" (in Romanian Saşi).Some Saxons from Transylvania moved to neighboring Moldavia, as evidenced by the town\'s name Sas-cut.The Romanian region encompasses Sascut, which is now a part of Moldavia.The Saxony native, Georg Friederich Händel, was the subject of much discussion during his trip to Italy;The Venetians, particularly those who attended the 1709 performance of Agrippina opera, were greeted with the words "Viva il caro Sassone,  Cheers to the Saxon Shepherd!"']], [[253, 'in which 1956 film did actress gina lollobrigida make her debut in american films?',

was Smland, which is in southern Sweden.He primarily received his higher education at Uppsala University and began conducting botany lectures there in 1730.He spent time studying abroad from 1735 to 1738, and in the Netherlands, he also published a first edition of his work.He came back to Sweden and was appointed as a professor of medicine and botany at Uppsala.He was dispatched to Sweden on multiple occasions in the 1740s to survey and classify plants and animals.Throughout the 1750s and 1760s, he persisted in gathering and categorizing animals, plants, and minerals, publishing several volumes.He was a highly respected scientist in Europe when he passed away.The Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau conveyed to him the message: "I have never come across a more superior being on earth."The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe stated that he has only known Shakespeare and Spinoza among those who are no longer alive.The author of the poem "Linnaeus" by August Strindberg

teams of eleven players playing on the same field is known as cricket. The pitch in the center is rectangular and 22 yards long, with a wicket and three wooden stumps placed at each end for safety.The batting team endeavors to score as many runs as possible while competing against their opponents.The term "innings" is used to denote every stage of the game.When either ten batsmen are dismissed or a specific number of overs have been played, the innings concludes and the two teams switch sides.The team that scores the most runs, including any extras, during their innings is known as the winning team.The field of play is always occupied by eleven fielders and two batsmen at the beginning of each game.At the start of the game, the ball is delivered by the bowler from the fielding team to a set of wooden stumps, with the batsman being placed in front of it.The striker\'s task is to prevent the ball from hitting the stumps and score runs by striking it well.The non-striker batsman waits at the opposite end of the pitch by the bowler.The bowler\'s objective is to prevent runs and then discard the batsman, resulting in his departure from the field while another player takes over at the crease.The most common types of dismissal are bowled, which involves the bowler hitting the stumps with their legs and wicket, caught, or batting.The scoring of runs can be achieved through either striking the ball with enough force to cross the boundary or having the batsmen run in opposite directions while the fielders are retrieving the pitch.The wicket can be left out of reach by either batsman, resulting in a run-out as the fielder retrieves the ball quickly.On-field adjudication is carried out by two umpires.The ICC and MCC are responsible for upholding the rules of cricket.The formats available include Twenty20, which involves each team playing a single 20-overs innings, and Test cricket, where teams play two innings each over five days with unlimited overs.In the past, cricketers have traditionally donned white uniforms, but in limited overs matches, they opt for their team or club colours.In addition to their basic equipment, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury from the ball, which is made of cork and compressed leather.The origins of cricket are uncertain, but it was first recorded in south-east England during the 16th century.With the expansion of the British Empire, it became a global phenomenon and there were initial international matches in the mid-19th century.The ICC, the game\'s governing body, has a total of 100-members, including 10 full members who are Test cricketers.The international standard for women\'s cricket, played separately and in an organised manner, has been established.The world\'s second most popular spectator sport is cricket, which is predominantly played in Australasia, Great Britain and Ireland (GBI), the Indian subcontinent, southern Africa, and the West Indies.The origin of the word  cricket \'\' has been suggested through various sources.Creckett is the name given to the sport that was mentioned for the first time in 1598.The name of the item may have been derived from the Old English words cricc or cryce, which means crutch or staff.Birley\'s writing is located on the page.Three.The term "cricket" in Samuel Johnson\'s Dictionary was derived from the words "cryce", "Saxon," and "stick."In the Old French, the word criquet

temperate in nature.With 10 members, the republic operates as a unitary parliamentary democracy.With a population of 5 million, Prague is both the capital and largest city, with over 10.000 inhabitants.A population of 2 million people.Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia are the three historical regions that make up the Czech Republic.In the late 9th century, the Great Moravian Empire created what is now known as the Czech state, namely the Duchy of Bohemia.Following the collapse of the Empire in 907, the Pemyslid dynasty\'s center of power moved from Moravia to Bohemia.In 1004, the duchy was officially recognized as a part of the Holy Roman Empire, which later became known as the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 and reached its maximum size during the 14th century.The king of Bohemia had authority over the territories of the Bohemian Crown, was a voting member in the selection of Rome\'s Holy Roman Emperor, and Prague was the capital during the 14th to 17th centuries.In the 15th century, the kingdom was embroiled in economic turmoil due to the Bohemian Reformation and the Hussite wars, but it emerged triumphant in five declared crusades led by Roman Catholic Church leaders.The Habsburg Monarchy assimilated the Crown of Bohemia, the Archduchy of Austria, and the Kingdom of Hungary after the Battle of Mohács in 1526.Following the Protestant Bohemian Revolt against the Catholic Habsburgs, the monarchy consolidated its rule, reinstated Catholicism, and pursued a gradual Germanization policy, leading to the Thirty Years\' War.The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 led to the Austrian Empire taking over the Bohemian Kingdom and the Czech language\'s revival due to popular romantic nationalism.After the 19th century, the Czech lands became the industrial hub of the monarchy and eventually formed the nucleus of what is now the Republic of Czechoslovakia in 1918, following the collapse of Hungary after World War I.During World War II, Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany and then freed by the Soviet and American forces in 1945.After the war, the majority of the country\'s German-speaking population was expelled.In the 1946 elections, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia emerged as the winner.The 1948 coup d\'état led to Czechoslovakia becoming a one-party communist state controlled by the Soviet Union.A reform movement known as the Prague Spring was initiated in 1968 due to growing discontent with the regime, resulting in a Soviet-led invasion.Until the 1989 Velvet Revolution, Czechoslovakia was under communist rule and a multiparty parliamentary republic was established.Czechoslovakia disintegrated peacefully on 1 January 1993, and its constituent states were granted independence, resulting in the formation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.The Czech Republic\'s membership in NATO began in 1999, and it joined the European Union in 2004;The United Nations, OECD, OSCE, and Council of Europe all count it as one of its members.The country is characterized by advanced economic growth, high income levels, and excellent living standards.According to the UNDP, the country is ranked 14th for human development after inequality.The Czech Republic\'s democratic governance is impressive, and it ranks 6th in terms of peacefulness among countries.The European Union\'s lowest unemployment rate is found in it.Origin: The traditional English name  Bohemia\' comes from the Latin word ostensibly meaning "Boiohaemum", which means "house of the Boii".The current name is derived from the word ech, which was spelled as \'C\' before the orthographic change in 1842.The name is derived from the Slavic tribe, led by their leader ech, who was said to have brought them to Bohemia to settle on a hilly location on Pép Mountain.The word ech has its roots in the Proto-Slavic root * el-, which means a "member of the people";The term "a person" was derived from the Czech word lovk.The country has been historically divided into three regions, namely Bohemia (echy) in the west, Moravia (Morava) to the southeast, and Czech Silesia.']], [[259, 'jimmy wales and larry sanger founded which website in

1968.He spent his childhood in Anchorage, Alaska.His interest in philosophy began at a young age.In 1991, Sanger completed his undergraduate studies in philosophy at Reed College and later earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree from Ohio State University in 2000.The theory of knowledge, or epistemology, has been the primary focus of his philosophical writings.He has been engaged in multiple online encyclopedia initiatives.He was previously the editor-in-chief of Nupedia, the chief organizer for Wikipedia (2001-02), and the first one to serve as the founding editor in chief at Citizendium.He gathered the article development process from his position at Nupedia.Sanger suggested the implementation of a wiki, which resulted in the establishment of Wikipedia.Initially, Wikipedia was a companion project to Nupedia.He was the initial leader of Wikipedia\'s community and formulated many of its original guidelines.After leaving Wikipedia in 2002, Sanger has been expressing disapproval of the project.He maintains that Wikipedia\'s credibility is compromised, in part, by a lack of respect for expertise.A Citizendium encyclopedia, which is similar to Wikipedia, was launched by Sanger in October 2006.The expert-authored Encyclopedia of Earth was an early strategy created by Sanger, who also taught philosophy at Ohio State University.He has been involved in constructing educational programs for WatchKnowLearn\'s users.A web-based reading program called Reading Bear has been created by him to teach children how to read.He endeavored to launch Infobitt, a news crowdsourcing initiative, in February 2013;Without the code being ready for a full-scale launch, funds were depleted in mid-2015.Sanger\'s birthplace and early education location was Bellevue, Washington.His father was a marine biologist and his mother looked after the children.The family moved to Anchorage, Alaska when he was seven years old.His interest in philosophy began at a young age.Reed College was where he studied philosophy after graduating from high school in 1986.He became fascinated with the Internet and its publishing capabilities during his college years.He created a listserver to facilitate collaboration between students and tutors, offering expert tutoring and discussing tutorials.He initiated and oversaw a philosophy discussion group, the Association for Systematic Philosophy.The history of philosophy is filled with disagreement and confusion, as stated in Sanger\'s 1994 manifesto for the discussion group.In response to this situation, philosophers have expressed skepticism about the possibility of discovering the truth about philosophy or its existence.Yet, there is an alternative reaction: one may embark on a more meticulous and systematic thinking process than their intellectual predecessors.In 1991, Sanger completed his studies at Reed College with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy, followed by completing grad school with an M.A. degree from Ohio State University in 1995, and earning dmo.From 1998, he managed a website called "Sanger\'s Review of Y2K News Reports," which serves as an outlet for individuals concerned with the encroachment of the year 2000, including computer system managers.Sanger explored the possibilities of online education in 2007.His explanation was: "Imagine if education were not just delivered but also managed and monitored in a fully digital, decentralized, self-contained, synchronous, and distant manner."He added that there would be no bureaucracy governing anything other than basic rules, and decision-making would fall solely on teachers and students.Sanger, in an essay for the Edge in 2007, stated that there were numerous instances of Web 2.0.The revolutionaries are so enamored with the achievements of firm

Canal, who lived from 28 October 1697 until 19 April 1768, is also known as Canaletto.His proficiency as a printmaker in the field of etching was noteworthy.Between 1746 and 17656, the artist who created his urban landscapes in Venice was born to Bernardo Canal, a painter from England.His scenes are widely recognized, often linked to evocative depictions of the city.Sir George Beaumont presented his masterpiece, The Stonemason\'s Yard, in 1823/8, which was his most remarkable work from 1725.Canaletto, Giovan Battista Pittoni, and Giorgio Armini are the last of the Venetian master painters who were recognized for their exceptional talent in painting.The artist Canaletto, who is named after him because of his father\'s painting skills, was born in Venice and raised by Bernardo Canal and Artemisia Barbieri.His apprenticeship was completed by Canaletto, who worked alongside his father and brother.He started his career as a painter of dramatic scenes, working for his father.After being inspired by Giovanni Paolo Pannini, a Roman vet, Canaletto began painting the everyday life of the city and its inhabitants.Upon his return from Rome in 1719, he started to paint in his topographic style.Architectural Capriccio (seen 1723) in a private collection in Milan is the first work he has signed and dated.He quickly became the equal of his master when he studied with Luca Carlevarijs, an older painter who had moderate abilities and painted urban landscapes.In 1725, Alessandro Marchesini, who was also the buyer for Stefano Conti and worked as a painter, inquired about purchasing two additional "views of Venice" but was persuaded to purchase the work of Antonio Canale.The.The.The sun\'s radiance can be seen in this place, much like Carlevaris.Canaletto\'s early artwork was influenced by nature, rather than being painted in the studio.Some of his later works revert to the customary painting style, as evidenced by the use of a camera obscura to create blurry images of distant figures painted as blobs of color.Nonetheless, his artwork is consistently accurate as he depicted Venice\'s submergence in water and ice during different seasons.Canaletto\'s early and late works are still considered his most coveted pieces by many authorities.One of his initial works, The Stonemason\'s Yard (constructed in 1729 for the National Gallery in London), portrays a modest city-based workspace.Canaletto later created magnificent paintings of the canals in Venice and the Doge\'s Palace.The city\'s pageantry and declining traditions were reflected in his large-scale landscapes, which innovatively utilized atmospheric effects and strong local colors.His works were apt to anticipate Impressionism due to these qualities.The graphic design S. he created

assistance of Joseph Smith, a merchant who later served as the British Consul in Venice in 1744.As an agent for Canaletto, Smith first sought after paintings of Venice in the early 1720s and assisted him in selling his artwork to other Englishmen.The War of the Austrian Succession in the 1740s caused a decrease in British visitors to Venice, leading to disruption at Canaletto\'s market.Smith arranged for the publication of a collection of architectural etchings called "capricci" in his book Vedute Ideale, but the profits were not satisfactory, leading Canaletto to move to London in 1746 to be closer to his customers.He stayed in England until 1755, creating views of London, including the new Westminster Bridge that was completed during his stay, as well as the castles and houses owned by his patrons.Canaletto is depicted in his 1754 painting of Old Walton Bridge.']], [[261, "what is the name of the police chief in 'the simpsons'?", 'Hank Azaria voices the fictional character of Chief Clarence, Clancy Wiggum, in The Simpsons.The show\'s Springfield location features him as the chief of police.He is the father of Ralph Wiggum and the husband of Sarah Wigum.The character\'s lack of competence, responsibility, laziness, and gluttony as a police officer are the primary factors that contribute to his comedic value.Chief Wiggum\'s shenanigans are attributed to his fellow officers Eddie and Lou, who are more responsible.Biography: Chief Wiggum was originally from Ireland but moved to Springfield at a young age.The fact that Iggy served in Abe Simpson\'s infantry squad suggests that the Wiggums had relocated to America by the early 1940s, as depicted in Raging Abroad and His Grumbling Grandson.During the episode " Mother Simpson," Homer\'s mother Mona vandalized the laboratory of Springfield University, where Wiggum was serving as a trainee security guard.Burns was utilizing biological weapons.Wiggum\'s asthma was relieved by the antibiotics used to eliminate his weapons, which enabled him to become a police officer.The backstory of Wiggum\'s high profile in the police force, despite his incompetence, has been explored in many episodes.Just like the majority of supporting characters on the show, they serve as jokes for a single episode and are incompatible with each other.During the 2005 episode "Pranksta Rap," Wiggum was briefly elevated to the position of Commissioner of Police for Springfield\'s state.Ralph Wiggum, the son of Chief Wiggins, is adored by his father and receives some understanding of his peculiarities.Wiggum\'s descriptions of suspects, evidence, and location are frequently lacking in competence.His tendency to arrest people without considering their involvement in a specific event or crime is evident in shows like Brother from Another Series and The Frying Game, where he apprehended Sideshow Bob after being informed of his guilt by Bart and Lisa.He has been involved in the detention or confinement of individuals for an invalid cause on certain occasions.He attempts to arrest Grandpa in the episode titled " Midnight Rx" for shocking a police officer, rather than admitting to drug trafficking with Homer.The book "Louder & Stronger" features an episode where he orders Barney\'s arrest for accessory to bear charges.Additionally, in the movie  The Seven-Beer Snitch, he aids Mr. Burns in filling his recently opened prison with prisoners by restoring outdated and forgotten laws, ultimately leading to Homer\'s arrest for illegal litter disposal.When faced with a real emergency, Wiggum frequently fails to fulfill his police duties and occasionally disregards emergency calls.Sometimes, he will turn off his receiver when unable to fight crime or excuse himself for being too busy to help, which may lead people to believe that the police are involved in something minor.After losing his job, he sold his service pistol and demonstrated a lack of respect for the safety of firearms.The individual employed the Eighteenth Amendment by breaking up walnuts in a recipe (I Love Lisa) and devouring donuts from its barrel, almost taking his life in one of these instances (The Simpsons Movie).There are frequent hints that Chief Wiggum is involved in corrupt activities.']], [[262, 'the australian tennis open is played in what city?', 'Melbourne City Centre, also known as the Central City or simply The City,

not be mistaken for the broader local government area of the City of Melbourne.Melbourne\'s CBD is a significant financial center in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region, while the core central activities district ( CAD) of the inner suburbs and its major central business district are both situated within Greater Melbourne.Melbourne\'s Hoddle Grid, situated in the City Centre, is renowned for its intricate alleyways and arcades, as well as its distinctive blend of contemporary and Victorian architecture, with extensive parks and gardens surrounding its perimeters.Five of Australia\'s six tallest buildings can be found in the City Centre.In recent years, it has been recognized as one of the world\'s top street art destinations, alongside New York City and Berlin, and has also been designated a "City of Literature" by UNESCO in its Creative Cities Network.In April 1835, John Batman, a prominent grazier and member of the Geelong and Dutigalla Association, embarked on the schooner Rebecca from Launceston to search for new Grazing land in the south-east of New South Wales.He sailed from the Bass Strait to the Port Phillip bay and arrived at the Yarra River\'s mouth in May.Having explored the surrounding area, he met with elders from the Wurundjeri tribe of the Kulin nation and ultimately agreed to sell 600,000 acres (2,400 km2) of land.Batman\'s Treaty was signed on a scale of 940 miles.The transaction, which is believed to have happened on the Merri Creek bank near the present-day suburb of Northcote, involved a donation of blankets, knives, mirrors and sugar, among other items.The Wurundjeri is also recognized each year.This day marked the beginning of the charter that became known as Batman\'s final entry in his journal.The Treaty of Van Diemen\'s Land was declared invalid by Sir Richard Bourke, Governor of New South Wales, in August 1835, after he returned to the land.The belief held by Governor Bourke and Sir George Arthur was that the Aboriginal people did not have any official claims to the lands of the Australian continent.The proclamation formally established the principle of terra nullius, which stated that The Crown was the sole proprietor of all land on the Australian continent and had the exclusive right to sell and distribute it.Any unapproved agreements or treaties were invalidated, and anyone who relies on such a treaty would be considered an encroaching criminal.Nevertheless, when the declaration was being prepared, John Pascoe Fawkner, a well-known entrepreneur from Van Diemen\'s Land, had also contributed to the funding of an expedition to that place;The schooner Enterprize set sail from George Town.A second expedition was being sponsored by the Port Phillip Association at the same time;The Rebecca was

He is also the best friend of Charlie Brown.He made his first public appearance on September 19, 1952, but it took until three days later for him to be named.On July 14, he was first mentioned two months later.Linus\' first speech occurred in 1954, the same year that he was shown his security blanket.Charles M. is the creator of the character.The character Linus has been described by Schulz as being serious, intelligent, bright, and well-informed, which could be a factor in his insecurity.Lee Mendelson, the producer of most of the Peanuts TV specials, has revealed that Linus is his favorite character due to his intelligence and ability to act as a philosopher and theologian in the strip, frequently referencing the Gospels.The youthful features of his character are also exhibited;Linus is frequently depicted holding his blue security cover-up, which he often mocks by other characters for and causes him to suck his thumb.Linus claims that he created his own mythical creature, the Great Pumpkin, who is said to come to his pumpkin patch every Halloween and bring gifts.Linus is the only one who has confidence in the Great Pumpkin, but he occasionally convinces other characters that it is real, only to be skeptical when they abandon his belief.Linus had a significant lead in the polls for school president, but his discussion of the Great Pumpkin caused him to be almost eliminated from the race.Despite his opponent\'s insistence that Linus would excel as the school president, he was ultimately defeated by one vote.A parallel incident was depicted in a strip with the identical plot;The Great Pumpkin prompts Charlie Brown\'s inquiry, and Linus responds with an explanation.Linus claims that Charlie Brown is looking at him like he\'s crazy, prompting Brown to say "I could have been vice president!"The security blanket with a blue background, which was introduced in the June 1st 1954 strip, is almost always seen with Linus.He sucks his thumb while holding it over his shoulder.The habit is not a major concern for him.Roy, his friend, warned him during summer camp that he would be viciously taunted for it;As Linus reacted, he wielded his blanket like a whip and severed limbs in fear by saying, "They never teasing me ever again."It is evident that the blanket is an independent entity, despite its nonverbal cues.In a 1965 strip, it secretly attacked Lucy and banished her from the house because she repeatedly tried to dispose of it by throwing it in the garbage burner.After being reunited with its owner, it joined in the elaborate dance routine with Linus for the special film A Boy Named Charlie Brown.The absence of the blanket had resulted in Linus experiencing depression, panic attacks, sweating, and withdrawal symptoms.During the preceding strips, Linus developed such an intense emotional connection to his blanket that he would show physical symptoms if deprived of it for a short time.Despite being left weak and dizzy for an extended period after Lucy laundered the item, he eventually recovered when it was returned to him.Linus displayed comparable symptoms in A Boy Named Charlie Brown when he provided him with his blanket.Lucy buried Linus with his blanket on another occasion, as she tried to disrob him of his habit.The neighborhood was searched for by Linus for days until Snoopy finally succeeded in his mission.Linus is often possessed by Snoopy, who has used numerous tricks and subterfuges to get hold of the blanket, including having it delivered to his doghouse.']], [[264, 'the foxtrot, a dance introduced to great

of Wales and incorporated it into the English legal system through the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542.The 19th century witnessed the emergence of distinct politics in Wales.Lloyd George\'s Welsh Liberalism in the early 1900s was overshadowed by the rise of socialism and the Labour Party.The sentiment among the Welsh nation increased throughout the century;The formation of Plaid Cymru took place in 1925, and the Welsh Language Society followed suit in 1962.The National Assembly for Wales is responsible for a variety of devolved policy matters, established by the Government of Wales Act

one of the most extensive empires in ancient times, with an estimated population of 50 to 90 million people (about 20% of global populations), according to McEvedy and Jones (1978).Encompassing 6.A total of 5 million square kilometers ( 2).The area at its highest point, which was between the first and second centuries AD, was 5 million sq mi.Over the course of its roughly 12-century history, the Roman civilization progressed from a monarchy to primarily orthodox republics and eventually towards becoming an increasingly autocratic empire.Through the process of conquest and assimilation, it gained control over Southern and Western Europe, Asia Minor, North Africa, and parts of Northern and Eastern Europe.The Mediterranean region saw Rome's dominance and status as one of the most powerful empires in ancient times.Classical antiquity is often linked to ancient Greece, and the Greco-Roman world is characterized by similar cultures and societies.The influence of Ancient Roman society can be found in contemporary government, law, politics, engineering, art, literature, architecture, technology, warfare, religion, language, and society.The civilization of Rome was highly developed, with the city advancing its military and developing a res publica system of governance that served as inspiration for modern republics like the United States and France.Technological and architectural innovations were remarkable, including the establishment of a vast network to connect various roads, ducts, and bridges; there were also massive palaces (including those under the Alexander-Pompey complex), and public facilities.From the Atlantic to Arabia and from the Rhine to North Africa, Rome had taken control of all the territories around Europe by the end of the Republic ( 27 BC).With the demise of the Republic and Augustus Caesar's dictatorship, the Roman Empire was born.In 92 BC, the Roman-Persian Wars began with the first battle against Parthia, which took place 721 years ago.The conflict that took place was the lengthiest in human history and had a significant impact on both empires.The Empire reached its highest point of territorial expansion under Trajan.The decline of Republican customs and beliefs began during the imperial era, with civil wars becoming a common trigger for the rise of emperors.Splinter states, including the Palmyrene Empire, caused a temporary division of the Empire during the 3rd century's crisis.In the 5th century, the western part of the empire disintegrated into separate kingdoms due to internal instability and attacks by migrating peoples.This fragmentation is a crucial element used by historians to differentiate between the ancient period of universal history and the pre-medieval Dark Ages of Europe.The founding myth of Rome posits that on 21 April 753 BC, the city was founded by twin brothers Romulus and Remus, who were descended from Aeneas and were grandsons of Numitor of Alba Longa.Amulius, the brother of King Numitor, removed him from power, and his daughter Rhea Silvia gave birth to twins.The twins were considered half-divine due to Rhea Silvia's rape and impregnation by Mars, the god of war in Roman mythology.The fear of Romulus and Remus regaining the throne led Amulius to order their drowning.A she-wolf, or a shepherd's wife, saved and raised them, and they returned the throne of Alba Longa to Numitor when they were old enough.After founding their own city, the twins were killed by Romulus in a dispute over the location of the Roman Kingdom, although some sources suggest that the conflict was about who would take control of or give his name to the city.The name of the city was derived from Romulus.To draw people to the city, Rome became a sanctuary for the destitute, exiled, and unwanted.Rome's lack of women caused a problem, despite the high number of workers employed.Despite his efforts to secure marriage rights with the towns and tribes around him, Romulus was met with a deluge of undesirables who turned on him in Rome."]], [[266, 'how many verses make up the national anthem god save the queen?', 'Various Commonwealth realms, territories and British Crown Dependencies use the national and/or royal anthem God Save the Queen (or King) depending on their male or female ruler.The individual who composed the melody is uncertain, and it could have its origins in plainchant, although some sources attribute it to John Bull in 1619.It is the national anthem of the United Kingdom and one of two national flags used by New Zealand since 1977, as well as several territories in the UK that have their own local antshems.It has been the royal anthem for all of the countries listed above, as well as Australia (since 1984), Canada (decade 1980), Barbados, and Tuvalu.The music of "God Save the Queen" has been used as a basis for several patriotic songs in nations that were not under British rule, but is still commonly associated with royal ceremonies.The United States\' patriotic song  My Country, \'T is of Thee\' features the melody.Oben am jungen Rhein (Up above the Young Rhine) is the melody that serves as the national anthem for Liechtenstein.Many historic and existing versions exist for the entirety of  God Save the King/Queen\'s first verse, which is consistent.Since its initial release, various verses have been appended and removed from the text, and even today, different editions of each verse are available in different formats.Typically, there is only one line that is sung.It is possible to sing two verses, but on rare occasions, three are sung.The anthem is performed for the sovereign and his or her consort, while other members of the Royal Family who are entitled to royal salute (such as the Prince of Wales) receive only the first six bars.The Vice Regal Salute in certain Commonwealth realms outside the UK includes the first six bars entirely or as part of it.The g.The first six bars of the song  God Save the Queen, followed by the first four and last four bars at official events in Canada, are salutes for governors general and lieutenant governor (see Governors General and Lieutenant Governor respectively) as well as those honoring British overseas territories.The Oxford Companion to Music by Percy Scholes identifies dance tunes in the style of an early plainsong melody, with a distinct galliard-like rhythm, and provides examples similar to "God Save The King/Queen."A keyboard piece by John Bull (1619) that is reminiscent of the modern tune, where accidentals were left unwritten and laisséd in the player\'s discretion, was quoted by Scholes.He cites several works by Henry Purcell, including the opening of the contemporary melody that features the phrase "God Save The King."According to scholars and commentators in the 1800s, it is widely believed that the tune was based on an old Scottish carol called  Remember O Thou Man\'.Thesaurus Musicus published the first known version of the tune in 1744, which is comparable to the current melody.Charles Edward Stuart\'s landing in Scotland and England led to the popularity of his 1744 version of the song in The Gentleman\'S Magazine.Although the tune in this manuscript differs from that used today at multiple points, it is a strong relative of the contemporary anthem.The tune was reportedly performed in London theatres in 1745, with Thomas Arne contributing to its setting at the Drury Lane Theatre.Scholes\' analysis takes into account claims that are untenable and doubtful, as well as an American misattribution.Jean-Baptiste Lully wrote the tune Grand Dieu Sauve Le Roi in gratitude for Louis XIV\'s survival of an anal fistula operation, as mentioned by the French Marquise de Créquy in her book "Souvenirs".']], [[267, '"who was known in

Twelve Olympians include him, who is the son of Zeus and Hera.In Greek mythology, he is frequently depicted as the aggressive and wild aspect of warfare, unlike his sister Athena, who was known for her military strategy and general duties as an intelligence deity.The Greeks had conflicting views on Ares, as he displayed the kind of physical courage required for triumph in battle, but also proved to be a dangerous character, being unstoppable, indestructible, and even slaughterful.His war chariot was filled with the presence of his three sons, Fear ( Phobos) and Terror ( Deimos), as well as his lover or sister, Discord ( Enyo).His father Zeus declares himself as the most despicable god in the Iliad.Ares\' connection creates a sense of brutality, danger, or aggression in places and objects.The credibility of Ares as a war god is in doubt due to his loss during the Trojan War, while Athena, who was often depicted holding Nike at her side in Greek mythology, showed favor towards the triumphant Greeks.In Greek mythology, Ares has a relatively small role in literary works, but it is often mentioned about his multiple affairs and numerous offspring.Humility is a common outcome for Ares when he appears in mythology.He is famous for being the partner of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, who was wedded to Hephaestus, deity of manliness.The most popular tale about Ares and Aphrodite portrays them being exposed to ridicule through the deceitful hand of their mistress.The Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia and Haydock\'s book, The Book People, 1995, reveal that Mars is the Roman god who bears the likeness to Ares.215A father of the Roman people, he was given a more significant and reverent role as receptive god in the ancient Roman religion.The myths of Ares were reinterpreted by Roman writers under the name Mars during the Hellenization of Latin literature.Ares was the name used by Greek writers to document cult practices and beliefs related to Mars during the Roman period.The mythology of the two figures becomes almost identical in the classical tradition of later Western art and literature.The name Ares is traditionally linked to the Greek word (ar), which is an Ionic version of the Doric language, and is associated with bane, ruin, curse, imprecation, etc.The possibility exists that the Roman god of war Mars is linked to the hypothetical Proto-Indo-European * Mrs.Compare and contrast the Ancient Greek words  (marnamai) with those of "I fight, I battle": Ares is an ancient abstract noun that means "throng of battle" or "war," as noted by Walter Burkert.R.S.P.According to Beekes, the name may have originated from a Pre-Greek source.The name\'s earliest attested form is the Mycenaean Greek, a-re, which is written in the Linear B syllabic script.Other gods with a warrior aspect or involvement in warfare often had their names included Areios, which was an adjectival epithet.The term ares in the Iliad is a common noun that has been used to mean  battle.Enyalios is recognized as a god of war in inscriptions dating back to Mycenaean times and the Classical period.Ares was part of the Twelve Olympians in the ancient tradition represented by the Iliad and Odyssey, with respect to his character, origins, and worship.When Ares returns from the battlefield at Troy wounded and complaining, Zeus expresses a recurring Greek resentment towards the god.From my perspective, you are the most detestable of all the gods who worship Olympus.The act of fighting in battles is a constant emotion for you.Despite being my child, I won\'t tolerate seeing you in pain for too long since it was your mother who bore you.You would have been thrown under the bright sky if you were deified and believed to be born of a different

diplomat.During his tenure as the second President of the United States, he held the position of first Vice President from 1789 to 1797, and later acted as a Founding Father in leading American independence from Great Britain.During the Age of Enlightenment, Adams was a political theorist who advocated for republicanism and centralized government control.He regularly released his innovative ideas.He was a dedicated writer and journalist, particularly when he was with his wife and significant advisor Abigail.He collaborated with Samuel Adams, his cousin who was a revolutionary leader, but he achieved his own fame before the American Revolution.Following the Boston Massacre, he provided a successful and unpopular legal defense of the accused British soldiers, driven by his commitment to the Presupposition of innocence and their right to counsel.During his tenure as a delegate from Massachusetts, Adams was instrumental in driving Congress to declare independence.He aided Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and was its chief advocate in Congress.In Europe, he served as a European diplomat and assisted in the negotiation of an eventual peace agreement with Great Britain while receiving crucial government loans from Amsterdam banks.Adams' initial work, the Massachusetts Constitution penned in 1780, had a significant impact on American political thought, much like his previous Thoughts on Government from 1776.As a revolutionary, Adams was elected as the second president in 1796 and served as President George Washington's vice president for two terms from 1789 to 1797.During his one-term presidency, he was heavily criticized by the Jeffersonian Republicans and the Federalist Party, which was led by Alexander Hamilton's adversary.Adams ratified the Alien and Sedition Acts, while also strengthening the army and navy against an unannounced naval conflict with France.The primary outcome of his presidency was a peaceful resolution to the conflict that Hamilton opposed.Adams is commonly referred to as the father of the American Navy because of his firm defense strategies.He was the pioneer of U.S.S.The president's new residence, the White House, will be located in the executive mansion.Thomas Jefferson won the re-election for Adams in 1800, causing him to retire and settle in Massachusetts.After Jefferson retired, he resumed his friendship with him by initiating a fourteen-year correspondence.He and his partner founded a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians known as the Adams political family.Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams, who served as the sixth President of the United States.He passed away on the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence's adoption.His administration has been ranked highly by modern historians.The birth of John Adams Sr. on October 30, 1735, coincided with his early childhood and educational experiences (later renamed Old Style, Julian calendar).Between 1691 and 1761, Susanna Boylston was a resident from 1708 to 1797.Peter and Elihu were his two younger siblings.Adams National Historical Park preserves the birthplace of Adams, which

supercooling classifies them as either Bose or Fermi gases.The list of exotic states of matter is a comprehensive guide to understanding them.Elemental gases are the sole constituents of stable multiatom homonuclear molecules at STP, which consist of hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), and oxygen (O2).The halogens F2 and Cl2 are present.The monatomic noble gases are grouped with these gases;Helium, Neon, Ar, Krypton, Xe, and Rn are the materials that make up the He atom.The term used for these elements is "elemental gases."To differentiate them from chemical compounds, they are sometimes referred to as "molecular gases".The Flemish chemist J. was the first to use the term gas in connection with neologisms, and it has since been used widely in modern languages.B.Van Helmont\'s.According to the evidence, Van Helmont\'s word was probably a phonetic transcription of the Greek term  Chaos, with Dutch voicing and spelling variations. He therefore followed the alchemical usage that was first documented in Paracelsus.Paracelsus equated chaos with the presence of ultra-rarefied water.A different tale suggests that Van Helmont\'s word is corrupted from the word "gahst," implying the presence of a ghost or spirit.Some of the gases were believed to have supernatural origins, such as their ability to cause death, extinguish flames and occur in isolated locations like mines or minefields.Due to their inability to be directly observed, most gases are described using physical properties or macroscopic characteristics such as pressure, volume, number of particles (chemists classify them by moles), and temperature.The four characteristics of different gases were observed by scientists like Robert Boyle, Jacques Charles, John Dalton, Joseph Gay-Lussac, and Amedeo Avogadro in various settings.The ideal gas law was used to express the mathematical relationship between these properties, which were ultimately determined through detailed studies.Gas particles are more distant from each other than liquids or solids, resulting in weaker intermolecular bonds.Intermolecular forces arise from the electrostatic interactions between gas particles.Comparable charges in gases have opposite charges that repel each other, while similar charges are mutually beneficial;Gases that possess a constant charge are classified as plasmas.Gaseous compounds with polar covalent bonds exhibit permanent charge imbalances and experience strong intermolecular forces, even though their net charge remains neutral.Van der Waals forces are responsible for the electrostatic interactions that occur when non-polar covalent bonds between molecules are induced by random, transient charges.The intermolecular forces within a substance cause variations in their physical properties, which are particular to specific gases.This conclusion is based on the comparison of boiling points for compounds formed by ionic and covalent bonds.']], [[276, 'which former italian prime minister was kidnapped by the red brigade in 1978, and killed after 55 days in captivity?', "Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri della Repubblica Italiana or the Prime Minister of Italy, is officially responsible for leading the government of the Republic.The title was formerly known as Presidente del Consiglio dei ministri dell'Italia before the establishment of the Italian Republic.Benito Mussolini, Duce of Fascism, was appointed as the dictator of Italy from 1925 to 1943, assuming the position between 1925 and 1943.In 1943, King Victor Emmanuel III removed Mussolini from his position and Marshal Pietro Badoglio was reinstated as Prime Minister in 1943.In 1946, Alcide De Gasperi was appointed as the first Prime Minister of the Italian Republic.To carry out most political activities, the President of the Council of Ministers, who holds effective executive power, must be approved by the council and referred to as the prime minister.The office bears resemblance to those in other parliamentary systems, but the head of the Italian government is not authorized to initiate dissolution proceedings for the Parliament of Italy.Similar to other positions, the President of the Council of Ministers has the overall political responsibility for intelligence.The Prime Minister holds the sole authority to coordinate intelligence policies, determine funding, and enhance national cyber security.Maintain confidentiality among government officials;Permit agents to carry out operations in violation of the law, whether in Italy or abroad.The office was established by the Italian Constitution's Articles 92 to 96.The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister after every general election.The office of premier in Italy is commonly referred to as Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, which is the correct title.The office is listed in the formal Italian order of precedence as the fourth most important Italian state office, based on ceremonial grounds.The prime minister has additional powers beyond those that come with being a cabinet member, including the power to nominate cabinet ministers and sign laws independently.The prime minister of Italy is responsible for directing and coordinating the activities of their ministers, as per Article 95 of the constitution.In the history of Italy, the extent to which this power has been exercised has varied greatly, as it is heavily reliant on the political influence of individual ministers and their respective political parties.The Prime Minister's duties often involve facilitating communication between different coalition parties rather than overseeing the Council of Ministers.Despite the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle or no confidence vote, the Prime Minister's supervisory power is limited by the absence of formal authority to fire ministers.The Prime Minister is in charge of the Cabinet, which is overseen by the Council of Ministers.Furthermore, the Prime Minister is in charge of a major party and typically holds the majority in the Parliament.In 1848, the office was first established in Italy's predecessor state of Sardinia, although it was not mentioned in the Albertine Statute.The kingdom was ruled by ten Prime Ministers between 1848 and 1861, with most of them being right-wing politicians.Following the establishment of the kingdom and the Unification of Italy, there was no change in the procedure between Historical Right and Historical Left.The king appointed the candidate for the office, which oversaw a highly unstable political system.Camillo Benso di Cavour was appointed as the first President of the Council on 23 March 1861, but he passed away on June 6th of that year."]], [[277, 'what movie featured a cute mogwai that

bear mascot of speed record holder donald campbell?', "During the 1950s and 1960s, Donald Malcolm Campbell, a British national, broke eight world speed records by breaking both water and land speeds.In 1964, he was the sole individual to achieve both land and water speed records in the same year.Born in Canbury House, Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, Donald Campbell is the offspring of Malcolm Campbell, later Sir Malcolm and son of Dorothy Evelyn Whittall. He was a world speed record holder in Bluebird cars and boats during the 1920s and 30s.Campbell was a student at St Peter's School, Seaford and Uppingham School.He was unable to serve in the Royal Air Force after being diagnosed with childhood rheumatoid fever during the outbreak of World War II.He was employed as a maintenance engineer at Briggs Motor Bodies Ltd in West Thurrock.Later on, he was involved in the production of machine tools for Kine engineering, another small-scale engineering firm.The younger Campbell, with the assistance of Leo Villa, Malcolm's chief engineer, aimed to break speed records on both water and land.He wedded three times, first to Daphne Harvey in 1945 and then to Gina Campbell on 19 September 1949.Dorothy McKegg in 1952;Tonia Bern was visited in December 1958, and the relationship lasted until his passing in 1967.Campbell was an ardent fan of the supernatural, despising green and the number thirteen, and believing that nothing good ever happened on a Friday.As a member of the Ghost Club, he developed an interest in the paranormal.Campbell was a stubborn individual who seemed determined to imitate, if not surpass, his father's achievements.His outlook was generally positive and cheerful, until his crash at the Bonneville Salt Flats in 1960.The speed king's public persona was not without complexity, as he was both self-assured and vulnerable, and increasingly anxious about his future in the world.As a man of great patriotism, Campbell believed that his achievements were in the best interest of Britain.In the summer of 1949, Campbell began his efforts to break water speed records by renaming his father's old boat, Blue Bird K4, after it was previously used.His initial attempts during the summer were unsuccessful, but he did manage to improve his father's current record.In 1950, the team made a comeback to Coniston Water in Lancashire for further trials.During their stay, they were informed that Stanley Sayers, an American, had elevated the record from 141 to beyond K4's capabilities without significant alteration.During the winter of 1950 to 1951, Bluebird K4 was transformed into a 'prop-rider' instead of its original immersed propeller setup.One of the propeller blades was always out of water at high speeds as the propting hub became the third planing point, resulting in a significant decrease in hydrodynamic drag.She had two cockpits, with the second one being designated for Leo Villa.Bluebird K4 had the potential to surpass Sayers' record and also experienced success as a circuit racer, having won the Oltranza Cup in Italy during spring that year.In September, the Bluebird was put to the test again and managed to reach speeds of 170 mph, but a structural failure at that speed caused it to be wrecked upon return to Coniston.In Slo-Mo-Shun IV, Sayers elevated the record to 178 mph in the subsequent year.In addition to Campbell, John Cobb was also a potential contender for Water Speed Record accolades in Britain.He commissioned the Crusader, the world's first purpose-built turbojet Hydroplane with a maximum speed of 200 mph, and began conducting trials on Loch Ness in the fall of 1952.During an attempt on the record, Crusader split and killed Cobb later that year.Despite being devastated by Cobb's defeat, Campbell resolved to construct a new Bluebird vessel to bring the WSR back to Britain."]], [[279, 'in greek mythology, what was the name of the nymphs who tended the garden from where heracles stole golden apples?', 'In Greek and Latin mythology, a female nature deity is commonly known as nymphs, which are associated with varying landforms or locations.Unlike other goddesses, nymphs are commonly seen as divine spirits who provide life to nature and depict young nubile maidens with exquisite physical features such as dancers and singers.Their amorous autonomy distinguishes them from the repressed and sacrilegious wives and daughters of the Greek city.Many people hold them in high regard and they reside in mountainous areas and forests surrounded by lakes and streams.They were not necessarily immortal, but they could be subject to death in different forms if given the chance to marry a god and have fully immaculate offspring.Charybdis and Scylla were formerly known as nymphs.The retinue of gods, including Dionysus, Hermes, Pan, or Artemis, comprised other nymphs who were typically in the form of young maidens.Nymphs were frequently the subject of attempts by satyrs.Nymphs are recognized as emblems of the imaginative and nurturing activities of nature, which are commonly linked to the life-sustaining flow from springs, as noted by Walter Burkert (Burgert 1985: III).What is the purpose of this?The belief in divine nymphs and rivers\' divine origins is deeply ingrained in both poetry and ritual.The worship of these deities is curtailed by their inseparable association with a particular region.A young woman can be married in the Greek language, with its meanings including "bride" and "veiled."The word, Latin nubere, and German Knospe are all linked to a root that represents the concept of  swelling, as per Hesychius.The Greek nymphs were known for their spirits, which were bound to specific locations like the Latin genius loci. The complicated myth that brought Arethusa to Sicily illustrates this challenge in terms of transferring their cult.In the works of Greek-educated Latin poets, the nymphs gradually integrated the Italian gods of springs and streams into their ranks, while the Lymphae, also known as Italian water godses, could be identified with the Greek Nymphoe.The cult and rituals of individual nymphs were held in high regard by rural people in the springs and clefts, but it is doubtful that they were influenced by the classicization mythologies associated with Roman poets.The Roman educated class had a restricted scope of authority and were predominantly depicted as water-based deities.The belief in nymphs as per ancient Greek beliefs still endured in many parts of the country until the early 1900s, when they were commonly known as  nerdigeds.During that period, John Cuthbert Lawson composed the poem:.The.The.There is probably no town or village in Greece where women take precautions against theft and malice by the nereids, but many men still have stories about their beauty, passion, and recklessness.It is not solely a matter of faith;Several times I have been to villages where certain Nereids were known by sight, at least as they told others;Witnesses expressed a great deal of agreement with their description of appearance and attire.Nymphs were known to frequent remote areas, but could be spotted by solitary travelers outside of the village who could listen to their music and observe their dancing or bathing in a pool or stream during the midday or late afternoon.A whirlwind could be the way they appear.These encounters could be hazardous, causing individuals to become unintelligent, obsessed, mentally unstable, or tragically injured.Parents would pray to Saint Artemidos if they sensed that their child was feeling emotionally affected.']], [[280, 'when the 1992 maastricht treaty established the european union and led to a common currency in europe, what was the

Bros. background is one of the most disputed.The cartoon pantheon is second only to Bugs in terms of popularity.He aims to find Bugs, but his efforts often end in severe harm to himself and other hostile beings.His language is so peculiar that he always refers to Bugs Bunny as a "wabbit" by replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws.Elmer\'s signature catchphrase is  Shhh.Stay remarkably silent, as I am

Bugs.Duck and Rabbit!Together with Fudd, Bugs Bunny, and Daffy Duck.Before the character\'s most recognizable traits were established, Elmer was introduced to some of his characteristics by an older character named Egghead.A new character was introduced by Tex Avery, the creator of Egghead Rides Again, a cartoon short that was released on July 17, 1937.Tonopedia\'s website has a specific URL.You

original org/6iJt7bcDH.Initially, Egghead was depicted as having a large nose, humorous attire, resembling Joe Penner\'s voice (voiced by radio host Danny Webb or actor Cliff Nazarro), and an egg-shaped head.Many cartoon historians hold the view that Egghead transformed into Elmer after a few years.Michael Barrier, an animation historian, claims that the Egghead-Elmer story is somewhat disorganized, given that many individuals involved in creating or promoting the films had difficulty distinguishing between the characters and did not understand the purpose of their actions.In 1937, Egghead made a second appearance in Little Red Walking Hood and later collaborated with Warner Bros. in 1938.Daffy Duck, the latest addition to the animated series featuring Egghead, is a famous cartoon star.In 1938, Egghead was still featured in Warner cartoons on The Isle of Pingo Pongo and A-Lad-In Bagdad.In the 1938 movie A Feud There Was, Egghead was introduced on a motor scooter with the title "Elmer Fudd, Peacemaker" displayed on the side.Instead of a Moe Howard-style haircut, Egghead goes from hair to baldness and dresses in brown derby attire, slicked down the bottom of an old suit and high collar shirt.Daffy Duck\'s Quackbusters compilation film marked the return of Egghead decades later.He made a brief appearance in the final scene of Looney Tunes: Back in Action and was also featured in his own version, which included him and Pete Puma, in their comic book.It is believed by some animation historians that the Egghead character was influenced by Ripley\'s Believe It or Not.Robert Ripley, a cartoonist and entertainer, may have named himself Elmer Fudd due to his association with the popular hunter Elmers Keith.The Merrie Melodies series, which was originally one-shot characters, saw the rise of Egghead as the first recurring character created by Leon Schlesinger. Sniffles, Inki, and Bugs Bunny were also part of the series; however, Foxy, Goopy Geer, Piggy, etc. appeared in a few of them during the Harman-Ising era.The 1939 cartoon Dangerous Dan McFoo featured a new voice, that of Arthur Q.Bryan was hired to voice the hero dog character.The voice of Elmer Fudd, a well-known milk-sop voice actor, was created in this cartoon.Elmer Fudd\'s dominance in the Bugs Bunny cartoons has resulted in one of the most renowned conflicts in American film history.According to Barrier, Elmer Fudd was not a modified version of his fellow Warner Bros.The two characters

of 14th Street in Manhattan, with Greenwich Village, Little Italy, Chinatown, and the maleficent neighborhoods around the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges being included.The 1940s mobster history of Chicago is the foundation of Gotham, according to Neal Adams, a Batman artist.

'Toryism, a political philosophy, is rooted in traditionalism and conservatism from the British perspective.The English Civil War saw the Tory political faction come into being through the Cavalier faction.The politics of the United Kingdom and certain regions of Canada\'s Commonwealth of Nations are shaped by this political philosophy.The former British Empire had its own proponents, including the Loyalists of British America who opposed American secession during the American Revolutionary War.The Tory ideology has been encapsulated by the phrase "God, King and Country."The Tories typically support monarchism, have a religious background in the Anglican movement, and are against the Whigs\' liberalism.During the Corn Laws ( 1815-1846), most Tories advocated for protectionist agriculture, which involved the imposition of tariffs to promote sustainability, independence, and higher wages in rural areas.The Tory political group was initially established in the Parliament of England to secure the legitimist rights of James II, Duke of York, as a successor to his brother Charles II.The Exclusion Crisis, which was fueled by the Patricians, were involved in dealing with the issue of James being Catholic while the state institutions had broken away from the Catholic Church. These groups were the political successors to the nonconformist Roundheads and Covenanters.James II had two ministries that were affiliated with the Tory party.Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester, was in charge of the first order, and Lord Belasyse was responsible for the second.The Whigs were involved in the removal of James II to safeguard the Anglican Church or definitive protestantism, which was a significant cause.The Tories had a growing amount of support for the Catholic Stuart heirs to the throne after George I of Great Britain took power in 1714, but their numbers have been decreasing. Many of them were supporters of Jacobitism, which led to their loss and criticism in military operations.Although a small number of Tories were willing to support the Jacobite uprisings, they were exploited by the Whigs to discredit them and label them as traitors.A revival occurred after the introduction of the Prime Ministerial system by Whig Robert Walpole, John Stuart, and the 3rd Earl of Bute during George III\'s reign.By the late 1700s, Conservatism had emerged as a political philosophy and faction that combined moderate Whig economic views and various Tory social values to oppose the French Revolution.This was led by Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger.The hallmark of Toryism was the use of a powerful military and interventionist policies under subsequent Prime Ministers.Members of the Conservative Party, who may not be traditionalists, are commonly referred to as Tories due to their leadership in creating the party.Traditional Conservatives in today\'s society are often referred to as the "High Tories," due to their unique blend of traditional conservative values that distinguish them from the more liberal and cosmopolitan parts of the Conservative Party.The term  Tory\'s origin can be traced back to the Middle Irish word tóraidhe;In Irish language, the term tóra is used to describe an outlaw, criminal, or brigand, which comes from the word terry, meaning "purchasing," because pursued men were considered as targets.The term\'s first usage was to designate a Rapparee, but it was later used to describe soldiers who were Confederates or Cavaliers.Initially used as a derogatory term for an Irish rebel, the term was later adopted as political terminology, similar to "Whig."There was a dispute over whether James, Duke of York, should have been allowed to become the monarch towards the end of Charles II\'s reign.Initially, the term "Wigs" was used to describe Scottish cattle-drivers who were stereotypical anti-Catholic Covenanters and were targeted for excluding James due to his Roman Catholic faith.Those who refused to exclude James were labeled as  Abhorrers\'\' and later referred to as the repressed Tories.The term "Tory" was employed by Titus Oates to refer to an Irish robber, and it gradually broadened to encompass those who did not accept his Popish Plot but still sympathize with the Catholic Duke of York.']], [[291, '"which character who featured in the first ever edition of the radio programme \'the archers\' ""died"" in february 2010?"', 'A British radio soap opera called The Archers has been broadcasted on Radio 4 for over two decades.Initially promoted as an everyday tale of rural life, it has since been transformed into a modern drama set in the countryside.The radio soap opera has been running for over 18,000 episodes, making it the longest-running production in the world.With over five million listeners, The Archers is the most popular non-news programme on Radio 4 and holds the record for the highest number of visitors via the Internet. It premiered on January 1, 1951, and had a pilot that was also launched in 1950.Set in the fictional county of Borsetshire, England, the plot of The Archers is set in Ambridge, a fictional village.In the West Midlands, Borsetshire is located between Worcestershire and Warwickshire, which are both contiguous counties.The inspiration for Ambridge has been traced back to various villages, with the

and Monroe's white dress being blown up by the train are featured in one of the most iconic images of that era.The title phrase, which has been used by psychologists, refers to the state of being in a monogamous relationship after seven years of marriage, where one loses interest.The protagonist, Richard Sherman (portrayed by Tom Ewell), is a middle-aged publishing executive who is both nerdy and faithful, but also struggles with mid-life issues due to his wife's relationship with Helen and son Ricky.Ricky accidentally left his kayak paddle on the beach and he returns home to meet Marilyn Monroe, a former model and commercial actress who rents her apartment upstairs while in town to create television ads for toothpaste.That night, he was reading the manuscript of a book that includes Dr. Tanner's work.During the seventh year of marriage, almost all men are motivated to engage in extramarital affairs, as stated by Brubaker's brother, Oskar Homolka.In three imaginary scenes, Sherman tries to make Helen laugh because she finds him irresistible to women such as his secretary, nurse, and her bridesmaid.His lounge chair is filled with a tomato plant;After accidentally crashing off the balcony, the woman upstairs apologizes and Richard invites her to have a drink.He waits for her to get dressed, even wearing her underwear that she claims will keep her cool in her icebox.A drink

available in a variety of forms, such as liquids, powders and gels.Both commercial and home-cooked items contain food coloring.Food coloring is widely available and safe for use in non-food settings, including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals or other medical applications.The use of food coloring is linked to specific flavors, and the color of a meal can impact the taste of various foods, including wine and candy.Sometimes, the objective is to replicate a color that consumers can identify as natural, like coloring glacé cherries with red pigmentation or the appearance of Heinz's green ketchup

wine to enhance the visual appeal of their products.In European countries during the Middle Ages, agriculture was the primary source of economic activity, and peasants were accustomed to either cultivating their own crops or engaging in trade within village communities.The majority of the poor did not consider aesthetics during the period of feudalism.The emergence of trade, particularly the importation of valuable spices and colors, was a result of urbanization during the Modern Age.In 1531, a food law was introduced in Augsburg, Germany, that dealt with spices or colorants and mandated the burning of those who counterfeited saffron.The industrial revolution caused people to become dependent on foods made by others.These urban residents were in dire need of affordable food.Analytical chemistry was still in its early stages of development with minimal regulations.Food manipulation grew in abundance.The cost-effectiveness of using compounds containing inorganic elements was demonstrated by the ability to restore the color of watered-down milk and other foods, with red lead (Pb3O4) and vermillion (HgS) being common colors for cheese and confectionery.Copper arsenite (CuHAsO3) was employed to recolor tea leaves for retail purposes.The use of it to color a dessert in 1860 resulted in the death of two individuals.More than 80 artificial coloring agents, some of which were invented to color textiles and not foods, were sold by sellers during that period.There had been no testing conducted on many color additives for their toxicity or other adverse

were the origins of Project 949A нте.The NATO reporting name for the submarine is Oscar II.It was named after the Russian city of Kursk, which played host to the Battle of Arraskult in 1943 and is considered the largest tank battle in history.After the Soviet Union\'s collapse, the Russian Navy commissioned one of its first vessels, which was later included in the Northern Fleet.The building of Kursk was initiated in 1990 at Severodvinsk, which is situated near Arkhangelsk.Inauguration took place in 1994, and it was commissioned in December of that year.The second-to-last Oscar II class submarine was designed and sanctioned during the Soviet era.Soviet nuclear submarine technology reached its highest level with the Antey design\'s capabilities.The biggest attack submarines ever produced were these.The objective of its construction was to vanquish a complete United States aircraft carrier fleet.A Type 65 torpedo had a 450 kg warhead that could sink an aircraft carrier.The acquisition of nuclear warheads is possible for both missiles and torpedoes.The submarine\'s length was greater than any other Oscar I-class vessel, measuring 30 ft.The senior officers were provided with their own staterooms, and the crew had access to a gym.The outer hull made of stainless steel with high nickel and chrome content was highly resistant to corrosion and had a weak magnetic signature, which prevented detection by U.S. forces.S.MAD systems are used in the detection of magnetic anomalies.The pressure hull\'s thickness was limited to 200 cm.The plan was for her to be underwater for a duration of 120 days.The sail superstructure was fortified to withstand the Arctic ice.The submarine was equipped with 24 Granit cruise missiles, including SS-N-19/P-700, and eight torpedo tubes located at the bow.Granit missiles had a range of 550 km and could achieve supersonic flight at heights exceeding 20 km.The intention of their design was to inundate enemy ships and pick out individual targets that would then be sunk onto them.Torpedo tubes could be used to launch anti-ship missiles or torpoes with a 50 km range.Among her weapons were 18 SS-N-16  Stallion anti-ship missiles, which were designed to defeat the best Western naval air defenses.The Northern Fleet of Russia had been subject to funding cutbacks in the 1990s, and Kursk was one of them.Zapadnaya Litsa Naval Base, located 100 km from Murmansk, was where many of the submarines were rusting and anchoring.There was little to maintain except for the most critical front-line equipment, such as search and rescue equipment.The Northern Fleet\'s sailors were not paid in the mid-1990s.During her five-year tenure, Kursk only completed one mission, which was a six-month deployment in the Mediterranean to observe the United States Sixth Fleet\'s response to the Kosovo crisis during the summer of 1999.Fuel deficiency was the reason for this.Due to this, a significant proportion of her crew had only undergone brief sea experiences and were inexperienced.In August 2000, Kursk was involved in the first large-scale naval exercise planned by the Russian Navy in over ten years, known as the "Summer-X" exercise.The group consisted of 30 vessels, among them the Pyotr Velikiy flagship of the fleet (also known as Peter the Great), four attack submarines, and a smaller flotilla of smaller ships.Recently, the crew was recognized for their exceptional performance and was voted as the top submarine crew in the Northern Fleet.Kursk loaded a complete range of combat weapons into the exercise.The ship was one of the limited ones authorized to carry a combat load continuously.A Granit missile, armed with a fake warhead, was successfully launched by Kursk during the first day of the exercise.']], [[299, 'sofia helin returned on bbc4 in the third series of which scandinavian drama?', "The BBC operates a television network called BBC Four, which is accessible to digital television

defense contractor.The colonnashipyard.The Norfolk, VA-based Shipyard of Colonna.In the US, shipyards that are owned by the public serve as Naval bases, facilities, and services.To facilitate the easy entry of ships, shipyards are established near the sea or tidal rivers.The River Thames in the United Kingdom saw the establishment of shipyards, including those established by King Henry VIII at Woolwich and Deptford in 1512 and a later facility at River Mersey.In the late 1800s, Sir Alfred Yarrow established his yard on the banks of the Thames in Docklands, London, before moving it northward to the Clyde at Scotstoun (from 1906 to 2008).The Harland and Wolff yard in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where Titanic was built, and the naval dockyard at Chatham, England on the Medway in north Kent, are two other notable shipyards in the UK.The location of a major shipyard will feature numerous specialized cranes, dry docking facilities, slipways, dust-free warehouses and other services, as well as vast areas for building ships.When a ship\'s useful life is over, it embarks on its final journey to nimble dock in South Asia.Historically, shipbreaking has been done in drydock in developed countries, but due to high wages and environmental regulations, the industry has spread to developing regions.Around 2600 BC, the world\'s earliest dockyards were established in Lothal, Gujarat, India.The dockyards of Lothal were linked to an ancient Sabarmati river on the trade route between Harappan cities in Sindh and the peninsula of Saurashtra during the time when the Kutch desert was part of the Arabian Sea.A dockyard and a warehouse were given the highest priority by Lothal engineers to facilitate naval trade.Archaeologists regard the dock on the eastern side of the town as a feat of engineering of exceptional quality.The river\'s location was positioned away from the current to prevent silt, but it still allowed for ships to pass during high tide.The name of the ancient Greek city Naupactus is derived from its combination of several words, including "shipyard" and "building yard," which were composed of various items such as ships, boats, builders, and fixers.Naupactus has been a well-known location in this area for centuries, with legend suggesting it was the site where the Heraclidae constructed their fleet to invade the Peloponnesus.Barcelona was home to the Drassanes shipyards, which were in operation from the mid-13th century until the 18th Century, but they occasionally functioned as a military garrison and arsenal.It underwent frequent changes and refits during its operation, but a portion of the original eight construction naves and two of their original towers are still in place.A maritime museum has been established.Ships were the first items produced in a factory located in the Venice Arsenal, Venice, Italy, several hundred years before the Industrial Revolution.Almost one ship was mass-produced each day by the Arsenal, which used pre-manufactured parts and employed 16,000 people on assembly lines during its peak.']], [[305, 'conventionally treated as comprising a single order, which order of mammals lay eggs?', 'Mammals known as monotremes, or Prototheria, are creatures that produce eggs rather than giving birth to live young like marsupials and placental mammals.Australia and New Guinea are the only places where monotremes have managed to survive, despite evidence of their increased prevalence.Among the extant monotremes are the platypus and four species of echidnas.Monotreme taxonomy is currently a matter of debate.The cloaca is the source of the term monotreme, which is derived from the Greek words , monos and trema.Warm-blooded monotremes have, like other mammals, a high metabolic rate and similar traits.Pay attention to the details provided below.Do not have any hair on their person;Mammary glands are responsible for producing milk to nourish their offspring;Have a sole bone located in their lower jaw;Possess three middle-ear bones.Monotremes, like reptiles and marsupials, do not possess the connective tissue that serves as the primary communication link between the right and left brain hemispheres.In monotremes and marsupials, the anterior commissure carries all commissural fibers from the neocortex while in placental mammals, it only accompanies some of these fiber.The monotremes that exist as adults do not possess teeth.The occlusal surface of extant mammals is marked by the presence of a  tribosphenic form of their molars, which includes fossil forms and modern platypus young.Recent research suggests that monotremes have developed this molar form independently of placental mammals and marsupials, but this is not well-established.The jaw opening muscle in monotremes is distinct from that of other mammals due to their slightly different construction.Like all true mammals, the small bones responsible for sound transmission to the inner ear are fully embedded in the skull, unlike cynodonts and other premammalian synapsids.It is now believed that this trait evolved separately in both monotremes and therians, but there are conflicting opinions on its evolution, similar to the tribosphenic molar.Despite this, evidence from the extinct species Teinolophos suggests that monotremes and therians evolved separately from their own ear bones.At the base of the jaw, there is still a location for the external ear opening.Through the sequencing of the platypus genome, knowledge has been gained about the evolution of monotreme traits like venom and electroreception, as well as new features. The presence of 10 sex chromosomes in monoTREMES and their X-like resemblance to the xenotype of birds suggests that the two overlapping chromatic skeletons may have played a role in the evolutionary development of marsupial and placental mammals.It is believed that this trait, along with other genetic ties to birds such as shared genes related to egg-laying, may shed light on the origin of the synapsid lineage that gave rise to mammals and sauropsidas, which are thought to have diverged roughly 315 million years ago during the Carboniferous period.During the evolution of mammals from about 245 million years ago, the common ancestor retained egg-laying in monotremes and lost eggs in all other mammals.Although the trait is synapomorphic with birds, platypuses are still considered mammals and have evolved lactation with other mammals, as suggested by DNA.L-ascorbic acid is solely produced in the kidneys.The shoulder girdle of monotremes contains an interclavicle and coracoid, which are additional bones found in other mammals.The legs of monotremes are on the side of their bodies, resembling those of reptiles.The ankle area of the monotreme leg has a spur;The spur in echidnas is not functional, but the male platypus has a potent venom.The venom is produced from b-defensins, proteins found in mammals that are responsible for creating holes in viral and bacterial pathogens.']], [[306, 'what ancient civilization was centred in the north of ancient canaan, with its heartland along the coastal regions of modern day lebanon, syria and israel?', 'Lebanon (or)or.Lebanese Arabic is the language used.The Lebanese Republic and the Republic of Lebanon are the most frequently used terms among Levant government agencies.The term Lebanese Republic is a literal translation of the official Arabic and French names that is not commonly used in modern times.Lebanese Arabic is the language spoken by most of the population in Lebanon.;A sovereign nation in Western Asia is known as Lebanese Arabic: ).To the north and east of it are Syria, while Israel borders it to the southwest.The strategic location of Lebanon at the intersections of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland has facilitated the development of a rich history and shaped societal and religious diversity.The earliest indications of civilization in Lebanon date back to at least seven thousand years ago, well before recorded history.Lebanon was the homeland of the Canaanites/Phoenicians and their maritime culture, which persisted for more than a thousand years until their conquest.Between 1550 and 539 BC,The Roman Empire took control of the region in 64 BC, and it eventually became a significant hub of Christianity.The Maronite Church, a monastic tradition, was founded in the Mount Lebanon range.Despite the Arab Muslims\' conquest of the area, the Maronites maintained their religious beliefs and identity.Despite this, the Druze group established themselves in Mount Lebanon, leading to a religious divide that persisted for centuries.The Maronites regained their connection with the Roman Catholic Church and declared their communion with Rome during the Crusades.Their association with the Latins has influenced the region up to the present time.Between 1516 and 1918, the Ottoman Empire held sway over the region.After World War I, the empire\'s downfall led to the incorporation of the five provinces that make up modern Lebanon into the French Mandate of Lebanon.The French broadened the boundaries of the Mount Lebanon Governorate, which was primarily composed of Maronites and Druze, to include more Muslims.In 1943, Lebanon gained independence and established a political system known as confessionalism, which was based on religious communities.Bechara El Khoury, Riad El-Solh, Emir Majid Arslan II, and others are recognized as national heroes for their leadership in establishing the modern Republic of Lebanon.The withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon was completed on December 31, 1946.Since 1973, Lebanon has been a member of the Organisation internationale de la francophonie.Prior to the Lebanese Civil War ( 1975–1990), there was a time of relative tranquility and famous prosperity, driven by tourism, agriculture, commerce, and banking.During the 1960s, Lebanon was known as the "Swiss of the East" due to its wealth and diversity. This led to Beirut being nicknamed the Middle Eastern equivalent of Paris for tourists.Following the war, significant actions were taken to revive the economy and reconstruct the national infrastructure.Despite the challenges, Lebanon has the highest Human Development Index among Arab nations, except for the Persian Gulf\'s oil-rich economies.The name "Lebanon" is derived from the Semitic root lbn (-white), which may be linked to the snow-capped summits of Mount Lebanon.The name has been documented in various texts from the library of Ebla, dating back to the third millennium BC, as well as approximately 70 times in the Hebrew Bible and three of the twelve tablets found in an examination of two Palladium\'s Epic of Gilgamesh, which may have been as early as 2100 BC.The name Rmnn was mentioned in Ancient Egyptian, with R being the same as Canaanite L.From ancient times to modern times, the country was a member of several empires that included the Egyptian Empire, Assyrian Empire and Achaemenid Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Armenian, Sasanid Perm and Eastern Roman.']], [[307, 'what reptile, of which there are two living species, the american and the chinese, got its name from the spanish for lizard?', "Reptilia, which include turtles, crocodilians, snakes and amphisbaenians as well as their extinct relatives, are groups of tetrapods.The historical merging of traditional reptile groups with modern amphibian studies is the focus of herpetology.The Carboniferous period saw the emergence of the first proto-reptiles, which evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods that were more adapted to living on dry land.Early examples of this include Hylonomus and Casineria, which are lizard-like organisms.Extinct groups of various kinds, in addition to living reptiles, have been caused by mass extinction events.Pterosaurs, plesiods, ornithischians, and sauropodes were all destroyed during the K-Pg extinction, along with many species of theropous (e.g.g.Examples of the three groups are tyrannosaurids, crocodyliforms and squamates.g.Mosasaurids.With the exception of Antarctica, all other continents are home to non-avian reptiles.Testudines, turtles, terrapins and tortoises are among the many living subgroups that exist, with around 400 species included.There is only one species of sphenodontia (New Zealand tuatara);Over 9,600 species of Squamata exist, including lizards, snakes and worm-like creatures;Crocodilia, which include crocodas, gavials, caimans, and alligators; there are 25 species of these animals;Aves are a group of 10,000 species.The fact that some reptiles are more closely related to birds than to other reptils, such as crocodiles, has led modern scientists to advocate for the inclusion of birds in the monophyletic group Reptilia. There are currently over 10,000 species.Tetrapod vertebrates, which are either four-limbed or descended from four limbed ancestors like snakes, make up reptiles.In contrast to amphibians, reptiles do not possess an aquatic larva.While the majority of reptiles are oviparous, some species of squamates and certain extinct aquatic groups have viviparity. The baby develops inside the mother, rather than inside an eggshell.Amniotes utilize membranes to shield and transport their eggs, which enable them to reproduce on land without water exposure.Several viviparous species provide their fetuses with nourishment from placenta of different types, similar to those found in mammals, while others take care of their young first.The size of reptiles varies greatly, from the tiny Sphaerodactylus ariasae geckoe which can reach 17 mm to the large and powerful Crocodylus porosus, an extremely large saltwater crocodile that weighs over 1000 kg.The research conducted during the 18th century focused on classification, and from then on, reptiles were classified alongside amphibians.In Sweden, where the common adder and grass snake are frequently used as bait, Linnaeus included all reptiles and amphibians in class  III – Amphibia in his Systema Natur.The French preferred the term reptile (from the Latin word repere, which means creep in a native way) over amphibian, as both terms were widely used.The term Reptilia was first used by Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti to refer to an expanded group of reptiles and amphibians, which were almost identical to those of Linnaeus.Herptiles and the two groups are still commonly grouped together today.The distinction between reptiles and amphibians was not acknowledged until the early 1800s, when Pierre André Latreille constructed the Batracia class to differentiate them.Latreille's definition gained popularity among British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley, who subsequently expanded Reptilia by including various fossilized monsters like dinosaurs and synapsids.Huxley classified vertebrates into mammals, sauroids, and ichthyoids in his 1863 lectures at the Royal College of Surgeons.Subsequently, he suggested the names Sauropsida and Ichthyopsidas for the latter two groups."]], [[308, 'in which year did divorce become officially legal in the republic of ireland?', "Ireland;.A sovereign state

the state shares.Its surroundings are bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to its east, and the Irish Sea towards the east.A parliamentary republic operates as a unitary system of governance.The legislature is composed of a lower house, upper house (if applicable), and an elected President (elected at the legislative level), who has some important powers and responsibilities as the head of state.The Prime Minister, also known as the Chief Minister in Irish English, is elected by the Dáil and appointed by President, who also appoints other government officials.The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922 resulted in the state becoming known as the Irish Free State.The state was a dominion until 1937, when he became the head of state through an elected non-executive president and adopted the name Ireland in its new constitution.The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 led to the official recognition of it as a republic in 1949.In December 1955, Ireland was granted admission to the United Nations.The European Economic Community (EEC), which preceded the European Union, was joined by it in 1973.For the majority of the twentieth century,

friends, fifteen years later.Michael's therapist, Dr.Michael's intentions are suspected by Sam Loomis, who then heads to Haddonfield to stop him from taking his life.Despite being produced on a $300,000 budget, Halloween earned $47 million in the US and $ 70 million globally, making it one of the most profitable independent films of all time.The film is often cited by critics as the first of a series of revenge movies that were inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho ( 1960).Many Halloween counterparts were popular and spawned by the event, which also gave rise to certain clichés that can be found in low-budget horror films of the 1980s and 1990s.Halloween stands out from its imitators, as it contains very little graphic violence and gore.It was one of the initial horror movies to feature the concept of a killer dying and then being resurrected within the same film.The Library of Congress chose in 2006 to preserve it in the United States National Film Registry, citing its cultural significance, history, and aesthetic value.According to some critics, Halloween may promote feelings of sadness and misogyny in audiences who identify with the villain.The film has been criticized by some for being a social critique of the immoral behavior of young people and teenagers in 1970s America, with numerous instances of Myers' victims being sexually promiscuous substance abusers.Nonetheless, Carpenter repudiates such assessments.Although not a fundamental element of Halloween's plot, its techniques and plot elements have become established slasher movie clichés.In

between 1874 and 1876.The poem was deemed a tragedy by its illustrator, Henry Holiday.Ten individuals are involved in the plot to locate the Snark, a creature that could potentially be an intimidating Boojum.The crew member who found the Snark disappears quickly, prompting the narrator to state that it was a Boojum.The poem is a tribute to Gertrude Chataway, the young woman Carroll first met in Sandown, Isle of Wight, in 1875.The first edition of the poem contained several copies of Carroll\'s religious tract, An Easter Greeting to Every Child Who Loves Alice.The Hunting of the Snark, with illustrations by Henry Holiday, was published by Macmillan in the UK in late March 1876.The reviewers expressed their mixed reactions, with some finding it odd.The first printing of The Hunting of the Snark had a print run of 10,000 copies.By the end of the year, there were two reissues;Between 1876 and 1908, the poem was reprinted 17 times.Carroll frequently denied having knowledge of the poem\'s significance;He acknowledged one interpretation of the poem as an allegory for the pursuit of happiness in his 1896 reply to a letter.Scholars have identified multiple implications of the poem, such as existential angst, an allegory for tuberculosis, and a parody of Tichborne.The Hunting of the Snark has been referenced in multiple texts and modified for musicals, opera, plays, and music.The plot

established with Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Islamic nations.Datus, Rajahs, Sultans or Lakans were responsible for the establishment of various countries.Ferdinand Magellan's arrival in Homonhon, Eastern Samar, in 1521 initiated the process of Hispanic colonization.The archipelago was named Las Islas Filipinas by Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos in 1543, as a tribute to Philip II of Spain.The first Hispanic settlement in the archipelago was established in 1565 when Miguel López de Legazpi arrived from Mexico City.The Spanish Empire incorporated the Philippines into its dominion for over three centuries.As a result, Roman Catholicism became the most widely practiced religion.Manila was the westernmost point of the trans-Pacific trade that connected Asia to Acapulco in the Americas, using Manila galleons during this period.As the 19th century progressed into the 20th, the Philippine Revolution triggered the brief-lived First Philippine Republic, which was then followed by the violent Philippine-American War of conquest.The United States held onto sovereignty over the islands until the Philippines gained independence after World War II, with the exception of the Japanese occupation.Since then, the Philippines has frequently faced a chaotic history of democracy, with instances of non-violent revolutions overthrowing dictatorships.The country's status as a middle power is due to its large population and significant economic potential.It has been a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations

Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games to be free of disability, and the Youth Olympic games for teenage athletes.The IOC has been compelled to adjust to various economic, political, and technological shifts.The Olympics have shifted their focus from pure amateurism, as Coubertin predicted, to professional athletes.The rise in mass media attention resulted in the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games.The 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games were all cancelled due to the outbreak of World Wars.Participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games was

Greece, every four years, and they included religious and athletic celebrations.The representatives of various city-states and kingdoms in Ancient Greece vied for supremacy.The Games incorporated both athletic and combat sports, including wrestling, pankration, horse and chariot racing events.The Games were marked by a postponement of any conflicts between the participating city-states until they were resolved, according to many accounts.The Olympic peace or truce was the name given to the cessation of hostilities.The Greeks\' inability to cease their wars has made this idea a modern myth.The truce granted religious pilgrims traveling to Olympia the liberty to pass through the warring regions without fear as they were safeguarded by Zeus.The origins of the Olympics are both enigmatic and mythical;The Games\' ancestor is believed to be Heracles and his father Zeus, according to one of the most popular myths.The legend has it that Heracles was the first to refer to the Games as "Olympic" and established the tradition of holding them every four years.The Olympic Stadium was built by Heracles as a tribute to Zeus after he completed his twelve works, according to the myth.Upon completion, he marched in a straight line for 200 steps and named the distance as  stadion (Latin term "stadions" or "stages"), which later became standardized as measuring distance.']], [[313, 'after

chinese and baduk in korean?', 'Chinese culture has a long-standing tradition and can be traced back to thousands of years ago.The dominant culture area covers a vast territory in eastern Asia, with customary practices and traditions differing greatly across different regions, including provinces, cities, and towns.Chinese culture is characterized by its significance in areas such as ceramics, architecture, music, literature, martial arts, cuisine, visual arts (especially culinary), philosophy, and religion.There are 56 ethnic groups in China that have official recognition.The Han Chinese population is the most numerous group, in terms of numbers.Many groups have historically fused with neighboring ethnicities or vanished.Simultaneously, a significant number of individuals within the Han identity have upheld their own linguistic and regional cultural traditions.Zhonghua Minzu is the term used to refer to Chinese nationalism in general.The family name is a crucial factor in shaping the traditional identity of the community.Regional Traditional Chinese Culture is spread over vast regions, typically dividing each one into distinct subcultures.Three ancestral items are commonly used to represent each region.Chenpi, which is a blend of aged ginger and hay, is the representation of Guangdong.Other examples of ancient cities include Lin\'an ( Hangzhou), which has tea leaf, bamboo shoot trunk, and hickory nut.Such distinctions result in the ancient Chinese adage: "Because practice is within 10 li and customs are within 100.The structure of society has been under the main control of a Chinese monarch since the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors period.Different positions in society have different names depending on the eras of history.The hierarchy of imperial or feudal eras is comparable, with government and military officials being prominent, while the rest of the population is subject to customary Chinese regulations.Traditional Chinese society was structured into a hierarchical system of socio-economic classes known as the four occupations during the late Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BCE).The system did not encompass all social classes, and the distinctions between them became unclear following the commercialization of Chinese culture during the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE).The history of ancient Chinese education is extensive;The Sui Dynasty (581-268 CE) has been responsible for training candidates for the Imperial examinations, which have propelled them into government as scholar-bureaucrats.The establishment of a meritocracy was due to this, but only male candidates with sufficient financial resources could achieve success.The Imperial examinations required applicants to write essays and demonstrate their proficiency in Confucian classics.Those who cleared the highest level of the test were elevated to the status of elite scholar-officials, known as jinshi, which is a highly respected socio-economic position.The imperial exams\' mythology became the focal point of a major mythological structure.A shifu was typically responsible for teaching trades and crafts.The Lessons for Women in the Han Dynasty, written by female historian Ban Zhao, outlined the four virtues that women must follow, and scholars such as Zhu Xi and Cheng Yi elaborated on this.Cultural traditions include rituals such as Chinese marriage and Taoist sexual practices.Confucianism and Taoism are the primary sources for social values.The most influential school, as determined by the emergence of concepts such as Neo-Confucianism and Buddhism, is always a topic of debate.Rebirth and other rebirth concepts serve as a reminder of the connection between real-life and post-real life.The concept of guanxi, which prioritizes relations over rules, has been extensively documented in Chinese business culture.The official philosophy of Imperial China for the majority of its history was Confucianism, and mastering Confuan texts was the primary prerequisite for entering the imperial bureaucracy.Legalism is among the authoritarian tendencies that have had a significant impact.The philosophies frequently clashed.g.The Neo-Confucians of the Song Dynasty believed that Legalism deviated from the original Confucianism.In China, exams and a merit-based culture are still highly valued.']], [[315, 'prior to selling the team to current owner

By 1655, powerful yet cumbersome Keplerian telescopes with compound eyepits were being developed by astronomers like Christiaan Huygens and others.The device\'s patent application was first made by Hans Lippershey.The first practical reflector was built by Isaac Newton in 1668, which utilized a small flat diagonal mirror to reflect light onto an eyepiece mounted on the telescope.The design of a reflector with slitted convex secondary mirror to reflect light through \'a central hole in the main mirror\' was described by Laurent Cassegrain in 1672.Chester Moore Hall\'s unpublicized telescope in 1733 featured the achromatic lens, which significantly decreased color aberrations in objective lenses and enabled smaller and more efficient telescopes.In 1758, John Dollond started using Hall\'s invention to create telescopes in large quantities for commercial use after learning about it.John Hadley\'s invention of larger paraboloidal mirrors in 1721 was a significant advancement in reflecting telescopes;In 1857, Léon Foucault introduced the technique of silvering glass mirrors;In 1932, reflector mirrors were coated with durable aluminium.The Ritchey-Chretien version of Cassegrain reflector was created in 1910, but it wasn\'t until the 1950s that it became widely used;Many modern telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, use this design to provide a wider field of view than the classic Cassegrain.The use of speculum metal mirrors caused problems with reflectors between 1850 and 1900, leading to the construction of numerous Great Refractors that had apertures from 60 cm to 1 metre, culminating in the Yerkes Observatory refractor built in 1897;However, from the early 1900s, a series of reflectors with glass mirrors were constructed, including the Mount Wilson 60-inch and 100-inches (2.2 cm), among others.The Hooker Telescope, constructed in 1917, and the Hale telescope, built in 1948, both have a length of 5 metres;Since 1900, reflectors have been the primary means of generating new research telescopes.During the period of 1975-1985, several telescopes of the 4-meter class were constructed on higher altitude sites, such as Hawaii and the Chilean desert.The introduction of active optics and the development of the computer-controlled alt-azimuth mount in the 1970s led to the creation of a new generation of larger telescopes, including the 10-meter Keck telescope set from 1993/1996 and several 8-metre telescope series such as the ESO Very Large Telescope, Gemini Observatory, and Subaru Telescoscope.The discovery of an astronomical radio source by Karl Guthe Jansky in 1931 marked the beginning of the era of radio telescopes and radio physics.Numerous telescopes were invented in the 20th century to capture a diverse range of wavelengths, from radio waves to gamma-rays.The establishment of space observatories after 1960 enabled the observation of multiple bands beyond Earth\'s surface, including X-rays and longer wavelength infrared.The identification of optical foundations, lenses, and infrared sources was already established before the invention of the optical telescope;The discovery of simple lenses made from rock crystal has been documented in recorded history.In his Optics, Ptolemy discussed the properties of light, including reflection, refraction, and color, in the 2nd century AD.During the 10th century, Ibn Sahl, a Persian scholar, was expected to create some of the most detailed descriptions of optics.In Europe, "reading stones" and the use of lenses as burning glasses were both well documented from the 12th century onwards.During the late 13th to early 14th century, spectacles corrected by convex lenses were invented in Northern Italy, and the invention of concave lenses was given to Nicholas of Cusa in 1451 for near-sightedness correction.']], [[317, 'which city is sited on the absheron peninsula which juts into the caspian sea?', 'The Absheron Peninsula is a peninsula

is not entirely flat, with only a mildly rolling plain that concludes in Shah Dili, formerly referred to as the Absheron National Park.The peninsula is fragmented by ravines and characterized by numerous salt lakes in this area.The etymology of Absheron is composed of several elements.In the Persian language, the suffix "ab" signifies water, shour signified salty, and an imaginary plural.Abshouran, the words that were revealed, imply the place of salty water.The Russian city of Apsheronsk is also known by this name.In 1810, Conrad Malte-Brun suggested that the peninsula could be referred to as Okoressa.In terms of geography, the Absheron Peninsula is in close proximity to the Baku metropolitan area due to its location on the Abkhayt Peninsula with Khyrdalan population.The Absheron Peninsula has a temperate semi-arid climate with warm and dry summers, cool and sometimes wet winters that experience strong winds almost all year round.The most arid area in Azerbaijan is the peninsula, where the annual rainfall is around 200 mm or less.The majority of the mild annual rainfall happens outside of summer, but there are no notably wet seasons.The Absheron Peninsula is characterized by a dry steppe and semi-desert vegetation.The semi-arid climate necessitates irrigation for local agriculture.In the 1870s, the Absheron Peninsula became a hub for petroleum production, making it one of the world\'s earliest economic areas.The landscape is still scarred by the rusting oil derricks on many parts.The Absheron\'s reputation for its flowers, horticulture, and fruit like mulberries and figs is overshadowed by the serious environmental damage and pollution problems it faces.Local visitors flock to the northern coast\'s popular beaches, which are not clean despite being widely spread.Robert Nobel and Zeynalabdin Taghiyev are among the wealthy individuals who have migrated to the Absheron Peninsula.']], [[318, 'who is the vice-president for george w bush?', "George

synonymous.The wind-favorite name for Mykonos is the island of winds.Mykonos is a well-known destination for its LGBT community and vibrant nightlife, with numerous establishments catering to this demographic.According to archaeological evidence, the Neolithic tribe known as Kares inhabited the island in 3000 BC, but it was the Ionians from Athens who settled there in the early 11th century BC.The presence of a large population on the nearby island of Delos, which was only 2 km away, made Mykonos an essential source of resources and transit.In the past, the island was a relatively poor place with limited farming and only two settlements.Its inhabitants were polytheistic and worshipped a variety of deities.The Roman Empire governed Mykonos, and it was subsequently annexed by the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century.After the Fourth Crusade's destruction of Constantinople in 1204, Andrea Ghisi, a relative of the Doge of Venice, took over Mykonos.The Catalans caused destruction on the island in the late 13th century, but it was eventually taken over by Venetian authorities in 1390.In 1537, while the Venetians were still in power, Hayreddin Barbarossa, the infamous admiral of Suleiman the Magnificent, invaded Mykonos and an Ottoman fleet was sent to the island.A self-governance system, consisting of a governor and an appointed council (syndics) led by Kapudan Pasha, was enforced by the Ottomans.In 1718, the Ottomans captured the castle of Tinos, leading to the retreat of the Venetians from the region.Until the late 18th century, Mykonos was a prosperous trading center that attracted many immigrants from neighboring islands, as well as frequent pirate attacks.The main port of Mykonos was the site of a battle between British and French ships in June 1794.Manto Mavrogenous, the national heroine of the Greek Revolution against the Ottoman Empire, played a significant role in elevating Mykonos.A well-educated aristocrat named Mavrogenous, who was inspired by the Enlightenment's principles, sacrificed her family fortune for the Greeks.The year 1830 marked Greece's independence.In the center of Mando Mavrogenous square in the main town, there is a statue of her.Sailing and merchant trade contributed to a rapid increase in the island's economy, but it declined again during the late 1800s and after the Corinth Canal'inauguration in 1904 and the start of World War II.A significant number of Mykonians migrated from the island to secure employment in mainland Greece and various foreign nations, particularly the United States.The local economy was largely driven by tourism, which was made possible by the French School of Archaeology's significant excavations in Delos that began in 1873.During the 1930s, Mykonos became a popular vacation destination for many prominent artists, politicians, and wealthy Europeans.During the Second World War, Mykonos was briefly isolated, but in the 1950s, tourists again began flocking to the luxurious beaches and haven't stopped since.The Greeks named the region of Mykonos after its first ruler, Mykoskos, who was a local hero and son or grandson of Apollo.The island is believed to

270 stations and 250 miles of track.The system's name implies that only 45 percent of it is located underground, with a significant portion being visible in the outer regions of London.Moreover, the majority of southern Greater London's stations are not connected to the Underground, with less than 10% being situated south of the River Thames.Private companies owned the early tube lines, which were later merged with the sub-surface lines and bus services to create London Transport in 1933 under the control of the LPTB.London Underground Limited (LUL) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London, the statutory corporation responsible for the transport network in Greater London.Passenger fares account for 92% of operational expenses.Oyster, a contactless ticketing system, was introduced in 2003, following the introduction of the Travelcard ticket in 1983.In 2014, contactless card payments were made available.Many new station buildings, posters, and public artworks in the modernist style were commissioned by the LPTB, making it a significant patron of art and design.A schematic Tube map was created by Harry Beck in 1931 and has since been incorporated into other TfL transport systems, including the Docklands Light Railway, London Overground, and TifL Rail, which were later adopted as national design icons in 2006.The roundel and Johnston typeface, both designed by Edward Johnstone in 1916, are famous examples of the London Underground branding.The early years saw the proposal of an underground railway to connect the City of London with some of its railway termini, which was approved by the Metropolitan Railway in 1854.A short test tunnel was constructed in Kibblesworth, a small town with geological characteristics similar to those of London, in 1855 as part of the preparation for construction.This test tunnel was utilized for two years to develop the first underground train and was eventually filled up in 1861.Steam locomotives were used to haul gas-lit wooden carriages on the world's first underground railway between Paddington and Farringdon, which opened in January 1863.The service was lauded as a success, with 38,000 passengers on its first day and trains being borrowed from other railways to add to the fleet's capacity.The District Railway, also known as the Metropolitan District Railroad, was launched in December 1868, running from South Kensington to Westminster, as part of a project to create an underground inner circle that linked London's main line termini.The Circle line, which was built in 1884 by the Metropolitan and District railways, employed the cut and cover system.The growth of both railways was evident when the District constructed five branches that extended westward to Ealing, Hounslow, Uxbridge, Richmond, and Wimbledon, while the Metropolitan later expanded to Buckinghamshire, which is over 50 miles from Baker Street and the center of London.To avoid the need for a written contract with surface-based property owners, two circular tunnels of 10 ft diameter were excavated under the roads connecting King William Street and Stockwell for the City and South London Railway's first deep-level tube line.Electric locomotives that transported carriages with small, opaque windows, also known as padded cells, were introduced in 1890."]], [[323, 'what is the star sign of the date of

astrological signs are arranged as follows: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.The Babylonian astrology and Hellenistic culture both contributed to the development of the zodiac concept.The principle of  as previously mentioned and now below "" is used in astrology to connect celestial phenomena to characteristic modes of expression.Astrology\'s primary reference point for identifying celestial bodies is the twelve sector division of the ecliptic, which takes into account their positions.The ecliptic coordinate system includes astrological points that are dependent on time and place, such as the Ascendant, Midheaven, Vertex, and houses.The methods of measuring and dividing the sky are not uniform across astrology systems, but the Zodiac names and symbols have remained consistent.The measurement of the equatorial plane in Jyotia or Vedic astrology is based on the positions of Equinox and Solstice points, which are related to the length and duration of days in the tropical year.Precession in Western astrology results in the absence of zodiacal divisions that correspond to similar names in contemporary times, while the Jyotia measurements still match the constellations in their background.Astrology in both Western and Asian traditions emphasizes the significance of space and the movement of celestial bodies, including the Sun, Moon, and planets, within each zodiac sign.Chinese astrology emphasizes time over other factors, with the zodiac signs influencing years, months, and hours of the day.The Ascendant, which is the zodiac sign that rises on the eastern horizon due to the rotation of the earth, is a significant aspect of all three traditions.Although Western astrology is a product of Greco-Roman culture, some of its fundamental ideas can be traced back to Babylonia, including the history and symbolism of the Western zodiac signs.No Sumerian zodiac is mentioned, only the isolated celestial signs are mentioned.The Babylonian concept of dividing the ecliptic into twelve equal parts is particularly noteworthy.In the 4th century BC, the Babylonians\' knowledge of astronomy and celestial omens had an impact on Greek culture, while Egyptian astrology began to blend with it in the late 2nd centuryBC.The birth chart and horoscopic astrology were heavily studied, unlike the Mesopotamian tradition, which relied on the Ascendant and twelve houses.The association of the twelve signs with the four classical elements of Empedocles was a significant advancement in their description.Ptolemy\'s Tetrabiblos explains that astrological knowledge began in the 2nd century AD and spread successfully throughout Europe and the Middle East. It remained a source of reference for almost seventeen centuries, while later traditions saw little transformation in its core teachings.The table below displays the twelve divisions of celestial longitude, with their Latin names and English translations still being used.Due to their mathematical division, longitude intervals are closed at first point and open at second point.']], [[324, 'mary arden had a famous son. who was he?', "Arden's daughter, Mary Shakespeare, was born in the year.Between 1537 and 1608, William Shakespeare was born to his mother.Robert Arden was the father of a woman.The Arden family had a notable presence in Warwickshire prior to the Norman Conquest.She inherited Mary Arden's House, the farm in Wilmcote, Warwickshire, when her father passed away.

'The dialectical method, also called dialectics, is a form of argumentation that involves two or more individuals discussing varying opinions on nebulous issues and seeking to establish the truth through rational arguments.Although Plato\'s Socratic dialogues were responsible for the popularization of the term, the act has been a central point of European and Indian philosophy since ancient times.The word debate is not the same as dialectic.In theory, debaters may not have a strong emotional connection with their viewpoint, but in practice, they may exhibit an emotional commitment that can obscure rational judgment.The winning argument in a debate is dependent on whether the opponent is correct, convincing, or incorrect.A quick win or loss announcement is not always required in debates;It is common for a judge, jury, or group to come up with clear winners.The term dialectics is not interchangeable with rhetoric, which is a form of discourse designed to persuade, inform, or motivate an audience.The intentional use of concepts such as rational appeal, emotional appeal (such as  logos), and ethical appeal are techniques used by rhetoricians to convince an audience.The Sophists regarded excellence as the most important value and the key to one\'s actions in life.The Sophists taught the art of oratory as a means of demonstrating their aret.Oratory was honed as an art to impress and influence others through exceptional speaking skills;Despite everything, the Sophists instructed their students to seek aret in all activities and not just in speeches.Socrates believed that truth was the most important value, and he suggested that it could be discovered through reason and logic in discussions.According to Socrates, rationality was more important than emotion as a means of persuasion, truth discovery, and action determination.Socrates believed that truth and not being ignorant was the greater good, and that one\'s life would be shaped by the pursuit of truth.Socrates was against the Sophists\' teaching that rhetoric should be treated as art and emotional language without requiring any form of logic or proof.Throughout history, dialectical reasoning has evolved from the Indosphere and Europe.The forms that exist include the Socratic method, Hinduism, Buddhism, Medieval thought, Hegelish dialectics, Marxis law, Talmud theory, and Neo-orthodoxy.The dialectic method of reasoning is based on the principle of finding truth and resolving disagreement through rational discussion.To proceed, the Socratic method entails proving that a particular hypothesis and its associated admissions result in ambiguity.To this end, the hypothesis must be retracted as a candidate for truth.A dialectical solution to a disagreement is to reject the assumption of the competing thesis and antithesis;By proceeding to transcendence, one can complete synthesis, which is the third thesis.There are four concepts that underlie the fichtelian/Hegelian dialectics, which assert that everything is a temporary and unchanging entity that exists in time.Every aspect of existence is constituted by opposing forces.Gradual changes cause crises and turning points when a force dominates its opponent, while qualitative change is the outcome of quantitative change.The change is not circular, but rather helical and spiral.Heraclitus of Ephesus proposed the idea of dialectic, which refers to the unification of opposites and suggests that all things are constantly changing due to internal conflict and disagreement.Philosophy\'s history is rooted in the dialectical method.Barbara, Cassin\'s teacher (in ed.Paris : Le Robert & Seuil, 2004; Vocabulaire européen des philosophies.Transmitter 306.M.K.The ancient Greeks used the term " dialectic" to describe the logic of false appearance or resemblance, according to Kant\'s interpretation of Western dialectical forms.The Ancients considered it as a logic of illusion.']], [[329, 'on which label

Pop-influenced covers of R & B hits such as  Two Hearts, Two Kisses (Make One Love), Ain\'t That a Shame, and Yerlande\'s At My Front Door ( Crazy Little Mama).Boone\'s new sound was introduced to a wider audience through his All-American and clean image, as well as his traditional pop approach to rock and roll.Starting in the mid-1950s, Elvis Presley became a prominent figure in rock and roll history by making appearances on network TV networks, appearing in movies, and producing chart-topping songs.His unrestrained performance style and energetic renditions of songs, influenced by African American influences, made him both highly esteemed and contentious during that period.The music of the decade was contested by both Boone and Presley, with their distinct styles and images reflecting opposing perspectives.American Bandstand, a well-liked television series that showcased rock and roll musicians, gained national attention in 1957.The program, which was hosted by Dick Clark, helped to popularize the more wholesome, All-American form of rock and roll.Bobby Darin, Ricky Nelson, Frankie Avalon, Paul Anka, Neil Sedaka, Bobby Rydell, Connie Francis, and Fabian Forte were all teen

Neolithic Revolution, there were two instances of auroch domestication: one related to the Indian subspecies and resulting in the development of zebu cattle; and another from the same period.The other one is associated with the Eurasian subspecies, resulting in taurine cattle.The domestication of wild bovines, including wild water buffalo, gaur, and banteng, was also accomplished.Auroch-like traits

aurochs are believed to have descended from Bos acutifrons, an extinct cattle species.The oldest aurochs artifacts in India have been dated to approximately 2 million years ago.The Indian subspecies was the initial to arise.The species migrated towards the west and western parts of Asia during the Pleistocene era.They arrived in Europe roughly 270,000 years ago.The Thar Desert\'s border was home to domestic cattle, also known as zebu, that were descended from Indian aurochs.The zebu is resistant to drought.Aurochs are not the ancestral lineage of domestic yak, gayal, or banteng.An exceptionally well-preserved and archaeologically verified aurochs bone sample was used to publish the first complete mitochondrial genome (with 16,338 base pairs) DNA sequence analysis of  Bos primigenius in 2010.The aurochs are classified into three distinct subspecies in the wild.The Eurasian subspecies was the only one that endured until recently.The Eurasian aurochs, which were once known as Bos primigenius primi genius, roamed the steppes and taigas of Europe, Siberia, Central Asia, and East Asia.It is included in the Pleistocene megafauna, but its numbers have decreased with other species by the end of the period.']], [[333, 'if gordon banks was 1, nobby stiles was 4, bobby charlton was 9, who was 16?', 'A former England international football goalkeeper, Gordon Banks,

six occasions.He joined Chesterfield in March 1953 and participated in the 1956 FA Youth Cup final as part of the youth team.In November 1958, he made his debut in the first team and was later transferred to Leicester City for £7,000 in July 1959.The club\'s cup final appearances saw him make it to four, with losses in the 1961 and 1963 FA Cup finals, and then victory in 1964 for the League Cup, which included being a finalist in 1965.He became the top-ranked goalkeeper for England and played in every game of the 1966 World Cup triumph.Despite his success, Leicester refused to keep him and he was sold to Stoke City for £50,000 in April 1967.Despite making one of the game\'s greatest saves to prevent a Pelé goal in the 1970 World Cup, he was unable to play due to illness and lost to West Germany in their quarter-final match.The 1972 League Cup victory was won by Stoke, with him as their goalkeeper earning the club\'s only significant accolade.He was still the top-ranked player for Stoke and England until a car accident in October 1972, which resulted in him losing both his eye sight and his professional career.The Fort Lauderdale Strikers saw him play in the United States during 1977 and 1978.He briefly pursued a management role with Telford United, but resigned from the sport after being dismissed in December 1980.The club career of Chesterfield Banks was born in Sheffield and raised in the working-class Tinsley neighborhood of West Riding of Yorkshire.Following the establishment of an illegal betting shop by his father, the family relocated to Catcliffe village.Despite the increased prosperity, Banks\' disabled brother was targeted by thieves who stole from the store and passed away due to his injuries after a few weeks.After dropping out of school in December 1952, he assumed the role of bagger at a nearby coal merchant, which helped him develop his upper body strength.For a season, he was part of the amateur team Millspaugh F.A.Their regular goalkeeper was unable to make an appearance in the game;Banks was noticed by the club\'s trainer in the crowd and was given the opportunity to play in goal, as he had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys.His performances in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare resulted in a game for him, but he was dropped by Rawams and returned to Millspaugh.He became a hod carrier while still in school, having started at the age of 15.Chesterfield spotted him while he was playing for Millspaugh and offered him a six-game trial in the youth team in March 1953.In July 1953, Teddy Davison, the manager, offered him a part-time contract with compensation of £3 per week for his performance in these games.Banks\' decision to drop the reserve team into the Central League was based on an effective club director rather than merit, and his team ended up in last place with just three wins in the 1954-55 season.During his national service, Banks was posted to Germany with the Royal Signals and emerged victorious with his regiment.The Chesterfield youth team\'s success in the 1956 FA Youth Cup final was due to his recovery from a broken elbow.Manchester United\'s renowned "Busby

Tahiti Nui in its larger northwestern section and Tahisi Iti II in it.The island's volcanic formation gave rise to a high and mountainous environment, which is characterized by coral reefs surrounding it.The 2012 census revealed that the island has a population of 183,645 inhabitants, making it the most populous in French Polynesia and home to 68 people.The population is composed of 5 %.French Polynesia's economic, cultural, and political hub is Tahiti.The only international airport in the region is Fa 'a  International Airport, which is situated on the northwest coast and is 5 km from the town centre, and it serves as the capital of the collectivity, Pape'ete.Between 300 and 800 CE, Tahiti was initially inhabited by Polynesians.They make up roughly 70% of the island's population, while the rest are made up of Europeans, Chinese, and individuals with diverse backgrounds.Until its 1880 annexation by France, the island was under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Tahiti and was declared as a French colony.Indigenous Tahitians were not authorized to become French citizens until 1946.The Tahitian language (Reo Tahiti) is widely spoken, but French is the only official language.Geographically, Tahiti is the tallest and largest island in French Polynesia, which is situated near Moorea island.The location of this place is 4400 km south of Hawaii, 7900 km from Chile, and 5700 km away from Australia.With a width of 45 km, the island covers an area of 1045 km2.At 2241 m, Mont Orohena (Mou' a 'Orohanna) is the highest peak.The southeast region is home to Mount Roonui, also known as Mount Ronui or Mou 'a Rnui.The island is composed of two roughly circular sections, with the center positioned on volcanic mountains and connected by a small isthmus named after the town of Taravao.In the northwestern region, it is known as Tahiti Nui, while in the southeastern area, Iti (small town) is called Tai'arap.The coastal region of Tahiti Nui, particularly the capital city of Papeete, is heavily populated.The majority of Tahiti Nui's territory is deserted.Tahiti Iti remains isolated, with only those who can travel by boat or on foot to reach its southeastern half (Te Pari).A main road that connects the mountains and the sea encircles the rest of the island.A winding and scenic interior road offers a breathtaking sight of dairy farms and citrus groves.The north side of Tahiti is home to the Papenoo River and other streams, which are characterized by lush rainforests.Papeet experiences rain in January, which is the wettest month of the year from November to April.The month of August experiences the least amount of rainfall.There is little variation in temperature throughout the seasons, with an average range of 21 degrees.The temperature in Papeete is at its lowest point (16) and highest point (), according to records.Tahiti's prehistoric colonization dates back to around 200 BCE when the first Tahitian people arrived from Southeast Asia or Indonesia via the Fijian, Samoan and Tongan Archipelagos.Evidence from language, biology, and archaeology support the hypothesis of an emigration from Southeast Asia.Both Fijian and Polynesia are part of the same Oceanic sub-group, which includes all Austronesian Languages.The use of outrigger canoes, which were up to twenty or thirty meters long, facilitated the movement of

his estates in Chartley Castle, Staffordshire, and Lamphey, Pembrokeshire.The death of his father in 1576 resulted in the new Earl of Essex being placed under the authority of Lord Burghley.Trinity College, Cambridge accepted him as a fellow student in 1577;He completed his education in 1579 and obtained a degree;The year 1581 saw him completing his Master of Arts degree.The mother of Essex wedded Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who had been Elizabeth I's favourite and Robert Devereux' godfather for a long time, on 21 September 1578.Essex served in the Netherlands as a military member under his stepfather, but he eventually gained the Queen's support.He wed Frances Walsingham, the daughter of Sir Francis Walschingham and the wife of her late husband, Sir Philip Sidney in 1590, and they had several children, three of whom lived beyond the age of two.Sidney, who was Leicester's nephew, died in the Battle of Zutphen in 1586, where Essex excelled.Elizabeth Southwell, the mistress

showiness, and ability to please her.He took over as Master of the Horse from the Earl of Leicester in June 1587.Following the death of Leicester in 1588, the Queen transferred the late Earl's royal monopoly on sweet wines to Essex, providing him with tax revenue.He was appointed to her Privy Council in 1593.Essex failed to recognize the Queen's worth, and his subsequent conduct towards her was devoid of respect and disrespect towards Robert Cecil, her principal secretary.An insolent Essex was allegedly handcuffed by the Queen during a heated debate on Ireland problems at Privy Council, leading him to half-drag his sword against her.In 1589, he was part of Francis Drake's English Armada, which sailed to Spain in an unsuccessful effort to reinforce the English advantage after the Spanish Armatica victory, even though the Queen had forbidden his participation in the expedition.In 1591, he was appointed to lead a group sent to assist King Henry IV of France.The capture of Cadiz in 1596 was a significant moment for him.In 1597, he led the Islands Voyage expedition to the Azores with Walter Raleigh as his second in command, but failed to defeat the Spanish battle fleet by following the treasure fleet.During the 3rd Spanish Armada in 1597, the Spanish fleet arrived off the English coast, which caused panic as they were far away from the coast and had little protection.The Queen and Essex's relationship was further strained after he was appointed to lead the fleet against the Spanish threat.Ireland Essex's most significant failure was the appointment of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1599, which he convinced himself to take on.During the Nine Years War (1595-1603), there were no successful English commanders.Hugh O'Neill, the Earl of Tyrone, and

geometry are not colinear, they result in a distinct triangle and plane.e.An Euclidean space that is two-dimensional.The focus of this article is on the use of triangles in Euclidean geometry, except for specific instances.Triangles can be categorized by their sides, which are the same length as any other type of triangle.The term equilateral triangle is used to describe a polygon that has all angles equal to 60°.The lengths of both sides of an isosceles triangle are equal.The number of sides that are equal to i is used by Euclid to define isosceles triangles.e.Only two sides are equal.A different technique involves the definition of isosceles triangles based on their shared characteristics.e.Triangles that are equilateral and isosceles are examples of this type.Two angles of identical magnitude can be found in an isosceles triangle.The angles that are opposite to the two sides of a length.Euclid\'s knowledge of the isosceles triangle theorem reflects this fact.Some mathematicians define an isosceles triangle as having exactly two equal sides, while others define it as possessing at least two equally sided sides.The latter definition would mean that any equilateral triangles are equivalent to isosceles triangle.In the tetrakis square illustration, an isosceles-shaped rectangle with intervals of 45–45–90 is present.The lengths of the sides in a scalene triangle are diverse.In the same way, it has all angles of varying degrees.The right triangle can be a scalene if it is not an isosceles triangle.In geometric figures and triangles, side markings known as hatch marks are utilized to indicate sides of equal length.A side can be marked with a series of ticks, which are short line segments in the form of tally marks;The length of two sides can be equal if they are marked with the same pattern.The pattern of a triangle usually has 3 or more ticks.A triangle that has three sides is an equilateral triangle, while an isosceles triangle has only two sides and a scalene triangle with no equal sides has different patterns.Concentric arcs of 1, 2 or 3 inside the angles are used to indicate equal angles.An equilateral triangle has three angles with the same pattern, while an isosceles triangle only has two angles and a scalene triangle shows different patterns because no angles are equal.Triangles can be categorized by their internal angles, which are measured in degrees.A right-angled or rectangled triangle has a 90° interior angle.The hypotenuse, which is the longest side of the triangle, is situated on the opposite side to the right.The legs or catheti are the designations used to describe the other two sides of the triangle.The right triangles follow the Pythagorean principle by assuming that the sum of the squares of each leg\'s length and the hypotenuse\'=1 and b.The addition of properties to special right triangles simplifies the process of calculating them.The 3-4-5" right triangle is one of the two most recognizable shapes.In this scenario, the Pythagorean triple is 3, 4 and 5.An isosceles triangle can be drawn with two angles, each of which has a 45 degree angle.Oblique triangles are those that do not have a 90° angle.A triangle that has interior angles less than 90° is known as an acute-angled triangle.If c is the length of the longest side, then a and b are the other sides\' lengths.A triangle that has more than one interior angle of at least 90° is referred to as an obtuse or curved triangle.']], [[338, 'which city lies at the confluence of the rivers rhine and moselle',

last of which died when it was captured by the turks in 1453?', 'During the Late Antiquity and Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire in Europe continued as the Byzantine Empire, with Constantinople (now Istanbul) as its capital city.The Western Roman Empire\'s collapse and fragmentation in the 5th century AD did not put an end to its existence, which persisted for a thousand years before being conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1453.The empire held the position of Europe\'s most potent economic, cultural, and military power for a considerable duration.The Byzantine Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire are both historical expressions that were coined after the kingdom\'s demise;The inhabitants of the region continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire.It follows that;Romania and the Romans refer to themselves as "Romans".The division of the Greek East and Latin West in the Roman Empire occurred during the transition period from the 4th to the 6th centuries, accompanied by several signal events.The reign of Constantine I was marked by significant events.Constantinople was chosen as the new capital, the empire was restructured between 324 and 337, and Christianity was legalized.During the reign of Theodosius I,During the period of 379-395, Christianity was declared the official state religion of the Empire and other religious practices were prohibited.Finally, during the reign of Heraclius (r.),In the years 610-641, the military and administration of the Empire were reorganized and officially adopted Greek instead of Latin.Modern historians argue that Byzantium differed from ancient Rome due to its focus on Constantinople, Greek culture, and Orthodox Christianity, despite the continued continuation of Roman state traditions.The Empire\'s borders underwent a significant transformation throughout its existence, experiencing various periods of decline and recovery.In the time of Justinian I ( r.After reconquering much of the western

period of time.The Macedonian dynasty, which lasted from the 10th to 11th centuries, saw the Empire expand once more and witness the Macedon Renaissance, a period that ended with the Seljuk Turks\' takeover of Asia Minor in 1071 at the Battle of Manzikert.The battle paved the way for the Turks to establish themselves as a nation in Anatolia.Constantinople became the most prosperous and affluent European city by the 12th century, thanks to the Komnenian restoration that revived the Empire.Nevertheless, it suffered a fatal setback during the Fourth Crusade, when Constantinople was toppled in 1204 and the Empire\'s territories were split into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms.Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire was one of several small rival states in the region for the last two centuries of its existence.The Ottomans gradually absorbed the territories that were left over during the 15th century.In 1453, the Byzantine Empire was brought to a close by the Ottoman Empire\'s fall of Constantinople.The term "Byzantine" was first used to describe the later years of the Roman Empire in 1557, when German historian Hieronymus Wolf published Corpus Histori Byzantin, a collection of historical sources.The word was coined from the name of the city that Constantinople was known as "Byzantium" before it became the capital of Constantine.The city\'s older name would seldom be used after this point, except in historical or poetic contexts.Montesquieu and other French writers found the use of the term "Byzantine" to gain

Mauritius, Rodrigues located 560 km to the east, and the outer islands such as Agaléga, St.Brandon and two regions that are disputed.The Mascarene Islands consist of Mauritius and Rodrigues, located 172 km southwest of the French overseas department known as Réunion.The country's land area measures 2,040 km2.Port Louis is both the capital and largest city.The Middle Ages saw the Arabs and Portuguese visiting Mauritius, which was later named Dina Arobi and Cirne.The island was uninhabited until the Dutch Republic's colonization in 1638, when they named it after Prince Maurice van Nassau.The Dutch colony was deserted in 1710, and five years later, the island was renamed as the Isle de France of France.Mauritius gained the title of the Indian Ocean's star and key because of its strategic location.Prior to the Suez Canal's inauguration, Mauritius was an essential hub on the trade routes from Europe to Eastern Africa and participated in the protracted power struggle between the French and the British.The French were the sole fleet to emerge victorious in the Battle of Grand Port against the British, but they failed to prevent the landing at Cap Malheureux three months later.On December 3, 1810, the fifth day of the invasion, they formally surrendered on conditions that granted settlers the right to keep their land and property, as well as the French language and French law in criminal and civil matters.The island was the primary source of sugar production for the British Empire during their reign.The 20th century witnessed the emergence of organized movements that sought to enhance labor laws and implement political reforms, which gained momentum after World War II.The country gained independence when a new constitution was adopted on 12 March 1968.The Commonwealth of Nations recognized Mauritius as a republic in 1992.The Chagos Archipelago is a territorial dispute between Mauritius and the UK.The UK expelled the archipelago from Mauritian territory before granting independence in 1965.The indigenous population of the archipelago was gradually depopulated, and Diego Garcia Island, its largest island, was leased to the United States.Tromelin Island is also claimed by Mauritius as a French territory.The people of Mauritius are diverse, multicultural, multi-lingual, and multireligious.The government of Mauritius is heavily influenced by the Westminster parliamentary system, which has led to its high reputation for democracy and economic and political freedom.Mauritius is known for its diverse flora and fauna, which include many species that are unique to the Mascarene Islands.The island is reputed to be the sole recognized habitat of the dodo, which, along with other birds, perished due to human activities in a short period after its settlement.In 1502, Alberto Cantino, an Italian cartographer, created a map that provides evidence of Mauritius's existence as an island.Arab sailors were the first to call Mauritius Dina Arobi during the Middle Ages, as indicated by this fact.The island was left unoccupied by Portuguese sailors in 1507.The island's name is indicated as Cirne on early maps of Portugal, which implies that it was named after a ship during the 1507 expedition.The Archipelago was christened Mascarenes by Dom Pedro Mascarenhas, who was also a Portuguese sailorsman.Admiral Wybrand van Warwyck led a Dutch squadron to land at Grand Port in 1598 and named the island Mauritius, after Prince Maurice van Nassau, stadholder of the Dutch Republic.Following its colonization by the French, the island was renamed Isle de France.The island was surrendered by the French on 3 December 1810 during the Napoleonic Wars.The island's name was reverted to Mauritius during the British occupation.Mauritius is

is derived from Medieval Latin and typically signifies the same year as our Lord."The term can be more accurately referred to as "( or Jesu )" (in the year of Our Lord Jesus Christ).The AD system, which counts the years since Christ\'s birth, was introduced by Dionysius Exiguus of Scythia Minor in AD 525.The traditional year of the conception or birth of Jesus of Nazareth is used to calculate the era\'s duration, with AD and BC starting from this date.The year AD 1 is immediately followed by the year 1 BC in this system, as there is no year zero.The emergence of this dating system occurred in 525, but it was not widely adopted until the 8th century.The Gregorian calendar is the most commonly used calendar in the world today.It has been the unofficial global standard for many years, used in the practical context of international communication, transportation and commercial integration, and is recognized by international institutions such as the United Nations.In the past, English has traditionally used the abbreviation  AD\'s before the year number in Latin.BC is positioned after the year number, such as AD but not 68 BC, which also ensures proper syntactic organization.After a century or millennium, the abbreviation is commonly employed, such as "AD 400" or "AAD 200," which was previously considered offensive in conservative usage.Due to the English abbreviation of Before Christ, AD is sometimes mistakenly referred to as After Death.e.Following the death of Jesus.The time scales of the BC and AD would not account for the roughly 33 years that Jesus\' life was commonly referred to.A terminology that some consider to be more neutral and inclusive of non-Christians is known as the Current or Common Era.E.The preceding years are referred to as Before the Common, Christian, or Current Era ( BCE or B).C.E.)The numbering of astronomical years and ISO 8601 guidelines avoid using Christian abbreviations or words, but adhere to the same numerical values for AD years.Dionysius Exiguus created the Anno Domini dating system in 525 to determine the number of years on his Easter table.The Diocletian era that was once discussed in an old Easter table would be replaced by his system, as he did not want to perpetuate the image of a dictator who persecuted Christians.AD 532 marked the beginning of his table, which was preceded by the last year of Diocletian 247.At the time he created his table, Julian calendar years were identified by naming which consuls were in office that year—He himself stated that the current year was "consulship of Probus Junior", 525 years after Christ\'s incarnation.Dionysius proposed that Jesus\' Incarnation took place 525 years earlier, but did not specify the exact year of his birth or conception.Despite the absence of any references to other dating systems, Dionysius\' table does not provide any indication of his time period, whether it be consul, Olympiad, year of the world, or Augustus’ regnal year.He neglects to clarify or rationalize the underlying date.Blackburn & Holford-Strevens provide brief arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC or AD 1 as the year in which Dionysius intended to create either the Nativity or Incarnation.Among the confusions, Incarnation is now considered to be synonymous with conception, but some ancient writers like Bede believed that it was actually connected to the Nativity.']], [[353,

characteristic of impacted royalty that is evident in the personalities of many individuals who perform in drag, whether it\'s their own personality or a staged character.The term is also connected to the Old English word  quean or cwene, which originally meant woman, but was later used as a label for promiscuous women and gay men.The OE word that comes from Middle Dutch quene (old woman) and Proto-Germanic * kwen (woman \'\') as well as Proto-Indo–European * "gwyn" (sheer woman") is the source of the OT word.The origins of the term drag as used to describe women\'s clothing worn by men

possible that the word originated from the Romani term for skirt, which is present in various Northern European Romanized dialects such as daraka and jendraka.The term female impersonator, which is

at the midpoint between the four cardinal directions make up the compass points.The directions that are intermediate, intercardinal or ordinal, are northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NO).The secondary-intercardinal direction is the intermediate direction between intercardinating and cardinal directions, with the eight shortest points in the compass rising to the

confusing.By keeping oneself within a great circle, the bearing may alter.The North Pole's direction changes abruptly when a straight line crosses it.The Equator is the only place where one can travel

from left to right and from right to left.The sun's shadows can be observed.If they move in the opposite direction, the sun will be in south at midday and turn north.Because of Earth's axial tilt, there are only two days annually when the sun rises precisely due east, regardless of the location.These days, it is the equinoxes.Depending on the time of year, the sun's rising and setting are either in the direction of true east or west.Across all locations, the sun rises in a north-east direction and sets in an east-west direction from North to South.A more precise answer can be obtained

centuries.As a result of the Belgian state reforms in the late 20th century, the region was divided into two political entities: the Flemish Community and the Region.The Flemish Community, which has a wider cultural mandate, is located in Brussels, but the Fleming Region is not.Flanders has played a significant role in European history.Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp, and Brussels were among the wealthiest and most urbanized areas in Europe during the late Middle Ages, where they processed the wool of neighbouring lands into textiles for both domestic and export markets.This led to the development of a highly sophisticated culture, with remarkable accomplishments in the arts and architecture that were on par with those of northern Italy.Despite being a hub of the industrial revolution in the 19th century, Flanders was initially overtaken by French-speaking Wallonia.The economy of Flanders underwent rapid modernization in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to a much higher level of

which forms its own Region, while the latter does.Flemish Government and legislative bodies are both governed by political institutions.Located in the center of the historic County of Flanders are West Fleur and East Floreur, the westernmost provinces of this historically significant Flemish Region.From the 8th century Flandria to its absorption by the French First Republic, Belgium and its neighboring countries were under a feudal administration.This county also covered parts of France and the Netherlands until the 1600s.The Nord department of Flanders was one of the areas that the French conquered during their conquest.French Flanders can be further divided into two regions: Lilloise Florosa and Maritime Flers.The first region was predominantly French-speaking by the 1600s, but this changed in the 20th century.The Flemish identity of Lille is evident in the name of its local railway station, TGV Lille Flandres."]], [[361, 'the asian tsunami or boxing day tsunami that hit

magnitude of the shock was 9 for one second.1 to 9IX (Violent) with a maximum Mercalli intensity of 3.The Burma Plate's subduction of the Indian Plate resulted in a megathrust earthquake, which caused tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the ocean, killing 230,000 people in 14 countries and inundating coastal communities with waves up to 30 m high.The natural disaster was one of the most catastrophic in recorded history.Indonesia suffered the most damage, with Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand following closely behind.The earthquake that had the longest faulting observed in recorded history, spanning 8.A duration of 3 and 10 minutes.Up to 1 cm of vibrations were caused on the planet, with other earthquakes occurring in Alaska.The center of gravity was positioned between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia.The distress of the populace and nations led to a global humanitarian response.More than US $ 14 billion in humanitarian aid was donated by the international community in 2004.Scientifically speaking, the quake between Sumatra and Andaman is known as such.The tsunami that ensued was referred to by different names, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, South Asia's tsunami (SAS), Indonesian tsunami (1945), Christmas tsunami and Boxing Day tsunami.The initial earthquake's characteristics were attributed to the moment magnitude 8.8.The magnitude was revised to 9 by scientists in February 2005.A zero score.Despite the acceptance of new numbers by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, the United States Geological Survey has maintained its original estimate of

good representative number for the magnitude of this major earthquake is 2.The hypocentre of the primary earthquake was located in the Indian Ocean, approximately 160 km off the western coast of Sumatra, and just north of Simeulue island, at a depth of 30 km below the initial reading of 10 km.Over a distance of 1300 km, the Sunda megathrust burst in its northern part.The earthquake and tsunami that followed occurred simultaneously in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, and the Maldives.Splay faults, which are secondary to the primary sea floor failures that

and the Alpide belt, which runs from Sumatra to Java and then westward to Bali and Flores, are where Indonesia is located.A significant portion of the global earthquake moment can be attributed to seismic moments associated with megathrust events in subduction zones, such as the Sumatra-Andaman event.The Sumatra-Andaman event was responsible for approximately one-eight of every 100 seismic moments released by earthquakes between 1906 and 2005.This quake, along with the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska and the Great Chilean earthquake that occurred in 1960, accounts for almost half of the total moment.The diagram provides a perspective of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which was much smaller but still catastrophic.The moment magnitude scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake, which is represented by Mw.Since 1900, the only earthquakes with a higher magnitude have been the Great Chilean earthquake (9.5) in 1960.The 1964 Good Friday earthquake in Prince William

which stands for Security Service of the Reichsführers-SS and Nazi Party, was a spy agency in Nazi Germany.The initial Nazi Party intelligence organization was established and regarded as a sister entity to the Gestapo, which had been heavily infiltrated by the SS since 1934.The SD was a separate SS office from 1933 to 1939, but it was later placed under the supervision of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt.RSHA is one of the seven departments/offices it operates.Reinhard Heydrich, the first director of the SD, aimed to ensure that every individual within the Third Reich was under constant supervision.The SD and Heydrich\'s RSHA, including the Gestapo, were labeled as criminal organizations at the Nuremberg Trials after Germany\'S defeat in World War II.In 1946, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, who took over from Heydrich, was hanged after being sentenced to death for war crimes at the Nuremberg Tribunals.Initially known as the SD, the Security Département (SD) was established in 1931 as an independent security organization under the SS, working from a single apartment and reporting directly to Heinrich Himmler.Himmler enlisted Reinhard Heydrich, a former naval officer, to manage the small agency.The office underwent a name change to Sicherheitsdienst ( SD) in the summer of 1932.After the Nazis took over Germany, the SD gained more power while the SS infiltrated every top position in the Reich\'s security services.The SD had been a watchdog over the SS and Nazi Party members since before Hitler\'s rise to power and was instrumental in placing Himmler and Heydrich in charge of political police powers.The rise of SD and SS power was triggered by Hitler\'s appointment as Chancellor, which was quickly followed by his efforts to manipulate the aging president.On 28 February 1933, Hitler convinced Hindenburg to declare a state of emergency in Germany, which suspended civil liberties nationwide, partly due to the Reichstag fire the previous night. He claimed that he was working to stabilize the political scene in German politics by taking measures against Communist-related violent actions that threatened the state\'s stability.Himmler wasted no time and instead, the SD initiated the creation of a comprehensive list of Nazi\'s political opponents by creating an extensive card index. They also apprehended labor organizers, socialists in arrest, Jewish leaders, journalists, and communists before sending them to their new prison near Dachau outside Munich.Both Himmler\'s SS and SD had an impact on the regime, as they were instrumental in getting rid of both its political adversaries and perceived foes.Heydrich and Himmler were left with a vague mission by the SD, which made it possible for them to be held at all times.One of those scenarios would soon come into existence.During this time, the SS and the Sturmabteilung ( SA) were in a fierce competition for influence within the Third Reich.Despite his previous membership, Himmler had doubts about the SA\'s authority and was critical of the "rabble-rousing" brownshirts and what they perceived as indecent sexual behavior under its leadership.Himmler\'s SS and Heydrich\'S would have gained more influence to protect Hitler by using subversive tactics in order to prevent a plot from Ernst Roehm\' S.Hermann Göring transferred the Gestapo\'s control to Himmler on 20 April 1934.The SD was under the leadership of Heydrich, who had been named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934.The Reich\'s security mechanism was further enlarged by these events, which also provided Himmler with more surveillance power through the simultaneous infiltration of German police agencies by both parties.The SD became the exclusive provider of Party information services on June 9, 1934.']], [[363, 'in the sudanese wars, which british general won the battle of omdurman?', "Muhammad Ahmad's army, led by British General Sir Herbert Kitchener, defeated Abdullah al-Taashi during the Battle of Omdurman on September 2, 1898.In 1884, General Gordon's death prompted Kitchener to seek revenge.By utilizing modern rifles, machine guns, and artillery, a highly disciplined army proved to be superior to the British forces in their efforts to recapture the Sudan, which was twice their size.The Battle of Umm Diwaykarat in 1899 marked the end of the Mahdist forces, which were defeated.The central Sudanese suburb of Omdurman has a population of 1,500.A sum of 5 million.The Mahdi, Muhammad Ahmad, selected the village of Omdurman as his operational base in 1884.Khalifa's successor Abdullah chose to remain in charge of Khartoum after his death in 1885, following the successful siege.Kerreri, situated 11 km north of Omdurman, is where the battle took place.A combined force of Sudanese and Egyptian troops and 8,000 British regulars were under Kitchener's leadership.The commander positioned his troops in an arc around the town of Egeiga, near the Nile's shoreline, where twelve gunboats were waiting, facing a vast flat area with hills on either side.The British and Egyptian cavalry were stationed on both sides.The Ansar followers of Abdullah, who were sometimes called Dervishes, comprised around 50,000 individuals, with roughly 3,000 of them being cavalry.The group was divided into five groups, with Osman Azrak leading them in a shallow arc that ran for one mile along with the British.Kitchener's force was initially kept at bay while a low ridge, which spans 6 km and opens up into the plain, confronted the Mahdist forces.The Surgham Hills were the location where Abdullah al-Taashi and 17,000 soldiers were hidden by Osman Azrak's troops, while 20,000 more were stationed in the north-west, near the Kerreri hills.The slope on the right flank of Azrak witnessed a gathering of approximately 8,000 soldiers for their final force.The conflict commenced in the early hours of 6:00 a.m.m.Following the previous day's clashes, Osman Azrak and his group of 8,000 soldiers advanced towards the British who were waiting. They were soon joined by approximately 4,000 individuals in the northwest, who used both rifles and spears.At a height of approximately 2750 m, the British artillery fired 52 quick firing guns, causing significant losses to the Mahdist troops before they could engage with the Maxim guns and volley fire.The offensive in the front left the battle immobilized, resulting in roughly 4,000 Mahdist casualties.The attackers did not come within 50 m of the British trenches.The Ansar-controlled right flank was halted, and there were violent confrontations on the other side that caused the Mahdist troops to disperse.Kitchener was eager to take control of Omdurman before the Mahdist remnants could retreat.He advanced his troops towards the city, assembling them into distinct units to launch an attack.To clear the plain to Omdurman, the 21st Lancers, a British light cavalry regiment, were sent.They encountered a challenging situation.While a depression concealed 2,500 infantry, the 400-strong regiment attacked what they believed to be only dozens of dervishes.Following a fierce battle, the Lancers forced them to retreat, leading to three Victoria Crosses being awarded to Lancerons for their role in saving injured colleagues.Lieutenant Winston Churchill was among the participants in this battle.The Khalifa was able to restructure his forces thanks to the British advance on a larger scale.He directed his primary reserve to launch an attack from the west while ordering the forces to attack the Kerreri Hills from northwest at the same time, with over 30,000 soldiers in the field.By moving left in the echelon, Kitchener's troops advanced up Surgham ridge and southward.Hector MacDonald led a group of 3,000 Sudanese soldiers who were reinforced with Maxims

arc.To learn about the Cascade Range, refer to it.Across western North America, the Cascade Arc is made up of several volcanoes that extend over 700 miles in a volcanic belt from southwestern British Columbia to Northern California.Subduction along the Cascadia subduction zone has resulted in the formation of the arc.Despite its Cascade Range origin, the term is a geological subdivision that extends into the Coast Mountains beyond the Fraser River.Over 10,000,000 individuals reside in the region, which comprises some of the major cities along the arc, including Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver.The arc may be impacted by volcanic activity and potential earthquakes in the subduction zone.Due to the rapid growth of the Pacific Northwest population, the Cascade volcanoes are a hazardous area due to their history of eruptions and the vulnerability of future eruption sites. They are also protected by weak, hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks that can cause failure.Due to the danger it poses to Seattle and Tacoma, Mount Rainier is considered worthy of special attention as one of the Decade Volcanoes by IAVCEI.Cascade volcanoes have caused extensive, long-lived landslides that have inundated valleys far from their origins, and some of the inundered regions now sustain substantial populations.The Pacific Ocean is surrounded by the Cascade Volcanoes, which are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, a network of volcanoe and associated mountains.Several eruptions have been recorded in the history of the Cascade Volcanoes.Lassen Peak and a significant eruption of Mount St. were the two most recent events.Helens was present in 1980.The Mount Meager volcanic complex was where Canada's most recent significant eruption took place approximately 2,350 years ago.The Cascade Arc is composed of over 4,000 volcanic vents, which include almost 20 major volcanoes and some rarer volcanic forms like tuyas.The arc's volcanic activity started about 37 million years ago;Despite this, the majority of Cascade volcanoes in the present day are less than 2,000,000 years old, and the highest elevations are under 100,000 years.Twelve volcanoes in the arc have an elevation of over 10000 ft, with Mount Rainier and Mount Shasta being the highest, both exceeding 14000 feet.Medicine Lake and Newberry Volcano are the two most extensive Cascade volcanoes in terms of volume, with a combined total of approximately 145 and 108 cumi respectively.Only two Cascade volcanoes, Mount Garibaldi and Glacier Peak, are made entirely of dacite.Over the past 37 million years, the Cascade Arc has been responsible for the eruptions of a series of volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest.A number of volcanoes in the arc are frequently active.The Cascade Arc's volcanoes exhibit similar traits, but each one is unique in its geological history and evolution.The arc's southernmost volcano is Lassen Peak in California, which erupted in 1917, while Mount Meager in British Columbia, believed to have erupted around 2,350 years ago, is generally considered the northernmost member.The Cascadia subduction may have resulted in the formation of certain volcanoes, including the Silverthrone Caldera, which is located to the northwest of Mount Meager and is characterized by igneous rocks and basaltic and dacite.The Cascade Volcanic Arc includes volcanoes that have a connection to subduction, but the current estimates of plate configuration and subducting rate are in question.The Cascade Volcanic Arc seems to have split into segments;The northern end of the arc is less active than the central region, which is also the most active."]], [[366, 'stinking

wielded the magical sword 'hrunting'?", 'Unferth bestowed a sword upon Beowulf in the ancient Old English epic poem Beochulfat, which was called "Hrunting."Beowulf employed it in his fight against Grendel\'s Mother.The story of how Beowulf was given the sword in lines 1455-1458, and Unferth lent him an ancient sword called Hrunting that was extremely rare.The iron blade, exhibiting unpleasant patterns, had been softened by blood.Those who had fought and faced the worst danger in battle had never been able to take it down.It had been summoned to execute heroic actions before.The sword, which was said to have never failed anyone who used it, proved ineffective when Beowulf went down to the bottom of the lake to confront Grendel\'s mother.The failure of the heirloom\'s  fabulous powers forced Beowulf to discard it.In the Anglo-Saxon culture of war, which is the source of Beowulf, swords hold significant value.As a result, the exchange of weapons of war is given significant importance.Weapons like swords were distributed throughout Anglo-Saxon society, whether it was inherited from family members, created by monsters, discovered under magic rocks, or as offerings between lords and their subjects.There were instances where warriors engaged in such a discussion.A weapon was given as a gift in the Hrunting exchange.Unferth grants Beowulf his sword, acknowledging the loss of his glory and his submission to a greater warrior.Unferth, the former owner of the castle, may be reflected in how Hrunting defeats Beowulf in his conflict with Grendel\'s mother, as he was unable to overcome the highly reviled Grenger.After Grendel is defeated by Beowulf, the Danish king Hrothgar presents him with various weapons and other gifts.The significance of weaponry in a society is further highlighted.Beowulf transfers his rewards to Hygelac, signifying his commitment to his king.Hrunting\'s multiple connotations indicate that weapons of war can carry both positive and negative implications.Much of the poem is symbolic, as it depicts Hrunting Unferth giving birth to Beowulf and his mother Grendel\'s sword unexpectedly falling short.Due to Unferth\'s apparent disdain for Beowulf in the beginning of the story, his decision to bestow upon him Hrunting (or thrusting) can be seen as a gesture of peace and acceptance.By granting the sword, Unferth\'s recognition of Beowulf as a capable and formidable fighter is suggested by this observation.In contrast, the poem portrays Unferth as a cunning and treacherous individual.Furthermore, scholars suggest that Hrunting is the very sword that Unferth used to murder his own family members.The year 1943 saw the marriage of Ellen Ettlinger.The book Beowulf, Unferth and Hurting: An Interpretation in Man Vol.Jan. 43:.– Feb.A volume from 1943, pp.The score was 11–17.The date of March 30, 2009.p.When confronted with Grendel\'s mother, Unferth may have given up his sword to avoid going to war.Unferth\'s treachery manifests in his abandonment of his role as a Heorot warrior, as evidenced by the transfer of Hrunting from his hand to Beowulf.Unferth\'s sudden act of kindness towards Beowulf seems to be driven by noble motives, at first glance.Unferth\'s knowledge of the sword and its lack of effectiveness in combat suggests that he is more inclined towards cowardice than nobleness, which is further supported by the similarly unequivocal role played by his counterpart in Grettis Saga.Hrunting\'s inadequacy against Grendel\' mother has sparked extensive scholarly debate.J.L.']], [[369, 'which town on the river

Hedingham, Halstead and Earls Colne before finally reaching Colchester.The Colne Valley is home to a flood plain that spans about 300 metres, until it reaches its destination in Colchester.This area is utilized for pasture as the river has no safeguards against rising too high, despite being split into two pasture zones in Spring Lane, Old Lexden.A concrete-lined area that was once a canoeing facility, used as an open-air bathing spot until the 1970s, is where the river flows south of Colchester North Station.At the base of North Hill, the stream then meanders beneath a road bridge before finally falling through an underground weir at Middlemill where the now-demolished mill was built to manage discharge.The boundary between Castle Park and the cricket ground in Colchester is marked by a footbridge that connects it to the north side of the flood plain, which may be affected by flooding if the river rises too high.A small lake is encircled by the river, which then turns south-east and finally south before crossing a large weir and becoming tidal.After Colchester, the river flows through dense mud at low tides and then flows downstream to Brightlingsea, passing through Hythe, Rowhedge, and Wivenhoe villages.The Colne is denoted by navigation buoys located downstream from the barrier.The Colne banks are frequently adorned with pillboxes from the Second World War, particularly in close proximity to easily accessible crossings.The Colne is roughly followed by National Cycle Network Route 51, which runs from Castle Park to Wivenhoe Railway Station.The area

Additionally, there are 39 near-Earth objects, including 14 Mars-crossers.Additionally, there are 84 natural satellites of trans-Neptunian objects that have been identified.Despite the discovery of approximately 150 other small objects in its rings, only a handful were tracked enough to form orbits.It is likely that there are satellites orbiting other stars, and although many candidates have been discovered, none has been confirmed yet.Mercury and Venus, the inner planets, lack natural satellites.The Moon is the sole large satellite orbiting Earth;Mars boasts of two diminutive natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos.The giant planets possess extensive natural satellite systems, including six smaller moons like Galileo, Neptune, and Triton.There are six mid-sized natural satellites on Saturn that are sufficiently large to reach hydrostatic equilibrium, and Uranus has five.It has been suggested that certain satellites may contain living organisms.The Earth-Moon system stands out as the only one in the Solar System with a higher mass ratio of the Moon than the Earth, surpassing all other natural-satellite–planet ratios.Ceres is one of the known dwarf planets, but it has no known natural satellites.Charon, a relatively large and sizable natural satellite, is one of the four smaller ones orbiting Pluto;Hydra, Styx, Nix and Kerberos.Haumea has two natural satellites, while Eris and Makemake have a single one.The center of mass is located in the open space between Pluto and Charon, which is a unique feature of some double-planet systems.Natural satellites in relatively close orbits are thought to have originated from the same region of the protoplanetary disk that collided, resulting in their protruding circular orbital formation.It is believed that asteroids may have been captured and possibly fragmented further by collisions, leading to the identification of irregular satellites orbiting in distant, inclined, eccentric, and/or retrograde orbits.The majority of the Solar System's primary natural satellites have cyclical orbits, while their primary smaller counterparts do not.Exceptions to the typical large bodies include the Moon and potentially Charon, which are believed to have originated from the collision of two massive proto-planetary objects, as suggested by scientists.One or more orbiting natural satellites are expected to be formed by the replenishment of material from the central body.It is believed that asteroid moons are commonly formed through this process, in contrast to bodies of planet-sized particles.Triton is another anomaly;The dwarf planet is believed to be captured due to its retrograde motion, despite being large and in close orbit.The primary bodies of the Solar System's regular moons are locked to their respective primaries due to tidal locking, with the same side facing its planet.The sole exception is Hyperion, Saturn's natural satellite, which rotates in a disordered manner due to the gravitational pull of Titan.The outer natural satellites of the giant planet are too distant to be locked in, unlike their closest counterparts.The orbital periods of Jupiter, Phoebe, and Nereid differ from each other, with some having a rotation period that can last up to ten hours and others lasting hundreds of days."]], [[371, 'in german mythology, what was the name of the siren sent to lure boatmen to their deaths on the rhine?', 'neck;

Tea-urns are frequently used in catering to serve tea or coffee, even though they are typically made of metal cylinders with practical applications.Whether placed outside, in gardens, as architectural ornaments on buildings, or kept inside, large sculpted vases are commonly referred to as urns.The use of funerary urns, also known as cinerary or burial ones, has been observed in many cultures.The remains of the deceased were cremated by the survivors and the ashes were placed in an urn after their funeral.In China, an early Jiahu site has yielded pottery urns dating back to around 7000 BC, along with 32 burial ashes found in Laoguantai, Shaanxi.Over 700 burial urns have been discovered in the Yangshao region, with over 50 types of shapes and sizes.While children were the primary use of burial urns, adults were also utilized on occasion.The Urnfield civilization ( circa.The culture of 1300 BC to 750 BC, which was a product of the late Bronze Age in central Europe, is named after its vast sites of urn burials.The discovery of a Bronze Age burial site in Norfolk, England was followed by Sir Thomas Browne's description of the antiquities.He enlarged his research to examine burial and funerary practices, both past and present, and published it as Hydriotaphia or Urn Burial in 1658.In ancient Greece, it was customary to burn the remains in a painted Greek vase.The lekythos, a vase-like structure, was utilized to store oil in funerary rituals.A columbarium, a collective tomb, was where the Romans placed the urns in ledges.Doves are commonly placed in niches within dovecotes.Early Anglo Saxon England and Pre-Columbian cultures frequently utilized cremation urns.In later European traditions, a king's heart and organs may be placed in one or more urns after his death, as was the case with King Otto of Bavaria in 1916, and then interred elsewhere to signify remembrance by the deceased.The modern funeral industry offers cremation urns of different quality, complexity, and cost, which could potentially harm traditional burial traditions.Biodegradable urns are sometimes used for burial of both humans and animals.Paper, salt, cellulose, and other natural materials are utilized in their production, which can decompose into organic matter and serve as a seed for the growth of flora.In addition to the standard funeral or cremation ashes urns, it is feasible to keep a portion of the departed person's ash in valuable jewelry or small utensils.The ashes of two people may be placed in what are called companion urns.http: //artisurn.The urns used for cremation or funeral purposes can be made from a range of materials, including wood, stone, ceramic, glass, or steel.The practice of scattering ashes has become widespread in recent times.The outcome was the creation of urns that would disperse cremated remains.A few of them are eco-conscious, cost-effective, and can be repurposed after being utilized.A vase or larger container with a figure-like shape, such as figural urns, is created by using either the classic amphora or crucible style as the base.These can either be attached to the main body as handles or embellishments, or displayed in

Long John Silver who serves as the main antagonist.The most colorful and intricate character in the book, he remains prominently displayed in popular culture.Long John Silver, the quartermaster of Treasure Island under the infamous Captain Flint, is known for his cunning and opportunistic nature as a pirate.Long John Silver had a pet parrot named Captain Flint, who would often sit on his shoulder to nibble seeds.Silver maintains that he served in the Royal Navy and suffered a leg injury from Hawke, who is considered immortal.A crutch was placed under his left shoulder, and he managed to use it with great skill by jumping around like an acorn.With a face as big as the face of an old man, he was tall and strong, yet also intelligent and full of smiles.Flint\'s only feared individual was him, as he asserts.The character of Stevenson, like many of his other characters, exhibits a significant amount of duality;Silver is portrayed as a diligent and appealing seamstress, but his malevolent character becomes more apparent as the story progresses.His association with Jim Hawkins, the narrator and mentor of the novel, is both intriguing and emotional-filled, especially when it is revealed that he is the one who initiated the rebellion and later has to confront and fight him.Despite his willingness to change sides for personal gain, Silver has compensating qualities such as being wise with money management and physically courageous despite his disability.Flint, who has only a young son named Jim to support him, bravely defends himself against five mature men after discovering his cache is empty.At the end of the novel, Silver carries three or four hundred guineas worth of treasure with him, becoming one of only two former members of Captain Flint\'s crew to obtain a portion of what was recovered.It appears that a different quantity of bar silver is present on the island.In nineteen days, Ben Gunn, a repentant marooned man, spends all the £1,000.Jim\'s ambivalence towards Silver is evident in the last chapter, where he speculates that the old pirate must have found peace in retirement. It\'ll be a good thing, since the possibility of finding solace in another world is slim.Stevenson\'s depiction of Silver has had a significant impact on the contemporary representation of pirate icons.Silver\'s parrot, Captain Flint, who is a mocking name for his former leader, usually sits on his shoulder and can be heard discussing pirates or maritime words such as "Pioneer in Pieces" and "Stand Alone."To earn Jim\'s trust, Silver uses the parrot to tell exciting stories about the buccaneer\' storied past, often false.If anyone can spot more evil than the devil, it is likely that they will be killed.Cap\'n England, the pirate, was among the sailors she sailed with.She has explored Madagascar, Malabar, Surinam, Providence, and Portobello.The.The.She was present at the Viceroy of the Indies\' boarding station out of Goa, and her appearance would make you think she was a baby.Silver is married to a woman of African heritage, whom he relies on to manage his business affairs in his absence and liquidate his Bristol assets when it becomes impossible for him to return home.He informs his fellow pirates that he and his wife will meet up once the voyage to Skeleton Island is finished and Flint\'s treasure is found, after which Silver will retire to a luxurious lifestyle.']], [[374, 'which german-born chemist split the uranium atom in 1939 and won the nobel prize in 1944?', "The chemical element uranium is represented by the symbol U and has an atomic number of 92.The metal in the actinide series of the periodic table has a silvery-white appearance.The number of protons and electrons in a uranium atom is 92, with 6 of them being valence electron.Uranium's radioactivity is weak due to the instability of all its isotopes, with half-lives ranging from 69 years to 4.For a period of 5 billion years.Uranium-238 and uranium-235 are the two most prevalent isotopes in natural atoms, with 146 neutrons and accounting for over 99 percent of its nucleolar mass.Only plutonium has a higher atomic weight than uranium when it comes to primordially occurring elements.The density of this element is roughly 70% greater than that of lead, and marginally less than gold or tungsten.In soil, rock, and water, it is naturally present in small amounts of a few parts per million. It is obtained commercially from minerals that contain uranium, such as uraninite.Uranium is naturally found as uranium-238 (99.Between 2739 and 99,Uranium-235 has a concentration of 2752 % (0.1).The number 71980-0 is not inclusive.The concentration of uranium-234 ( 0.02) is significantly higher than the 7202 %.The score is 0 without any significant changes.The percentage is 0059.Uranium's gradual decay is accompanied by the emission of an alpha particle.The half-life of uranium-238 is roughly 4 hours.The age of the Earth can be dated to 47 billion years and 704 million years for uranium-235.The unique nuclear properties of uranium are utilized in numerous modern applications.The only naturally occurring fissile isotope is Uranium-235.Fast neutrons can cause uranium-238 to undergo fission and it is also fertile, meaning it can be transmuted in a nuclear reactor to become plutonium-235.Natural thorium can be used to produce uranium-233, which is another important fissile isotope in nuclear technology.The likelihood of spontaneous or induced fission with fast neutrons is low for Uranium-238;Both uranium-235 and uranyl 233 exhibit significantly higher fission cross-sectional strength in slow neutrons.A sustained nuclear chain reaction can be maintained by these isotopes when they are present in sufficient concentration.The heat in nuclear power reactors is generated by this, which also yields the fissile material required for nuclear weapons.Depleted uranium in 238U is employed in the production of armor plating and kinetic energy penetrators.The use of uranium as a colorant in tempered glass results in the creation of lemon yellow to green hues.Ultraviolet radiation causes uranium glass to turn green.Tinting and shading were also common uses for it in early photography.Martin Heinrich Klaproth is credited with discovering uranium in mineral pitchblende in 1789 and giving it the name Uranus.In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered the metal's radioactive properties, and Eugène-Melchior Péligot was the first to isolate it.J., Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi, and others have conducted research.Robert Oppenheimer began using it as a fuel in the nuclear power industry in 1934 and later introduced it in Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in war.The Cold War led to a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, which resulted in the creation of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that utilized uranium metal and plutonium-239 derived from uranyl.The ongoing concern for public health and safety is the security of the weapons and their fissile material after the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991.Watch the spread of nuclear weapons.When subjected to refinement, uranium becomes a weakly radioactive and silvery metal.With a Mohs hardness of 6, it can scratch glass and is approximately the same as titanium, rhodium, manganese, and niobium.The material is pliable, flexible, slightly paramagnetized, strongly electropositive, and has poor conductivity.The density of uranium metal is exceptionally high at 19.The density of 1 g/cm3 is greater than that of lead, which is 11.Tungsten and gold have a higher density than the latter, which is slightly less than 3 g/cm3.The speed limit is 3 grams per cubic foot.The reactivity of uranium metal increases with temperature, and it reacts with almost all non-metal elements and their compounds except for noble gases.The dissolution of uranium is caused by hydrochloric and nitric acids, while non-oxidizing acids only take a small amount of time to damage the element.When it is finely divided, it can react with cold water;Uranium metal is coated with a dark layer of its own oxide when it is airborne.The chemical extraction of uranium from ores results in its conversion into other chemical forms that can be utilized in industry.The discovery of fissility in an isotope was first made with Uranium-235."]], [[375, 'what was the name of the

sought advice from spiritualist mediums and fortune tellers, while Donald incorporated his trust in Mr Whoppit as a lucky mascot.Unless accompanied by Whoppit, he refused to drive.Tonia, his wife, was responsible for escorting Whoppit as soon as she entered the cockpit.In 2003, Frank Bennett, the reporter, mentioned Whoppit as one of the "threesome" that arrived for the 1964 record run, with Campbell and his wife among them.According to Bennett, the mascot was present in the cockpit every time, along with other mementos.In 1960, Whoppit was driving the Proteus Bluebird when Campbell collided with him in a serious accident while trying to break he land-speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats.In 1967, Campbell was fatally shot while flying the Bluebird K7, a jet hydroplane, during an attempted record attempt on Coniston.Mr Whoppit\'s body was not found, but he managed to escape and was located by Leo Villa almost immediately.The year 2001 saw the discovery and retrieval of Campbell\'s body.Campbell gave one of his dogs the name \'Whoppit.\'Whoppit\'s teddy bear mascot, Mrs Whacko, was not the one on the team and stayed with Tonia and the pit crew.The cartoon strip \'The story of Woppit\', which depicts a toy teddy bear, was first introduced as Mr Whoppits in the 1953 edition of Robin comics.A red felt jacket and a 9-inch Woppit bear that was manufactured by Merrythought in 1956 was gifted to Donald by his friend and manager Peter Barker.After joining the Bluebird team, Woppit purchased a patch of their "Bluebird" on his jacket and later donned eponymous flight suits.A slight modification was made to his name to \'Mr Whoppit\'.Robin 1959 depicts Campbell and Mr Whoppit in a photo.In the late 1990s, Merrythought re-released a limited edition of 5,000 copies of Mr Whoppit, featuring the Bluebird motif on the original red jacket.Whoppit was adopted as a mascot by Gina Campbell, the daughter of Donald Campbell who also helped her break water records in later years.Whoppit\'s third high-speed crash was a consequence of these factors.She put him up for auction along with other Campbell memorabilia in 1995.Despite being set to sell for approximately £60,000, he was unable to meet the reserve and remained in her possession.The auction of Mr Whoppit caused a backlash among Gina Campbell and Tonia Bern-Campbell, who were both emotional during the recovery process for Bluebird in 2001.']], [[376, 'which geological period is named after an ancient tribe which once inhabited south wales?', 'The Dean of Westminster was William Buckland DD FRS, an English theologian who lived from 12 March 1784 to 14 August 1856.During his time as both geologist and palaeontologist, he wrote the first complete report on a fossil dinosaur named Megalosaurus.The Copley Medal was bestowed upon him for his contribution in demonstrating how scientific analysis can reconstruct past events, particularly the discovery that Kirkdale Cave was a habitat for prehistoric hyenas.The use of fossilized faeces, which were later named coprolites, was pioneered by him in the reconstruction of ancient ecosystems.Buckland supported the Gap Theory, which posited that the Bible\'s Genesis refers to two separate stages of creation, separated by a significant amount of time;The late 18th and early 19th centuries saw the emergence of it as a means of reconciling the scriptural narrative with geological discoveries that suggested the earth was ancient.He initially believed that geological evidence had been found to support the biblical flood, but later came to believe that Louis Agassiz\'s theory of glaciation offered a more convincing explanation, and he played  an important part in promoting this theory in Great Britain.Buckland was born in 1911 at Axminster in DevonChisholm and later attended university. He grew up with his father, who was the Rector of Templeton and Trusham, and continued to collect fossil shells, including ammonites, from the Jurassic limestone rocks found in local quarries during his early years.He received his education from Blundell\'s School in Tiverton, Devon, and later from Winchester College. He then gained a scholarship to study for the ministry at Corpus Christi College in Oxford after attending John Kidd\' lecture series on mineralogy and chemistry, as well as exploring geology and conducting field research on strata during vacations.In 1804, he completed his BA, and later obtained an MA degree in 1808.After being elected a Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1809, he was later ordained as sarani and traveled on horseback to various locations in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales.He was appointed as a reader in mineralogy in 1813, succeeding John Kidd, and presented energetic and popular lectures that emphasized geology and palaeontology.He accumulated collections while serving as the unofficial curator of the Ashmolean Museum, traveling across Europe and meeting scientists such as Georges Cuvier.Buckland\'s rejection of Kirkdale Cave and flood geology in 1818 led to his election as a fellow of the Royal Society.He convinced the Prince Regent to grant another Readership in Geology that year, making him the first recipient of the new designation and delivering his inaugural speech on May 15, 1819.In 1820, Vindici Geologi was published as a book.Both the Confusion of Geology with Religion and the defense of the new science of geology are able to reconcile geological evidence with the biblical accounts of creation and Noah\'s Flood.As uniformitarianism was becoming more prevalent among others, Buckland proposed a new theory that the word "beginning" in Genesis denoted an unspecified period between the earth\'s creation and its current inhabitants, characterized by countless extinctions and the subsequent development of new species.Consequently, his theory of catastrophism included a version of Old Earth creationist or Gap creationistische.While predicting the deluge that occurred during Noah\'s time, Buckland was not in favor of flood geology, arguing that only small portions of the strata could have been created during the year the storm passed.He came to the conclusion that Kirkdale Cave in Yorkshire was inhabited by hyaenas during antediluvian times, and that the fossils found were not the remains of animals that perished in the Flood but were brought back from the tropics by surging waters, as he and others had initially believed.']], [[377, 'which chemical element, atomic number 74, used to be called wolfram?', 'The number 74, which is seventy-four in total, comes after 73 and before 75.The mathematical units of 74 include the twenty-first semiprime and the eleventh semipremium in the form of 2q.The sixth number in the 43-aliquot tree is represented by a composite.Within the aliquot sequence (74,40,43,1,0), the value of 74 is 40.* is a base of 6 ( 2026) and 36 ( 2236).Non-compulsory.Non-Hamiltonian polyhedra, which have a minimum number of vertices, total 74.Astronomy recognizes the M74 Messier object, which is a 10-atomic number of tungsten in science.There are five spiral galaxies that make up the Pisces constellation.http: //www.

the northeast;To the south-east lies New Zealand.For approximately 50,000 years, indigenous Australians spoke various languages and formed around 250 language groups before the first British settlement in Australia in the late 18th century.The discovery of Australia\'s eastern half by Dutch explorers in 1606 led to its claim by Great Britain in 1770, and it initially settled the area through penal transportation to New South Wales.The population grew steadily over the next few decades;The continent was explored and five more self-governing crown colonies were established.On 1 January 1901, the six colonies merged to create the Commonwealth of Australia.The political system in Australia that operates as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy with six states and several territories has remained stable since the end of the federation.The eastern states and coast have a concentrated urban population of 24 million.With the world\'s 12th-largest economy, Australia is one of the wealthiest and most developed nations globally.The per capita income of Australia was the fifth highest in the world in 2014.The 13th highest military spending among all

Federation (ANZUS), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and Pacific Islands Forum.The name Australia, as it is known in Australian English, comes from the Latin Terra Australis, which means southern land, and has been used to refer to speculative areas in the southern hemisphere since ancient times.In 1625, Samuel Purchas published a copy of the original Spanish translation of "Australia" in Hakluytus Posthumus, which was based on the Latin word "A note of Australia del Espritu Santo," and it is believed to be the earliest known use.The newly discovered lands in southern Indonesia were denoted by the Dutch adjectival form Australische in a Dutch book that was published in Batavia (Johor) in 1638.The initial official use of the name Australia was in a letter to Lord Bathurst on April 4, 1817, acknowledging Governor Lachlan Macquarie\'s receipt of Matthew Flinders\' charts of Australia.On 12 December 1817, Macquarie proposed to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted.The official name of Australia was agreed upon by the Admiralty in 1824.It is believed that human settlement on the Australian continent began approximately 42,000 to 48,000 years ago, possibly due to the migration of people from Southeast Asia via land bridges and short sea-crosses.The earliest inhabitants could have been the precursors of present-day Indigenous Australians.During the late 18th century, when European settlement occurred, Indigenous Australians were mostly hunter-gatherers who had a complex oral culture and spiritual values that relied on land reverence and reliance on the Dreamtime.Ethnic Melanesian Torres Strait Islanders were originally horticulturists and hunter-gatherers.Fishermen from Maritime Southeast Asia made occasional trips to the northern coasts and waters of Australia.Willem Janszoon, a Dutch navigator, is responsible for the first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland and the initial recorded landfall on the continent.At the start of 1606, he saw the coast of the Cape York Peninsula and made a landing on the Pennefather River near the

sequel, AdventureSofHuckleberry Finn (1885), are among his literary works, with the latter being dubbed  The Great American Novel.Twain\'s upbringing took place in Hannibal, Missouri, which would later become the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.Following his printer apprenticeship, Twain worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to the newspaper of his older brother, Orion Clemens.Afterward, at the Mississippi River, he became a riverboat pilot before departing to join Orion in Nevada.He humorously remarked that he had not succeeded in mining and instead chose to work for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise in journalism.A humorous tale based on a former miner\'s experience at Angels Hotel in Angel Camp, California, was the inspiration for the publication of his story, titled "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County" in 1865.The short story gained worldwide recognition and was even translated into classic Greek.He was lauded by both critics and peers for his cleverness and satire in prose and speech, and became friends with presidents, artists, industrialists like myself, as well as European royalty.Twain\'s writings and lectures generated substantial income, but his investments in ventures that failed due to their complexity and imprecision caused the mechanical typesetter, known as the Paige Composer, to lose a significant amount of money.After experiencing financial difficulties, he sought bankruptcy protection from his creditors and eventually overcame the situation with the help of Henry Huttleston Rogers.Twain resolved to pay all of his pre-bankruptcy creditors in full, even though he had no legal obligation to do so.Twain was born shortly after the Comet of Halley visited him and he anticipated going out with it.The day after the comet\'s return, he passed away.The greatest American humorist of his time, Twain, was praised by William Faulkner for being the father of American literature.Early life: Samuel Langhorne

continuity of this practice is a challenging task, given the absence of evidence on the specific motives for its official adoption in the early years of 1822.Greek historians have suggested that the current flag was based on an older version of the Cretan Kallergis family\'s flag, which is almost identical to one from the same family.The flag was modeled after their coat of arms, which is believed to have been inspired by the standards of their supposed predecessor, the Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus II Phocas.Unconfirmed descriptions of the pattern suggest that it comprised nine stripes alternated between blue and white, along with a cross placed on the upper left N.The Greek flag shares a striking similarity with the stripe-pattern used in other centuries-old flags, such as the British East India Company\'s pre-1707 flag or the Flag of Greece.It is challenging to establish or trace the origins of flags that are based on older designs.Antiquity and the Byzantine Empire Flags

The island boasts a rich maritime and industrial past that includes boat building, sail making, manufacturing of flying boats, testing and developing of Britain's space rockets.The Isle of Wight

from Southampton, Lymington, and Portsmouth.According to certain theories, Bouldnor was a bustling seaport during the Neolithic period, which allowed for trade with the Middle East due to the presence of wheat hundreds of years earlier.During the Bronze and Iron Age, Ptolemy was the first to mention the Isle of Wight in Geography.Tin was a crucial component in the smelting of bronze in Bronze Age Britain, as it was found in significant quantities in Cornwall and Devon.During that period, the sea level was much lower, and ships carrying tin were transported across the Solent for export, potentially on Ferriby Boats.The Bronze Age Collapse and trade disruptions in the Mediterranean around 1300 BC led metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze, as suggested by Anthony Snodgrass.Evidence suggests that the Durotriges, a Celtic tribe, resided on the Isle of Wight during Iron Age Britain and the Late Iron Period, as evidenced by their coins found in places like the South Wright Hoard and Shalfleet Hoar.The presence of a considerable amount of Continental immigration in South eastern Britain is evident in the genetic makeup of the current population.The Isle of Wight's economy may have been significantly impacted by the significant decline in tin prices during the start of the Iron Age.The trade however continued, as is evident from the remarkable local abundance of European Iron Age coins.In the Roman period, Caesar claimed ownership of the Isle of Wight from the Belgae in 85 BC and gave it the name Ictus (or Vectimis).The entire island was taken by the commander Vespasian, as noted by Suetonius, a historian from Rome.At least five Roman villas have been discovered on the island, with one located near Gurnard and submerged.The main items exported in the first century were hides, slaves and hunting dogs, as well as grain, cattle, silver, gold, and iron.The local economy may have been impacted by the production of Ferriby Boats and Blackfriars Ships.During the 6th Century, the island was transformed into the Jutish kingdom of Wihtwara.The first rulers of the kingdom were believed to be Wihtgar, who may have been a make-believe deity, and Stuf.Wulfhere of Mercia invaded the region in 661 and forced its conversion to Christianity.After his departure to Mercia, the islanders turned back to their pagan beliefs."]], [[386, 'what is the

culinary, medicinal, and spiritual.The term  herb is used in two ways, one being culinary and the other medicinal.The leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, resin, root bark, inner bark (and cambium), berries, and other parts of the plant can be classified as herbs for medicinal or spiritual purposes.The word  herb\'s pronunciation is UK-specific, but it is commonly used by individuals from North America and other regions where h-dropping occurs.The history of medicine dates back to 5000 BCE, when Sumerians used herbs.Fennel, coriander, and thyme were employed by the Ancient Egyptians in 1555 BCE.Galen, a physician in ancient Greece, was famous for creating intricate herbal remedies that contained as many as 100 ingredients in 162 CE.Culinary herbs are used in small quantities to enhance

beat level are referred to as division levels, while slower levels have multiple levels.Examine the Metric structure.Music has always been associated with the importance of music beats.Upbeat and downbeat are two different ways to describe the initial beat of the bar.e.The first item.The upbeat is the final beat in the previous bar, which immediately precedes and anticipates the downbeat.The direction a conductor moves in is indicated by both terms.An upbeat figure, section, or phrase is sometimes referred to as an anticipatory note or succession of notes preceding the first barline of a work.The terms  pickup\'\' and krousis\' (from Greek ana and French anabolet) are also used as alternative expressions.The second term was borrowed from poetry, where it denotes an initial line of

(downbeat) is the most powerful accent in the melody and the optimal place for changing chords, while the following three are the next strongest: on consecutive beats.The second and fourth are less strong, as they are not beat up.When a rhythm is frequently used, the subdivisions between pulse beats, such as eighth notes, can be even less powerful.By repeatedly counting to four and evenly, it is effortless to simulate the effect.A bass drum strike on the downbeat and a constant eighth note subdivision on one of the ride\'s notes are used as contrasting beats, with each being recorded separately.Popular western music incorporated this African polyrhythm technique as a fundamental element.According to Grove Music, the  Offbeat is an alternative or tied downbeat that replaces the previous bar\'s sound.The strongest beat in time can never be the downbeat.Off-pacific sounds are more prevalent in certain genres, such as rock\'n\'roll and Ska music.A \'backbeat\' or backbeat is an accentuation that occurs syncopated with the beat.These are played to a basic rhythm, specifically the beats 2 and 4.The Encyclopedia of Percussion explains that R&B\'s allure is due to its evocative

Sixers of the Big Bash League, the New South Wales Blues cricket team, and the Sydney Swans Australian Football League club are all located there.Owned and managed by the SCG Trust, it is also responsible for managing the Sydney Football Stadium that is located nearby.Prior to the establishment of the 44,000-seat Football Stadium in 1988, the Sydney Cricket Ground was the primary venue for rugby league in Sydney.Lachlan Macquarie, the Governor of New South Wales, created the second Sydney Common in 1811, which was approximately one-and-a-half miles wide and ran from South Head Rd to the present-day site of Randwick Racecourse.Situated on the southern edge of the city, this site is characterized by its combination of sandhill and swamp, and was once used as a garbage dump until the 1850s, but it was not considered an appropriate location for sports.The Sydney Common south of Victoria Barracks was given to the British Army in 1851, with plans for it to be used as a garden and cricket ground for their soldiers.The 11th North Devonshire Regiment was the first to use it, and they ruined and graded the southern part of the rifle range next to the Barracks.Over the next few years, the teams from Victoria Barracks merged into a more permanent organization known as the Garrison Club.The Garrison Ground was the name given to the ground when it was first opened in February 1854.Until 1856, Hyde Park was the primary location for sports and racing in the colony, but after its conversion to public gardens, city cricketers and footballers had to find alternative venues.In the late 1860s, public recreation was permitted in a section of the Sydney Common that stretched from the Garrison Ground to Dowling Street.Charles Moore, the Mayor of Sydney who planted several Moreton Bay Fig trees, gave his name to Moore Park. These trees still exist today.The first zoo in Sydney was established at Moore Park, which also served as a venue for rugby matches between Sydney University and the Wallaroofs.At that time, Sydney was a small and densely populated city that required frequent walking for navigation, with Moore Park situated on the outskirts.The distance from the city made it less appealing to cricketers.The East Sydney Cricket Club was chosen as the location for the Garrison Ground, which was later renamed the Civil and Military Ground by Lieutenant-Colonel John Richardson, who led the Sydney garrison.The departure of British troops from Victoria barracks in 1870 caused uncertainty about the future of the Civil and Military Ground.Following the closure of the Albert Ground in the 1870s, the NSWCA began using the Civil and Military Ground on a regular basis.The ground's refurbishment was initiated by the NSW Government in 1875.The NSWCA's former president, Richard Driver, overcame the challenges of Victoria Barracks and the other cricket clubs in assuming control to allow the administration of the ground.Governor Sir Hercules Robinson dedicated the ground in 1876.The NSWCA had a strong following.The City of Sydney Council's solicitor and prominent MP was Driver.Thomas Garrett, the Minister for Lands, also provided assistance;The colonial side was about to be invaded by his son.It is not surprising that Sir Hercules Robinson, the NSWCA's ground-management chief, appointed William W. as Driver within a few years.The grandstand, named after the first trustees, was created by Stephen and Phillip Sheridan.The NSWCA appointed one trustee, while the government appointed two others.The NSWCA and the Trust have a strong connection, as they collaborated to pool funds for the next six years.The military's connection with the ground was broken when John Richardson and the Sydney garrison engaged in combat in Sudan."]], [[396, "in november 2011, wigan rugby league player sam tomkins made his rugby union debut in a 'one-off' game playing for which team?", "Sam Tomkins, who was born on 23 March 1989, is a professional footballer from England who plays in the Super League for the Wigan Warriors.The England national team's fullback, who was previously a member of the New Zealand Warriors in the National Rugby League.He achieved two Super League Grand Finals victories with Wigan in 2010 and 2013, and also won two Challenge Cup finals in 2011 and 2013.He is the sibling of Logan and Joel Tomkins.Tomkins was born in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.After his family's move to the north in the early 1990s, he joined Chorley Panthers amateur club at the age of seven.Tomkins' family relocated to Wigan to further his career, where he played for Wighan St.Before being awarded a scholarship, Patrick was attracted by Wigan and signed he full-time contract in late 2007.In 2008, he made his Wigan debut in a Challenge Cup match against Whitehaven, becoming the first rugby league player to score five tries in an initial game.The year 2009 would be the turning point for Tomkins.Playing in his first league game against Harlequins RL, he managed to score 15 tries and made 27 appearances.Wigan's first choice stand-off was him, and he was included in the Super League Dream Team.

It is similar to ground billiards in Western Europe, where it originated from classical antiquity and sometimes involved striking objects such as arches, pegs, balls, and mallets, much like field hockey sticks.In the 12th century, a team ball game called "or" was played in France and southern Britain, with players sharing games like football or hockey.Cornwall has attested it as early as 1283.The origins of croquet, which became a sensation in England during the 1860s and later spread internationally, are explained by Nicky Smith in her book Queen of Games: The History of Croquet.It is believed that the game\'s ancestor was brought to Britain from France during the reign of Charles II of England in 1630-1685 and was named "Pall-mall," a name that has been linked to the Latin word for "ball and mallet," which is also present in the French game.The ninth edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica provided an explanation for this in 1877.In his 1810 book The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, Joseph Strutt detailed the game of pall-maille in England as a ball hit with ice. The winner is determined by the player who strikes the ball with the least amount or most powerful iron mallet.It should be noted that there are two arches located at either end of the alley.The game of mall was a popular pastime during Charles the Second\'s reign, and the Mall Walk in Saint James\' Park was named after its purpose of entertaining visitors who played it frequently.Despite the presence of pall-mall names and games with similar names in other countries like France and Italy, the description above implies that croquet-style games were prevalent in England by the early 1600s.In some of the early modern sources, a pall-mall game played over an extensive range is mentioned, but Strutt\'s 1801 book portrays billiard-style ground gameplay with balls on the field, bats, and peg.The image\'s caption identifies croquet games as an unusual ancient pastime, emphasizing that they were not new in England during the early 1800s.Samuel Johnson\'s 1755 dictionary defines a game called pall-mall, which is similar to modern croquet in that involves hitting the ball through an iron ring.There is no proof that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke, which is the defining trait of modern sport.The second hypothesis suggests that the principles behind the modern croquet game were introduced in Ireland during the 1850s, possibly by being transported from Brittany where a similar game was played on the beaches.']], [[398, "according to a short story by washington irving (1819), who escaped his nagging wife by wandering into new york's catskill mountains, fell asleep, and returned to his village, where he found that 20 years had passed?", 'In the southeast, the Catskill Mountains can be found and are commonly referred to as such due to their vast size.S.The state of New York.Located approximately 100 miles north-northwest of New York City and 40 miles southwest of Albany, they begin just west of the Hudson River.The Catskills are situated in five counties, including Delaware, Greene, Schoharie, Sullivan, and Ulster, with some of them falling within the limits of southwestern Albany, eastern Broome, northwestern Orange, undated Otsego counties.Foothills can be found in southeastern Chenango, southern Montgomery, northern Otsego, and western Schenectady counties.New York state law protects the Catskill Mountains, which are a cultural and geographic region that is typically defined as areas near or within the boundaries of the National Forest Park\'s 700,000-acre forest preserve.Geologically speaking, the Catskills are a mature dissected plateau that was once flat but has been elevated and eroded by watercourses into ridges.The Appalachian Plateau, which is the highest-elevation section of it, is characterized by the Catskill Mountains as its northeastern endpoint.The Catskill Mountains and the Adirondack Mountains are sometimes compared, but the latter are not geologically related as they form part of the Canadian Shield.In the same way, the Shawangunk Ridge, which is part of the Ridge-and-Valley province, is a continuation of Kittatinny Mountain in New Jersey and Blue Mountain (also present in Pennsylvania) and forms the southeastern edge of what is now the Catskills.The Allegheny Highlands forests ecoregion encompasses the Catskills in terms of climate.Both the Hudson River School and urban vacationers from New York City visiting the Catskills in the mid-20th century have made the region a well-known cultural hub in American culture.The abundance of large resorts in the area provided a chance for many young stand-up comedians to develop their skills.The Catskills have been a popular destination for artists, musicians, and writers, particularly in and around Phoenicia and Woodstock, New York.Nicolaes Visscher I\'s 1656 map of New Netherland revealed the location of the mouth of Catskill creek.High Lands of the Esopus is the name given to the southern region, which is a reference to one of several local bands of northern Lenape Native Americans that lived along the Hudson River and hunted in the highlands along this creek.Although the meaning of the name ( cat creek\'s) in Dutch and the names of early Dutch explorers are settled, the exact origin and reason for its name is unknown.The presence of mountain lions was known during the Dutch arrival in the 17th century.The most commonly accepted explanation for the name is that bobcats were seen near Catskill creek and the present-day village of Catsburg.Despite this, there is no evidence of bobcats being present in large numbers on the Hudson\'s banks, and the Catskill name was not recorded on paper until after 1655, which was over 40 years ago.The Dutch sailors\' description of the Indian stockades on the riverbank was corrupted.According to a Belgian authority, the term is present in many place names across Flanders and has no connection to cats, but rather to fortifications.It was named after Jacob Cats, a Dutch poet who was also recognized for his real estate abilities, and who made money from speculation in sea-reclaimed land.The Cat was a vessel that had already traversed the Hudson River before the name was introduced.A cat, as used in nautical slang during that time, could also denote an instrument or a particular type of small ship, known as the "catboat."It is believed that the Iroquois people play lacrosse, which was previously played by Dutch visitors.']], [[399, 'whose third symphony is also called his ‘organ symphony’?', "This article is centered on the genre of music.See the Symphony No. page for further details.The

of France, specifically in regions where the Saône, a tributary of the Rhône, flows through valleys and hills.Known as "Burgundies," the most well-known wines produced in this region are dry red wines made from Pinot noir and white wines with Chardonnay grapes.Gamay and Aligoté are two of the other grape varieties used to make red and white wines, respectively.The region produces a small amount of both rosé and sparkling wines.Although Chablis and Beaujolais, which are primarily Chardonnay and Gamay wines respectively, are part of the Burgundy wine region, they are typically given their own names.The number of AOCs in Burgundy is higher than any other region in France, and the region is often regarded as the most knowledgeable among French wine regions.The Burgundy AOCs are categorized based on the location of vineyards, which are clearly defined, as well as regional appellations that lack specific characteristics.The tradition of marking vineyards by their \'decorations\' in Burgundy has been around since medieval times, with the aid of several monasteries that contributed to the growth of the wine industry in the region.The geographical and climatic range of Burgundy extends from Auxerre to Mâcon in the north, or, if you\'re considering the Beaujolais area, to Lyon.Chardonnay grapes are the source of Chablis, a white wine produced in the Auxerre area.Chablis is situated near Irancy, a smaller appellation that produces red wines, while Saint-Bris creates white wines using Sauvignon blanc.Located 85 miles southeast of Chablis, the Côte d\'Or is home to all the Grand Cru vineyards in Burgundy, with the exception of one that produces the highest quality wine.Both the Côte d\'Or region and the Cresaceous area are split into two parts: the former from Dijon to Corgoloin and its second one from Ladoix up to Dezize-les-Maranges.The wine-growing region in the heart of Burgundy spans a length of only 40 km, with most areas measuring less than 2 km in width.The area is composed of small villages situated on the eastern side of a hilly terrain, encircled by sloping and flat vineyards that offer shelter from the wet weather and provide some rainfall.In this region, the Grand Cru vineyards are typically located in the middle and higher part of the slopes, which have the most favorable drainage and exposure to sunlight, while the Premier Cru wines come from slightly less exposed sloped areas.The flat area surrounding the villages is where the production of  Village\'s wines occurs, which are relatively common.The Côte de Beaune is the only Burgundy wine region that exclusively produces white Grand Cru wines, with Musigny Blanc being the exception and all other Burgundian wines are classified as red.The reason for this is attributed to the fact that different soils tend to favor Pinot noir and Chardonnay.In the Côte d\'Or region, red and white wines are produced alongside the more obscure appellations Mercurey, Rully, and Givry.The Mâconnais region, situated below the Côte Chalonnaise, is renowned for its production of affordable and easy-to-serve white wine.The Beaujolais region, which is known for its fruity red wines made from Gamay grapes, is located further south.The climate in Burgundy is continental and characterized by cold winters and hot summers.The weather during harvest can be unpredictable, with possible conditions including rain, hail, and snow.Due to the climate, Burgundy vintages exhibit significant differences.Although the Celts may have been growing vines in Burgundy before the Roman conquest of Gaul in 51 BC, archaeological evidence indicates that viticulture was still practiced in the region as early as the second century AD.The Greek traders, who had been involved in viticulture since the late Neolithic period, established Massala around 600 BC and engaged in extensive trade across the Rhône valley, which was also the site of the Romans\' arrival in the second century BC.']], [[401,

over 150 million copies sold.The title of the book is a reference to the protagonist Sauron, the Dark Lord, who had created the One Ring earlier in order to rule over the other Rings of Power as his ultimate weapon for conquering and ruling Middle-earth.The plot takes place in the Shire, a hobbit territory similar to the English countryside, and moves across Middle-earth following the War of the

to have been formed.A mere 5 billion years after Earth's existence.Several theories have been proposed to account for its origin.The most widely accepted theory suggests that the Moon was created by the debris left behind after a collision between Earth and Theia, despite only being around 10,000 years old.The Moon is in a phase of rotation with the Earth, and it always displays an identical face, with its adjacent side covered by dark volcanic maria that fill the gaps between the bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters.Measured by illuminance on Earth's surface, it is the second-bluest regularly visible object in the sky, after the Sun.Despite its bright white appearance, the surface is dark and has a reflectance that is slightly higher than that of worn asphalt.Since ancient times, the Moon has been a cultural influence on language, calendars, art, and mythology due to its prominent position in the sky and periodic lunar phases.Occupancy, body tides, and the slight extension of the day are all influenced by the Moon's gravitational pull.The Moon's apparent size in the sky is almost the same as Earth because of its current orbital distance, which is approximately thirty times larger than Earth, resulting in it covering the Sun precisely in total solar eclipses.The apparent visual size matching will not continue in the far-off future.At present, the Moon's distance from Earth is increasing at a rate that is not constant and may increase every year.In 1959, the Soviet Union's Luna program was the first time to reach the Moon using unmanned spacecraft;Until now, the United States' NASA Apollo program has only conducted one manned mission, which began with Apollo 8 in 1968 and was followed by six lunar landings between 1969 and 1972, including Apollo 11.The Moon's origin, internal structure, and history were studied through the recovery of more than 380 kg of lunar rocks from these missions.The Moon has only been visited by unmanned spacecraft since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.The natural satellite of Earth is commonly known as  the Moon' in English.Moone, which evolved from mone in 1135 and Old English mna before 725, is the root of the noun moon, just like all other Germanic language cognates.The name Luna is sometimes used, either in poetry as a personified Moon or in science fiction to distinguish it from other moons.The term moon in modern English is the primary adjective used to describe the Moon, which comes from the Latin word Luna.The adjective selenic, which is less common, was derived from the Ancient Greek term Selene (from which the prefix  selenography-like) comes from.Cynthia was a cross between the Greek goddess Selene and the Roman goddess Diana.Luna, Cynthia, and Selene are all recognizable names in the terminology of lunar orbits, including apolune, pericynthion, or selenocentric.Diana is linked to the term that signifies 'birth'.The Moon's formation has been proposed to take place through various mechanisms over the past 30-50 million years.According to Rick Carlson's latest research, the age range of 4 and 5 years old is slightly lower.A total of 40 plus 4.The time frame is 45

belt objects to investigate them.New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on January 19th, 2006, and departed into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of approximately 0.04 seconds.asteroid 132524 APL was briefly encountered by New Horizons, which then made its closest approach to Jupiter on February 28th, 2007, at a distance of.New Horizons' speed was boosted by the Jupiter flyby's gravity assist;The flyby facilitated a general evaluation of New Horizons' scientific capabilities, providing information on the planet's atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere.With the exception of short annual checks, the majority of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to maintain on-board systems.The Pluto encounter was retrieved on December 6, 2014, and New Horizons returned online.The New Horizons spacecraft started its approach phase to Pluto on January 15th, 2015.The first spacecraft to explore Pluto was launched on July 14th, 2015, at 11:49 UTC, and it flew 12500 km over the dwarf planet's surface.New Horizons has successfully flown past Pluto and is now preparing to fly over the Kuiper belt object, which is expected to arrive on January 1st, 2019 at 43 degrees.The distance from the Sun is 4 AU.The New Horizons team was formed by Stamatios  Tom Krimigis and Alan Stern in December 2000, with the former being the leader of the space division at the Applied Physics Laboratory, one of many participants in the New Frontiers Program competition.The personification of the Pluto mission was how Krimigis described Stern, who was appointed as the project's primary investigator.Stern's work had been the primary inspiration for New Horizons since Pluto 350, with most of the team from Pluto Kuiper Express utilizing it as their main source.The New Horizons proposal was among the five that were submitted to NASA.In June 2001, it was chosen as one of two finalists to undergo a three-month concept study.POSSE, a separate and comparable Pluto mission concept, was led by Larry W., the principal investigator of the University of Colorado Boulder, as another finalist.The JPL, Lockheed Martin, and University of California provided funding for Esposito.The APL had an edge, thanks to the assistance of Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University.The NEAR Shoemaker, which was recently developed for NASA, had already landed on the orbit orbital target of 433 Eros and achieved scientific and engineering marvels.New Horizons was officially selected for funding as part of the New Frontiers program in November 2001.Sean O'Keefe, the newly appointed NASA Administrator after the Bush Administration, was not in favor of New Horizons and instead excluded it from NASA's budget for 2003.Stern urged Science Mission Directorate Ed Weiler to provide funding for New Horizons, with the expectation that the mission would be included in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey;The United States National Research Council has compiled a wish list that prioritizes the scientific community's viewpoints.The Planetary Science Decadal Survey of 2003-2013 was released in the

allergic reaction that can be fatal is often accompanied by anaphylaxis.The usual side effects of this condition include an itchy rash, throat or tongue swelling, shortness of breath, vomiting, lightheadedness, and low blood pressure.The symptoms usually appear within minutes and can last for a few hours.Common triggers include insect bites and stings, food intake, and medication.Latex exposure and exercise are among the other causes.There may also be cases where there is no apparent reason.The release of mediators from white blood cells can occur through immunological or non-immunologic means.The presenting symptoms and signs are used to determine the diagnosis after exposure to a potential allergen.The initial treatment for anaphylaxis involves injecting epinephrine into a muscle, administering intravenous fluids, and positioning the patient on its back.It may be necessary to administer more epinephrine.Antihistamines and steroids are among the other measures that can be used in conjunction.Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis should carry an epinephrine autoinjector and be identified for the condition.In the global context, 0.It is estimated that anaphylaxis will impact around 05-2 percent of the population at some point in their lives.It seems like rates are on the rise.It is most frequently observed in young people and females.The number of individuals admitted to a hospital in the United States with anaphylaxis is approximately 0.A mere 3% survive.The word is derived from the, and the is present.Symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis can manifest in different ways over several minutes or hours, with an average onset of 5 to 30 minutes when intravenous exposure occurs and 2 hours if food is consumed.Most commonly affected areas are the skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal tract, heart and vasculature, and central nervous system, with two or more of these being involved.Generalized hives, itching, flushing, or swelling of the affected tissues are typical skin symptoms.Angioedema patients may exhibit a burning sensation on their skin, rather than an itchy condition.The swelling of the tongue or throat is observed in approximately 20% of cases.Other symptoms may include a runny nose and conjunctivitis.Oxygen deprivation can cause the skin to have a blue hue.Shortness of breath, wheezes, or stridor are among the possible respiratory symptoms and signs.Bronchial muscle spasms are responsible for most of the wheezing, while stridor is caused by upper airway blockage due to swelling.It is possible to suffer from hoarseness, swallowing pain, or coughing.Following myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, or cardiac arrest can result in spasm of the Cardiovascular Coronary artery.The risk of cardiac effects is higher in individuals with underlying coronary disease who experience anaphylaxis.The presence of histamine-releasing cells in the heart is linked to the coronary spasm.Low blood pressure is a more frequent cause of accelerated heart rate, but 12% of cases with low blood stress result in sluggish heart rates called Bezold–Jarisch reflex.The sensation of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness can be caused by a decrease in blood pressure or shock, whether it's distributive or cardiogenic.Very low blood pressure is the only indication of anaphylaxis.In addition to abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, Gastrointestinal symptoms can be present.Confusion and a loss of bladder control or pelvic pain similar to uterine cramps may occur.Blood vessel dilation around the brain can lead to headaches.Anger or a sense of impending doom has been described.Anaphylaxis can be provoked by almost any foreign substance.Insect bites or stings, food, and medication are all potential triggers.The most frequent triggers in children and young adults are food, while older adults experience more frequent exposure to medications and insect bites and stings.Physical factors, biological agents like semen and latex, hormonal changes, food additives like monosodium glutamate and food colors, and topical medications are among the less frequent causes.Exercise-induced anaphylaxis or temperature can trigger the activation of mast cells through physical factors."]], [[410, 'in what us state is mount rushmore?', "A sculpture called Mount Rushmore National Memorial is carved into the granite face of Mount Everest, a granite batholith formation located in the Black Hills near Keystone, South Dakota, United States.The Danish-American Gutzon Borglum and his son Lincoln Bumblemore created Mount

famous people in the Black Hills region of South Dakota to promote tourism.The Needles were the initial idea that Robinson had in mind;The Needles site was turned down by Gutzon Borglum because of the inferior granite and strong resistance from Native American tribes.They chose the Mount Rushmore site that is positioned in the southeast direction for optimal sun exposure.Robinson envisioned the sculpture to showcase western icons such as Lewis and Clark, Red Cloud, and Buffalo Bill Cody, but Borglum chose to focus on the four presidents who would be carved into the mountain.U.S. has secured federal funding thanks to the enthusiastic support of a prominent political patron of Mount Rushmore.S.Senator Peter Norbeck initiated the construction of the memorial in 1927, and it was completed between 1934 and 1939.The construction industry was taken over by Lincoln Borglum after the death of his father, Gutzon Borlum, in March 1941.The original plan was to depict all 50 presidents as a complete portrait, but due to insufficient funding, construction was discontinued by the end of October 1941.The United States has recognized Mount Rushmore as an iconic symbol, which has also been depicted in popular literature and fiction.More than two million people visit it annually.The Lakota Sioux renamed the mountain after Charles E, and it was initially known as  The Six Grandfathers''.In 1885, Rushmore, a distinguished lawyer in New York, was present during an expedition.The initial objective of carving at Rushmore was to boost tourism in the Black Hills region of South Dakota.Following extended talks between a Congressional delegation and President Calvin Coolidge, the project was approved by Congress.The carving was initiated in 1927 and lasted until 1941 without any fatalities.Black Elk, the Lakota leader, journeyed from the mountain to Harney Peak as part of their spiritual pilgrimage.The United States' claim to the area, which was subject to a series of military campaigns from 1876 to 1878, is still disputed by the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie.American colonists referred to the peak as Cougar Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain (known as Cottonwood Mountain in North Carolina), Slaughterhouse Mountain and Keystone Cliffs.During a prospecting trip, Charles Rushmore, David Swanzey (father of Carrie Ingalls), and Bill Challis named the place Mount Rushmor.The Keystone Area Historical Society is available at //www.Keystone Castle.You can find it at com/kahs/characters.HTML Keystone Characters.The document was retrieved on October 3rd, 2006.The idea for Mount Rushmore was conceived by historian Doane Robinson in 1923 to increase tourism in South Dakota.Robinson convinced sculptor Gutzon Borglum to journey to the Black Hills in 1924 to carry out the carving.While working on the Confederate Memorial Carving, Borglum had a conflict with the officials who oversaw it.The initial plan was to execute the carvings in granite pillars called the Needles.Borglum came to the realization that the eroded Needles were too thin to aid in sculpting.Mount Rushmore, which was more opulent, was chosen for its location that faced the southeast and had optimal sun exposure.After spotting Mount Rushmore, Borglum declared that America would move along the skyline.Congress granted approval for the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission on March 3,

by the Free Officers, a group of nationalist officers who served in the military of Egypt and Sudan.In 1945, the Muslim Brotherhood formed a covert group of junior officers known as "Namaste" (Gabadi), Khaled Mohieddin, and Salah Nar.After the war, Muhammad Naguib joined the Free Officers in 1949 and served as their official leader during the period leading up to the revolution. He gained hero status and had a significant impact on the army.The Great Depression, which affected national economies worldwide, including Egypt and Sudan, was a consequence of the economic difficulties that emerged after World War I.After noticing some positive progress, the Great Powers in the Arab World and Middle East began to eliminate economic development institutions.Many political factions were encouraged to form opposition against the politicians who dominated parliamentary politics during that period.Development initiatives aimed at stabilizing the economy of the region had become a familiar concept among workers.The government\'s expectations were shaped by state-managed initiatives, which encompassed import regulation, industrial investment, commodity distribution, and production monitoring.Government bodies and formations had to respond to the demands of groups that were directly affected by the changes and withdrawals made by initiatives.A few of these groups comprised of military officers.Although the first military coups in Syria were initiated in the late 1940s, it was the Free Officers coup in Egypt and the revolution of 1952 that had the most significant influence and served as a catalyst for future movements.The membership did not come from the wealthy elite, but rather came from a middle-class background that included young workers, government officials, and junior officers.The movement, which was initiated and propagated during the 1940s, was brought to fruition by Gamal Abdel Nasser\'s leadership.The loyalty and respect of the other members led Nasser to establish a coordinating committee in 1949, where he was appointed as its leader in 1950.Coming from a humble beginning, he represented the hardworking middle class.The Free Officers were made up of urban settlers and educated militants with a lower middle class background.As a hero of war, Nasser rapidly rose to the rank of colonel in the military.He, along with others, worked tirelessly to put an end to the corruption of the government during the 1948 Palestine war and restore democracy.The issue of imperialism\'s domestic passive response was viewed by him as equally significant.A new middle class was fortified by them.Because of their commitment to change, the Free Officers referred to their organization and its entirety as just a "movement."It would eventually turn into a revolution.General Muhammad Naguib was brought on board by the Free Officers Committee as a public face for the victorious coup of 23 July 1952.The Committee of the Free Officers Movement was led by a group of men, including Lieutenant Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, Major Abdallah Hussein, Wing Commander Gamil Salem, and Squadron Chief Ober Oberoi Anwar Ali.Major Hussein el-Shafei (pre-1918 to 2005) and Lieutenant Colonel Zakaria Mohieddin (post-2012) were later included in the committee.Due to British control, Egypt experienced a series of uprisings that resulted in the targeting of British military bases.The Suez Canal Zone saw workers go on strike from 1950-52, but they were impeded by British tanks.The government in Cairo urged nationalists to avoid interfering in public areas that are associated with imperialism.In opposition, the British and their Egyptian counterparts were targeted.The Egyptian nationalist organizations were divided and

Pacific Ocean is home to New Zealand, an island nation.Geographically, the country is made up of two main landmasses: Te Ika-a-Mui on the North Island and Te Waipounamu on South Island, as well as several smaller islands.The Pacific island regions of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga are located approximately 1500 km east of Australia across the Tasman Sea, while New Zealand is roughly 1000 km to the south.Its remoteness meant that it was one of the last places for humans to settle in the lands.During its extended period of isolation, New Zealand developed a unique range of animal, fungal, and plant species.The country\'s varied terrain and towering mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, are largely due to the impact of volcanic eruptions and land uplift.Wellington is the capital city of New Zealand, and Auckland is its most populous city.A unique Mori culture was developed by the Polynesian inhabitants of the islands that would later become New Zealand between 1250 and 1300 CE.The first European to see New Zealand was Abel Tasman, a Dutch explorer who did so in 1642.The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 by British Crown and Mori Chiefs, resulted in New Zealand becoming a British colony.Today, the majority of New Zealand\'s population of 4 is concentrated in this location.7 million people are of European origin;The Mori population is the most populous, with Asians and Pacific Islanders making up the second, third, and fourth largest minority groups.New Zealand\'s culture is largely influenced by Mori and early British colonizers, with the latter having expanded its influence due to increased immigration.English, Mori, and New Zealand Sign Language are the official languages, with English being the most commonly used.The economy of New Zealand is based on market practices, making it a developed nation.New Zealand\'s high-income economy status is backed by the World Bank, which places it highly in international benchmarks for its health, education, economic freedom, and quality of life.The elected, unicameral Parliament has the power to enact laws for the nation, while the Cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister John Key, exercises executive political authority.Queen Elizabeth II is the country\'s head of state and is represented by a Governor-General.New Zealand\'s local government is divided into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities.Tokelau is a constituent of New Zealand\'s Realm and falls under its sovereignty;The Cook Islands and Niue, which are both independent nations in free association with New Zealand;The Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand\'s territorial claim in Antarctica.The Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Pacific Islands Forum, and Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation are all organizations in which New Zealand is a member.In 1642, Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand and named it Staten Landt, possibly because he believed it was linked to a landmass located at the southernmost point of South America.Nova Zeelandia was the new title given to the land by Dutch cartographers in 1645, taking its name from the Dutch province of Zealand.The name of New Zealand was later anglicized by British explorer James Cook.Aotearoa, which means "land of the long white cloud," is the Mori name for New Zealand.It is uncertain whether Mori had a name for the entire country before Europeans arrived, as Aotearoa was originally limited to the North Island.Te Waipounamu or Te Waka o Aoraki were the names given to the canoe of Aori on the South Island, while the North Island was named as Te Ika-a-Mui (the fish of Mnui), which is another nomenclature for the islanders.The North, Middle, and South Islands were categorized as such on early European maps.The use of North and South on maps to differentiate the two largest islands was introduced in 1830 and became standard practice by 1907.The North Island and South Island\'s names were found to be unofficial by the New Zealand Geographic Board in 2009, with alternative names being formalised in 2013.Te Ika-a-Mui in North Island and Te Waipounamu in South Island were the two names chosen for this location.It is important to note that each island can be referred to using either its English or Mori name, or both at the same time.']], [[413, 'from which country do french fries originate?

States and most of Canada, fries are referred to as fried, long-cut pieces of elongated potatoes, while shoestring fries can be found in other countries like the UK, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, and New Zealand.Fast food restaurants often include French fries on their menus as part of their lunch or dinner dishes, and they are usually served hot and crispy, either soft or crunchy, or as a snack.The usual accompaniment for French fries is ketchup, which is usually added and they are salted;In numerous nations, other condiments or toppings like vinegar, mayonnaise, or other local specialties are used as a topside.Poutine and chili cheese fries are examples of dishes that can be topped with more elaborate ingredients.Instead of potatoes, sweet potatoes can be used to make French fries.A baked version of the french fry is also made, typically without excessive oil or fat.Thomas Jefferson provided potatoes in the French style at a White House dinner in 1802.In 1856, the

over.Fry the sides until a light golden brown color is achieved;Eliminate waste through drainage.During the early 1900s, the term "French fried" was being used to describe other foods like chicken and onion rings, which were also called "deep-fried."Although French fried potatoes are the most well-known dish, it is unlikely that this term actually refers to frenching in the sense of julienning.In the past, frenching was solely concerned with removing meat from the shanks of chops.The origin of fries is believed by some to have originated in Belgium, and the debate over their country of origin has been ongoing due to claims from both French and Belgians.According to the Belgian perspective, the adoption of the term "French fries" suggests a dominant French culinary culture that was influenced by mutual ignorance and geographic proximity between France and Belgium.According to Jo Gérard, a journalist from Belgium, potatoes were deep-fried in the Meuse valley before 1680.The absence of a manuscript by Gérard supports this assertion, but it is unrelated to the French fry\'s later history.In the context of 18th century economic conditions, it is highly unlikely that a peasant would use significant amounts of fat in preparation for cooking potatoes.The pan was the only source of sauteed vegetables.The.The."\'\'It is believed by some that the term  French \'\' was coined during World War I when British and American soldiers arrived in Belgium and consumed Belgian fries.Supposedly, they were called  French because it was the official language of the Belgian Army

service?', 'Ceefax, the world\'s first teletext information service, had a voice that was almost identical to " See Facts."The BBC initiated the process in 1974 and concluded on 23 October 2012 at 23:32:19 BST, following the digital switchover being completed in Northern Ireland.The service came to an end after being broadcast for 38 years.Geoff Larkby and Barry Pyatt, two engineers at the BBC\'s Designs Department ( Television Group), worked on an experimental analogue text transmission system during the late 1960s.The intention was to transmit a printable text sheet during the nighttime hours of conventional television transmission.The Director General of the BBC, Sir Hugh Carleton Greene, was keen on making hard copy copies of farming and stock-market prices available through inactive TV transmitters.The BBC Designs Department was given a message that was similar to one page of The Times newspaper during the shutdown.The system utilized a modified rotating drum, facsimile transmitter, and hard-copy printer that was created by Larkby & Pyatt.A raised helix of steel wire was used to pass pressure-trail paper and print onto a drum.Synchronisation of the drum with the transmission drum was achieved through the Muirhead system\'s innate information, such as Start of Page and Start Of Line.The printing process was driven by a hardened steel blade, which was initially powered by an overhead loudspeaker-type moving coil, then by another printed-circuit coil and ultimately, by Brush-Clevite\'s special ceramic piezo element.Through the use of a rotating helix and oscillating moving blade, which were interconnected, the till-roll paper could be drawn as raster.BEEBFAX, the modern term for the BBC and a nickname for their facsimile machine, was coined from the original electro-mechanical system.The first trials were performed in 1969, when Christmas Cards were sent from London to Bristol via the internal telephone system.The project was put on hold because the Muirhead facsimile and printer whining caused the system to be less popular in the Designs Department laboratory.The proposal of using digital technology was put forward by Messrs Larkby & Pyatt, but the electro-mechanical system was ultimately abandoned in 1970.The idea of a fully-electronic version was revisited in digital and on-screen format, known as CEEFAX. The new system was announced in October 1972 and went live on 23 September 1974 after conducting test transmissions in 1972–74.The world\'s first teletext system was created by engineers at the BBC, who were developing ways to provide specialized subtitles for the deaf.The Director of Engineering at the BBC, James Redmond, was a passionate admirer.The idea was soon adopted by other broadcasters, such as the IBA, which had created the ORACLE teletext system that was not compatible with it.Ceefax pages were frequently the first to report breaking stories or headlines before the Internet and World Wide Web became popular.Following technical negotiations, the two broadcasters agreed on a single standard in 1976 that was different from Ceefax and ORACLE, and it eventually became World System Teletext. This standard was used for analogue broadcasts until 2012.Also, the Prestel system adopted a 24-row, 40-column display format.The European teletext system was established using the technology, which replaced other standards like the Antiope system that had been used in France.Starting in 1983, Ceefax broadcasted computer programs called telesoftware for the BBC Micro, a home computer that was accessible in the United Kingdom.Telesoftware broadcasts came to a halt in 1989.A similar concept was used to promote PC software through the use of higher speed technology in the French C Plus Direct satellite channel.Ceefax\'s fundamental technology remains compatible with the 1976 unified rollout;']], [[415, '"the fictional setting grover\'s corner, new hampshire, for the 1938 broadway play

""das kapital""?"', "The analysis of capital: A Critical Approach to Political Economy ();Karl Marx's 1867-1883 work is a crucial theoretical text that has been applied to communist philosophy, economics, and politics.Marx's objective was to uncover the economic patterns that underlie capitalist production, unlike the work of classical political economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill.Karl Marx posits in Capital: Critique of Political Economy ( 1867 ) that the utilization of labor, particularly unpaid work, is the driving force behind capitalism, with surplus value and eventual profit being obtained.The capitalist state's ownership of productive capital assets, which are protected by property rights, allows the employer to claim profits.The production of capital, goods, and services by workers is a result of their ongoing efforts to reproduce the economic conditions through reproduction.Capital proposes to explain the laws of motion in the capitalist economic system from its beginning to the end, describing the dynamics of capital accumulation, wage labor growth, workplace transformation, capital concentration, commercial competition, banking system, decline of profit rate, land-rents, and so on.According to the critique of capitalism's political economy, the commodity is the fundamental building block of a capitalist society. However, unlike other commodity-based forms of production, capitalism treats workers as mere commodities.Furthermore, commerce as a human activity had no moral meaning beyond the purchase and sale of goods and services, leading to the establishment of distinct entities in society's economic, moral, and legal domains.The subjective moral value is distinct from the objective economic value.Political economy, which involves the equitable distribution of wealth and political weight in taxes, eventually separated into three distinct areas of human activity: Economics, Law, and Ethics.The natural history of economic formation in society allows political economists to study the scientific laws of capitalism without bias, as the expansion of the market system of commerce had objectified human economic relations.The utilization of cash nexus dismantled religious and political misconceptions about the economic worth of commodities, leading to the adoption of commodity fetishism.The historical process of economic development in society was not subject to individual control or direction, leading to a global network of social connections among capitalists.The economic development of a society precedes the management of an economy through organized commerce.The wage-worker and the means of production owner relationship, which is exemplified by the opposing movement of labour and capitalists in the gegensätzliche Bewegung, serves as a structural example.The activities of capitalists and workers lead to the activation of these economic contradictions, which remain beyond their immediate perceptions as social classes and individuals.Economic crises, such as those caused by recession and depression.The conditions that promote proletarian revolution are rooted in the opposing nature of the economic value of cell-units in a capitalist society.According to the Communist Manifesto of 1848, capitalists created a weapon that the working class used to oppose the bourgeoisie.Despite the paradoxical nature of economic crisis in a capitalist economy, technological advancements and increased production lead to an increase in material wealth and lower economic value."]], [[418, 'which international cricket side had its best year ever in 2014 with five test wins?', 'The highest level of cricket is test cricket, which has the longest history in the sport.Test

chronological order, typically in prose.The genre has been characterized as having a continuous and comprehensive history of roughly two thousand years.Classical Greece and Rome, medieval romance, early modern romance in the novella tradition are the sources of its origins, as per this viewpoint.During the 18th century, the Italian term for short stories gave rise to the current English word.In his book The Rise of the Novel, published in 1957, Ian Watt suggests that the novel\'s origins can be traced back to the early 18th century, with Miguel de Cervantes being recognized as the first significant European writer of modern times.The initial segment of Don Quixote was printed in 1605.The romance is a lengthy and closely connected narrative in the prose genre.Walter Scott characterized it as a fictional story in written form;While marvels and extraordinary occurrences attract attention, the novel\'s plot revolves around everyday events and the contemporary world.Many historical romances, such as Scott\'s Wuthering Heights and Herman Melville\' s Moby-Dick, are also known as novels.The definition of romance should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or romance novel.The differentiation between romance and novel is absent in other European languages, with the terms roman, der Roman, and romanzo respectively.An extended fictional narrative that depicts intimate human experiences is known as a novel.The modern novel typically employs a literary prose form, and the advancement of printing technology and low-cost paper in the 15th century fostered the growth of the prosometric novel.The term for a lengthy piece of prose fiction in English and Spanish is derived from the Italian novella, which means "new," or "short story."The word  romance is commonly used in European languages, including French, Dutch, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Romanian, Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian.The German equivalent of "Roman";In Portuguese, the term romance is used to describe long-standing stories, while in Italian, it is romanzo.The distinction between fiction and historiography is largely due to the use of fiction as a form of narrative.This criterion can be problematic, though.In the early modern period, historical narrative writers frequently utilized innovations derived from traditional beliefs to enhance a passage of text or validate an opinion.The production and composition of didactic speeches was a common activity among historians.The social, political, and personal realities of a place and time can be captured in novel works that are not commonly found in historical texts.Despite the adoption of literary prose as the standard for the modern novel by authors other than verse, the origins of the contemporary European novel can be traced back to the Romance language in southern France, including those written by Chrétien de Troyes and Geoffrey Chaucer.The Canterbury Tales, spanning from 1343 to 1400.The competition between prose novels and fictional narratives in verse, such as Don Juan by Lord Byron, Yevgeniy Onegin by Alexander Pushkin, and Aurora Leigh by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, persisted even in the 1800s.A more recent example of the verse novel is Vikram Seth\'s The Golden Gate ( 1986), which comprises 590 Onegin stanzas.The use of prose fiction in both Japan and Europe during the 12th and 15th centuries resulted in intimate reading situations.Conversely, verse epics like the Odyssey and Aeneid had been recited to certain audiences, but in a more intimate manner than theatrical performances.']], [[421, 'andy coulson resigned as editor of which british newspaper in 2007?', "An English journalist and political strategist, Andrew Edward (Andy) Coulson was born on January 21,

'Camelot is a group of ungulates with even faces, which have distinctive fatty deposits called "humps" on their back.One-humped camels, also known as dromedary, are the two species that have survived.Dromedarius, a species found in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa;C. is known for the Bactrian camel, which is characterized by its two-humped appearance.Bactrianus, a species found in Central Asia.Both species have been tamed;Their food sources include milk, meat, and hair for textiles or felted pouches, while they are employed in a range of tasks from transporting human work to carrying heavy loads.The term camel is derived from the Hebrew or Phoenician word gml, which are Latin and Greek (also known as camelus and  kamlos respectively).The term  Camel\' is used to describe any of the six Camelidae family mammals, which include camels, llamas and other camelids.The average lifespan of a camel is between 40 and 50 years in the realm of biology.A fully grown adult camel rests on its shoulder and hump.In short bursts, camels can reach speeds of up to 40 km/h.The weight of bacterial camels is 300, while those of the dromedaries are 300.During periods of turmoil, the male dromedary camel exudes a loud and inflatable sac (latest form) as an invasion to control other animals and lure females.It looks like a long, swollen, pink tongue that is hanging out of place in its mouth.The mating behavior of camels involves both males and females sitting on the ground, with the male approaching from behind.Ejaculation occurs three to four times by males during a single mating session.Camelids are the only ungulates that can reproduce while in a sitting position.Ecological and behavioral adaptations in Camels do not allow for direct storage of water in their humps, unlike the previous belief.The humps, which are made up of fatty tissue, concentrate body fat and minimize the insulating impact of it on other parts of the body, aiding camels in adapting to hot climates.The metabolism of this tissue results in the production of more than one gram of water for every pound of fat processed.As fat metabolism and energy release occur, the lungs experience water evaporate during respiration due to the need for oxygen in the metabolic process, resulting in a net loss of water.Camels possess a range of physiological adaptations that enable them to survive for extended periods without any external water intake.In contrast to other mammals, their red blood cells are oval in shape rather than circular.Red blood cells are able to function during dehydration and can tolerate high osmotic variation without damage while drinking water. A 600 kg camel can consume 200 L of water in three minutes.Camels are capable of withstanding changes in body temperature and water intake that would result in the death of most other animals.Their temperatures start at dawn and reach 40 °C by sunset, before they cool off once more at night.In animals, it is crucial to maintain the temperature of their brains.The rete mirabile, a combination of veins and arteries in camels, is utilized to cool the blood and brain.Even at temperatures as low as 49 °C, camels seldom sweat.Perspiration is emitted from the skin rather than the coat surface;The heat generated during vaporization is from the body, not the environment.Most mammals can tolerate dehydration of 12-14% before cardiac failure due to circulatory disturbance, while camels can only tolerate 25% of their body weight lost through sweating.In order to conserve water, camels use their noses to trap and re-absorb water vapor.Despite being exposed to milder conditions, camels that consume green herbage can maintain their bodies\' moisture levels without drinking water.The thick fur of camels shields them from the scorching heat emanating from desert sand;To prevent overheating, a shorn camel must increase its sweating to 50%.']], [[423, 'the archaeological site of the ancient city of troy is in which country?', "The Greeks named themselves Troy, Troia and Ilion, or Ilios.And;The city is commonly known as Tria in the Latin language.The Hittite term Wilusa or Truwisa is a more poetic alternative to Ilium;The city was located in the far northwest region of Asia Minor, which is now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey, and near the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles straits and northwest of Mount Ida during the late Classical antiquity.It is now referred to as Hisarlk.The Greek Epic Cycle, which includes the Iliad, one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer, describes the Trojan War's location.The Iliad and Odyssey provide metric evidence that the name (Ilion) was once beginning with a digamma, as opposed to Wilion.The Hittite designation for the city of Wilusa, which is believed to be identical, also lends support to this.Ilium, a new capital, was established on the site during the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus.It grew and prospered until the establishment of Constantinople, but it gradually declined during the Byzantine period.The year 1865 saw Frank Calvert, an English archaeologist, excavating trial trenches in a field he had purchased from local farmer in Hisarlk. Later, in 1868, Heinrich Schliemann, renowned German businessman and archäologist began to dig in the area after meeting Calf in their hometown of anakkale.The excavations uncovered multiple cities that were built in succession.Initially, Schliemann was doubtful about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy, but Calvert convinced him and took control of his excavations on the eastern half of the Hisrlik site.Wilusa, the Hittite city that likely gave birth to the Greek word, is now associated with Troy VII, which is also commonly referred to as Homeric Troy.The Troia archaeological site's tourist industry is supported by a small village near the ruins, which has been named after the hill at Hisarlk.It is situated in the province of anakkale, which is located some 30 km to the south-west of the provincial capital.The nearest village is Tevfikiye.The map displayed here depicts the adapted Scamander estuary and Ilium located a little ways back across the Homeric plain.The UNESCO World Heritage list was added to Troy in 1998.The Trojan War was placed in the timeline of the Homeric Troy by various Ancient Greek historians, with Eratosthenes slated for 1184 BC, Herodotus for 1250 BC and Duris of Samos for 1334 BC.Archaeologists of today associate the Homeric Troy region with archaeological Troy VII.In the Iliad, the Achaeans established a camp near the River Scamander's mouth, which is believed to be the present-day Karamenderes, where their ships were beached.The city of Troy was situated on a hillside, across from the plain of Scamander, where the Trojan War's battles were conducted.The ancient city's location is approximately 5 km from the present coast, but 3,000 years ago, it was closer to the mouths of Scamander, which formed a natural harbour and were now filled with sediment.Recent geological discoveries have enabled the identification of the coastline in ancient Troy, which supports the accuracy of Homeric geography.November 2001 saw the arrival of geologist John C.Classicist John V and Kraft from the University of Delaware.Luce, who was associated with Trinity College in Dublin, showcased the results of research conducted on the geology of the area since 1977.After reviewing the landscapes and coastal features described in both the Iliad and classical sources such as Strabo's Geographi, they concluded that there is consistent consistency between the location of Schliemann'Storage (Schlutzag) and other locations.The Odyssey and other ancient Greek literature, in addition to the Iliad, contain mentions of Troy.In his Aeneid, Virgil elaborates on the Homeric legend of Troy."]], [[424, 'what taxonomic rank comes between family and species?', 'Biology defines a species as an insect.The word species is abbreviated as spp when used in its plural form.A taxonomic rank is a fundamental element of biological classification.The largest group of organisms that can produce fertile offspring, typically through sexual reproduction, are commonly referred to as a species.Although the definition is often adequate, the species problem is a significant challenge in defining species.A species complex is a group of closely related species that have such similar appearances that the boundaries between them are often unclear.The similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche are all ways to differentiate.Locally adapted traits can divide species into infraspecific taxonomic groups, such as subspecies, while botany also employs other types like varieties, subvarieties, and formae.The classification of species with similar ancestors is determined by their similarities to a single genus.The similarity between species is determined by comparing their physical traits and, where appropriate, their DNA sequences.All species are identified by a two-part name, known as  binomial names or simply standardized names.The first segment of a binomial species is the genus that it belongs to.Either the specific name or the particular epithet, which is used in botany and can also be used within zoology, are both included in the second part.Boa constrictor is among the four species that belong to the Boaves genus, for instance.The genus is capitalized, but not the specific epithet.The binomial is highlighted in italics when printed and underlined in handwriting.Reliable methods for identifying specific species and stating biological theories, as well as measuring biodiversity, necessitate the use of a usable definition of the term  species, although other taxonomic levels such as families may be taken into account in large-scale studies.Extinct species that are only known from fossils often require higher taxonomic levels, such as families, for fossil-based studies.It has been estimated that there are 8 species in the world that are not believed to be bacterial or archaeal.The previous estimates of 7 million were varying between two million and 100 million.During the origins of science, a species was defined as an individual organism that made up dozens of similar or almost identical organisms.The group was the only one that hinted at other relationships.Genus and species were used by Aristotle to signify specific categories.According to pre-Darwinian scientists, including Aristotle, the species were unchanging and unchanged, similar to chemical elements.The development of organizational systems for living things by early observers led to the insertion of previously isolated species into a context.The early delineation schemes that were adopted are now considered whimsical, with consanguinity based on color or behavior, such as snakes, scorpions and certain biting ants.The first person to provide a biological explanation for the term  species was John Ray, an English naturalist who lived in 1686.The.The.There is no other criterion that has been more helpful in identifying species than the unique traits that persist during their transmission from seed.The differences between individuals and species, arising from the seed of the same plant, are inadvertent and not distinguishable as distinct species.The.The.Animals that are distinct in their species conservation efforts maintain their unique species forever;No two species can ever be derived from the same seed, and neither does the other.In the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish scientist, classified organisms based on their shared physical traits rather than differences.He introduced the notion of a taxonomic hierarchy of classification that relied on observable traits and was intended to reflect natural connections.Despite their similar appearances, it was still widely believed that there was no organic association between species during that time.The belief that the categories of life are determined by God in a hierarchical manner was influenced by European scholarly and religious education during that time.']], [[425, 'what is the

Minnesota are located to its south.The Aboriginal peoples have been living in Manitoba for thousands of years.When it was part of Rupert\'s Land, fur traders started to arrive in the area during the late 17th century.The Métis people\'s rebellion against the Government of Canada during the Red River Rebellion, which occurred in 1867, was triggered by negotiations for the establishment of the province of Manitoba.After the rebellion was put to an end, the Parliament of Canada passed the Manitoba Act in 1870, which led to the creation of the province of Manitoba.The eighth-largest Census Metropolitan Area in Canada is Winnipeg, which is also the capital and largest city of Manitoba.Manitoba\'s Legislative Assembly and Provincial Court are both situated in Winnipeg, which is also the city where the government is based.Winnipeg is home to four of the five provincial universities and all four professional sports teams.Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Steinbach, Thompson, Winkler, Selkirk, Dauphin, Morden, and Flin Flon are among the other cities in the province.The Cree, Ojiboine, or Assinibuine languages are thought to be the roots of Manitoba\'s name.This name was coined from the Cree manitou-wapow or Ojibwa manidoobaa, which both denote the straits of Manitoulin or "Great Spirit," and refer to The Narrows in Lake Manitoba.The Assiniboine may also be the source of the name " Lake ofthe Prairie".French divers drew the name of the lake, Lac des Prairies.The name was proposed by Thomas Spence to designate a new republic in the area south of the lake.The name was chosen by Louis Riel, the leader of the Métis, and was accepted in Ottawa under the Manitoba Act of 1870.The eastern and western provinces of Ontario and Saskatchewan, the northern territories of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, and northwestern states of North Dakota and Minnesota are adjacent to Manitoba.Its saltwater coastline is unique among prairie provinces, and it lies northeast of Hudson Bay.Canada\'s only arctic deep-water port, the Port of Churchill, is the most efficient shipping path between North America and Asia.Lake Winnipeg ranks as the tenth-largest freshwater lake globally.The world\'s second-largest bay is Hudson Bay.The Hudson Bay watershed, which was once called Rupert\'s Land, is centered around Manitoba.With its abundance of rivers and lakes, the Hudson\'s Bay Company considered this a crucial area for the profitable fur trade.The saltwater coastline that runs along the coast of Hudson Bay is bordered by over 110,000 lakes, which cover an area of

December 2003. The High Court later determined that he would be subject to mandatory minimum prison terms of 40 years.Maxine Ann Carr, his girlfriend, was the teaching assistant for the girls at St Andrew's Primary

secondary school in College Close.After spotting the girls, Huntley invited them to his home.According to him, his girlfriend, Maxine Carr, who was a teaching assistant at St Andrew's Primary School, was also in the house.In reality, she had gone to Grimsby, Lincolnshire to see her family.The girls were murdered by Huntley shortly after they entered his house.The reason behind Huntley's murder of Wells and Chapman remains unknown, but it is believed that he had reportedly pressed the phone down on Carr after an intense argument.According to Huntley, Carr was suspected of cheating on him.Huntley was believed by the police to have killed the girls out of jealousy.This was suspected by Huntley's mother, as per her statement.The police did not uncover any indication of premeditation.The police released photographs of the missing girls wearing Manchester United football shirts and gave them a detailed description of their physical attributes, including white, slim,

community.According to a reporter, Huntley was possibly the last person to have conversed with either of the girls before they went missing.Despite the uncertainty of their disappearance, Huntley told television crews that there is still hope and trust in those who have been searching for them during the second week.In the early stages of the inquiry, a woman from Little Thetford claimed that she had seen two girls who resembled Wells and Chapman while walking past her home.A white van was seized by the police from an area of caravan park in Wentworth, which is roughly 10 miles away from

went missing south of Soham, onto the Studlands Park housing estate in Newmarket.The public announcement of this sighting was made on August 13th.A dog walker who was walking his dog called the police that evening to report two piles of earth at Warren Hill, outside Newmarket.It was suggested that these could be the final resting places of the two missing girls.Despite the absence of any indication of either girl, an overnight inspection revealed that the mounds of earth were badger nests.During the same period, Staffordshire authorities stated that the disappearance of the girls was connected to an abduction in the county last year, where a six-year-old girl had survived being kidnapped by someone who was still at large and whose green Ford Mondeo had number plates stolen in

men's bronze medal competition.The city's name, Caerdydd, is derived from the earlier Welsh word Caferdo.The alteration of Welsh f and dd from -dyf to 'dary' is indicative of the informal transition, which may have been motivated by folk etymology (as opposed to an exact counterpart for?').This type of sound change was most likely introduced in the Middle Ages;The Tudor period saw the emergence of both forms.The origins of Caerdyf can be traced back to post-Roman Brythonic words that denote the fort of the Traders.The fortification is likely to be associated with the one established by the

cited and studied by contemporary scholars to gain insight into the religious and political structures of Ancient Greece and its society, as well as to comprehend the nature of myth creation.Vase-paintings and votive gifts are examples of Greek representational arts, which implicitly reflect Greek mythology through a large number of narratives.In the Greek myth, there are numerous deities, gods, goddesses and heroes, as well as heroic figures and creatures that recount their lives and adventures.These stories were initially disseminated through an oral tradition;Today, Greek literature is the primary source of knowledge about Greek myths.Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the oldest Greek literary sources, primarily focus on the Trojan War and its aftermath.The Theogony and the Works and Days, two poems by Homer's contemporary Hesiod, contain accounts of the world' genesis, divine rulers succession, human ages, the origin of human suffering, and religious sacrifice.Myths are present in various parts of the Bible, including Homeric Hymns, Epic Cycle fragments and lyric poems, Hellenistic Age scholars and poets like Plutarch and Pausanias.Archaeological finds are a primary source of information about Greek mythology, with gods and heroes being prominently featured in the decoration of many artifacts.The eighth century BC saw the emergence of geometric pottery that portrays scenes from the Trojan cycle and Heracles' exploits.Homeric and other mythological scenes are added to the literary evidence during the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic eras.The culture, arts, and literature of Western civilization have been greatly shaped by Greek mythology, which still holds significance in the language and heritage of this region.The themes have been inspired by Greek mythology and have gained contemporary significance and relevance among poets and artists, dating back to ancient times.Greek literature and visual media from the Geometric period from c. are the primary sources of the current knowledge about Greek mythology.From 900 to 800 BC.In reality, literary and archaeological sources merge, sometimes with mutual support and sometimes without reciprocity;The corpus of data being present is a strong indication that many aspects of Greek mythology have robust historical and factual foundations.Nearly all genres of Greek literature rely on Mythical narration in their literary texts.The Library of Pseudo-Apollodorus was the only surviving general mythical manual from Greek antiquity.The purpose of this work is to reconcile the conflicting narratives of the poets and offers a comprehensive summary of traditional Greek mythology and heroic tales.Apollodorus of Athens was present from c.Between 180-125 BC, he wrote extensively on various subjects.The collection may have been influenced by his writings;The  Library's content documents events that took place decades after his passing, giving rise to the name Pseudo-Apollodorus.The Iliad and the Odyssey, written by Homer, are among the earliest literary sources.The  epic cycle was completed by other poets, but their later and lesser works are now mostly lost.The  Homeric Hymns, despite their traditional name, are not directly connected to Homer.The Lyric age saw the creation of choral hymns.Hesiod, who may have been a contemporary with Homer,

holst describe as the ‘winged messenger’?', 'Planets are astronomical objects that orbit stars or remnants of stars and have the potential to be rounded by their own gravity, but not undergo thermonuclear fusion.This definition is derived from two different IAU declarations;In 2006, the IAU agreed to a formal definition for non-Solar systems, and in 2001/2003, they established an informal working definition.The Solar System is the only place where the 2006 definition applies, while the 2003 definition only mentions planets orbiting other stars.The 2006 IAU conference was informed that the issue of extrasolar planets was too complex to be resolved.Ancient myths, religion, science, astrology and mythology all have connections to the term planet.Various planets in the Solar System are visible to the naked eye.Many early cultures considered these peoples to be divine beings or messengers of gods.The evolution of scientific knowledge resulted in the modification of people\'s perception of planets, encompassing various dissimilar items.In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a resolution to define planets in the Solar System.Many objects of planet-mass are excluded by this definition due to their orbital location or characteristics, making it a controversial definition.Despite the fact that eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 were still considered planets according to modern terminology, some celestial bodies like Ceres, Pallas and Juno, as well as Vesta and Pluto have been declassified from the scientific community.Ptolemy believed that the planets revolved around Earth in benevolent orbits and had epicycles.Despite being proposed on numerous occasions, the notion that the planets revolve around the Sun was not supported by evidence until the 17th century, when Galileo GalILEI conducted the first astronomical observations.Johannes Kepler scrutinized the observation data and discovered that the planets\' orbits were not circular but elliptical.The advancement of observational equipment enabled astronomers to recognize that the planets, much like Earth, rotated along tilted axes and had common features such as seasonal ice caps and seasons.Since the start of the Space Age, space probes have been closely observing Earth and other planets and discovering similarities in features such as volcanic activity, hurricanes, tectonics (upper crust), and hydrology.The two main categories of planets are giant low-density and small rocky terrestrials.According to IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System.The four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are positioned further from the Sun, followed by the four giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.Six planets are orbiting one or more natural satellites.The Milky Way has yielded more than two thousand extrasolar planets or exoplanets around other stars.Currently, there are more than 100 extrasolar planets discovered in planetary systems, including several astronomical clusters, with nine of them being the same distance from Earth as the Sun.e.Within the cultivated area...The Kepler Space Telescope team announced on December 20, 2011, that they had discovered the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets, Keppler-20e and Keppeler/20f, orbiting a Sun-like star called Kepfler-20.An average of at least 1 was estimated by a study conducted in 2012 using gravitational microlensing data.There are 6 planets that can be attached to any star in the Milky Way.It is believed that one in every five Sun-like stars has a planet of Earth-sized size in their habitable zone.

The Cape Malay people's cuisine, which has Indo-Asian characteristics and cooking styles from neighbouring colonist countries like Portuguese Mozambique, is a product of this process.Indigenous cooking during the precolonial period was characterized by the use of a diverse range of foods, including fruits, nuts and other wild plant products, as well as hunting game.Since 10,000 BC, the introduction of domestic cattle and grain crops to southern regions by Bantu speakers from central Africa and the dissemination of cattle keeping to Khoisan groups have facilitated the availability of fresh meat on demand.The pre-colonial era's eating pattern was primarily focused on cooked grains, particularly sorghum, fermented milk (similar to yogurt), and roasted or steweMaize was once the primary grain, replacing sorghum, and there is some disagreement about whether it was introduced by European colonizers (especially Portuguese) or spread through Africa before white people arrived via Africans returning from the Americas during the slave trade.People kept sheep and goats, and communities often arranged extensive hunts for game;Beef was regarded as the most crucial and highly esteemed meat.The chief of a village was given the prized ribs from any cattle that were slaughtered in many communities.Many South African families trace their daily meals back to the indigenous foods consumed by their ancestors.In Bantu-speaking South Africa, the common dish is a thick and fluffy maize meal mixed with stewed meat gravy.The use of fermented pap, especially in urban areas where it is often sorghum instead of maize, can result in a pungent taste.The Sotho-Tswana refer to this fermented pap as  ting.Pumpkins are a common vegetable in South Africa, but they are also grown in other countries.Although not native to the area, rice and beans are still widely consumed.South Africans have embraced a vegetable dish that originated with Irish immigrants, such as shredded cabbage and white potatoes cooked with butter.The heart of most meals in South Africa is often centered around meat.Roasted meat and dried meat were both consumed by the Khoisan for future consumption.The Southern African culture's love for barbecue and biltong is a reflection of their diet.Unlike in the past when cattle was the primary means of subsistence for men in rural areas, South Africans now have a preference for beef.In addition to beef, South Africans enjoy a variety of other meats as supplementary dishes.During the weekend, South African families often enjoy a  braai meal that includes grilled meat and maize meal, followed by pap and vleis.The consumption of meat is a part of both traditional and modern South African traditions, with ritualistic connotations.During special events like weddings, initiations and family gatherings in Bantu culture, families purchase live animals to slaughter at home and prepare a large meal for the community or nearby area.According to the participants, spilling animal blood on the ground makes the ancestors feel content as they gather around the carcass in an invisible manner.During holiday weekends, entrepreneurs will create sanctuaries for live animals, mostly sheep and goats, along townships' main roads, for families to purchase, slaughter, cook, and eat."]], [[433, 'the isle of capri is close to which

etymology of " kapros" has been validated by the discovery of wild boar fossils.In contrast, the Romans named Capri as an island with goats.There is a chance that the name of the island was derived from an Etruscan word for  rocky\', but there is no consensus on whether they had ever ruled over it.Capri is a massive rock that is composed of both limestone and sandstone.The island\'s topography is defined by cliffs, with the sides of the island being perpendicular.Between 1920 and 1923, Edwin Cerio served as the mayor of Capri under his government.The government\'s role and nature on the island were significantly impacted by his vision and policies, even though he had only been in power for three years.The principles that Capri has adopted as part of Italy are also present in the country, which is a Republic.The island\'s voters elect representatives for the two villages on the island.The elected officials then select two mayors to lead their respective governments.Since the early days of the Roman Empire, the city has been inhabited.The presence of human settlement was confirmed during the Roman era;During the excavation of the Augustus villa\'s foundations, Suetonius reported the discovery of giant bones and "stone weapons."The emperor mandated the placement of these in the garden of his primary residence, the Sea Palace.Modern excavations have uncovered evidence of human occupation of the island during both the Neolithic and Bronze Age.Capri was invented by Augustus;He constructed temples, villas and aqueducts as well as gardens to enjoy his own private paradise.Virgil\'s Aeneid describes the island as being inhabited by the Greek people of Teleboi, who came from the Ionian Islands.According to Strabo, Capri had two towns in ancient times but eventually became a single one.Twelve Imperial villas were reported by Tacitus in Capri.The remains of Tragara were still visible in the 19th century.The Villa Jovis, which is one of the best-preserved Roman villas in Italy, is the most well-known villa among the many built by Tiberius at Capri.In 27 AD, Tiberius made the decision to permanently settle in Capri and governed the Empire until his death in 37 AD.Emperor Commodus exiled his sister Lucilla to Capri in 182 AD.She was put to death shortly after.Capri reverted to being controlled by Naples after the Western Roman Empire\'s collapse, and was subjected to multiple pirate attacks and destruction.The island was given to Amalfi by Emperor Louis II in 866.Capri, Scala, Minori, and Lettere were designated as suffragans of Amalfi after Pope John XV consecrated the first bishop of the city in 987, making it a metropolitan see.']], [[434, 'who was declared model of the millennium by vogue editor anna wintour?', 'Anna

However, upon returning home, he discovers that Arshad, Uzma, and their companions are already present.Arshad was impressed by Mahmud\'s apparent devotion to Islam and subsequently granted permission for the marriage of Rashid and Uzma, but was eventually apprehended by police, media, and angry Jews in attendance.He shouts out in desperation that he is Jewish, exonering him of any wrongdoing.Uzma and his friends leave Arshad in a state of disgust.Mahmud\'s family deserts him for his deceit, and a colleague at work quits, leading to him drinking.He becomes suicidal, but Lenny intervenes to rescue him after hearing the news report.Mahmud visits the old age home and asks to meet his deceased father, only to discover that he has passed away.In Izzy\'s room, Mahmud can access the video

speaks on behalf of himself, Jewish individuals, and Muslims.Arshad was revealed to the crowd by Mahmud as Gary Page, a self-proclaimed devout Muslim cleric who had become disgraced in the public eye

of the opposite gender, which is achieved through dynamic repression.e.Males have a preference for their mothers, while females are partial to their fathers.The Oedipus complex occurs in the third phase of psychosexual development, which includes the oral, anal, phallic, latent, and genital stages.Initially, the Oedipal complex denotes the son\'s desire for sexual relations with his mother and is not dependent on reciprocation.The term "Oedipus complex" was coined by Sigmund Freud to describe the desire for parental dominance in both males and females.The term "Electra complex" introduced by Carl Gustav Jung to describe the Oedipus complex exhibited in young girls was deprecated by him.Freud proposed that boys and girls have varying experiences of the complex, with boys experiencing castration anxiety and daughters experiencing penis envy.Neurosis, pedophilia, and homosexuality may arise from the complex\'s failure.The solution to the complex is for a child to identify with the same-sex parent.In the Oedipal and Electra stages of psychosexual development, individuals who are fixated can be seen as being either mother-fixed or father-fixated.During adulthood, individuals may be forced to choose a sexual partner who shares similarities with their parents.Oedipus, a character in the Greek mythological family from the 5th century BC, is known for accidentally killing his father Laius and marrying his mother Jocasta.The mythical character Oedipus Rex was created by Sophocles, who wrote a play on it.In 429 BC,The 19th century saw the staging of modern productions of Sophocles\' play in Paris and Vienna, which achieved great success in the 1880s and 1890s.The Austrian psychiatrist Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was present.He suggested in his 1899 book The Interpretation of Dreams that Oedipal desires are a psychological phenomenon that is inherent to all humans and can lead to unconscious guilt.This was based on his analysis of the play\'s emotions, anecdotal evidence of neurotic or normal children, and the fact that Oedipus Rex was effective on both ancient and modern audiences.The play Hamlet shares its origins with Oedipus Rex and the differences between the two plays are clear, as he stated.The child\'s wishful fantasies are made tangible as if they were in a dream by Oedipus Rex.The repression in Hamlet persists;Similar to a neurosis, we only recognize its existence due to its inhibiting effects.Freud argues in The Interpretation of Dreams that the "primary desires and fears" that are part of Sophocles\' concern and the foundation of the Oedipal complex are inherent in the myths it is based on, rather than being primarily a result of its own.The Oedipus complex\'s theoretic development is outlined by Freud in six stages.Between 1897 and 1909,The death of his father in 1896 and the viewing of Oedipus Rex by Sophocles led Freud to use the term as an early reference to him.Freud\'s 1897 letter revealed that he felt a constant love for his mother and jealousy towards his father.In my opinion, this is a common happening during the early years of one\'s life.The second phase of the process.Between 1909 and 1914,Affirms that Oedipal desire is the nuclear complex present in every neuron;']], [[440, 'who wrote the novel ‘seven pillars of wisdom’?', 'The autobiographical account of the experiences of

serious injury for almost two years, his junior year saw him embark on international tours and experience some success.He rapidly advanced in the ATP rankings and eventually reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon Championships in 1996.Henman's career was marked by his expertise in grass, but he only gained confidence playing on clay and hard courts before retiring, including reaching the semi-finals of both the French and US Open in 2004.Henman's decline began in 2005, and he never advanced beyond the third round of a Grand Slam tournament.Henman ended his career in tennis at the end of 2007, but he still participates in events such as the ATP Champions Tour.Henman was born in Oxford, Oxfordshire, as the youngest of three boys in a family.Tony, Henman's father and a solicitor, had varying talents, such as tennis, hockey, and squash.Tim's mother, Jane, who was a dress designer, played at Junior Wimbledon and introduced him and his siblings, Michael and Richard, to the sport

Lindisfarne, an Irish monk who died on August 31, 651.He established a monastic cathedral on Lindisfarne Island, acted as the island's first bishop, and traveled extensively throughout the countryside, disseminating the gospel to both the Anglo-Saxon nobility and the socially excluded classes, including children and slaves.The Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion have all acknowledged him as a saint, and he is also known as the Apostle of Northumbria.The biography of Aidan, written by Bede, is the foundation for most biographical sketches, regardless of whether they are classical or modern.The reliability of Bede's legacy is bolstered by the fact that there is little information available about his early years, except for his young age as an Irish-born monk at the ancient monastery on Iona Island.Aidan was recognized for his unwavering dedication to self-discipline.OCA is being utilized by the organization.Find out more about St. Aidan, the Bishop of Lindesfarne, by visiting www.org.aints.lives/2014/09/31/102445.Prior to Aidan's mission, the Roman Empire had spread Christianity across Britain but not Ireland, which was being largely replaced by Anglo-Saxon paganism.The religion was largely supported by Oswald of Northumbria, a young nobleman who had been brought up in exile since 616 in the monastery of Iona founded by Columba of the Irish Church.Upon being baptized as a Christian, the young ruler pledged to revive Christianity for his subjects upon inheriting the Northumbrian throne in 634.King Oswald requested missionaries to be sent from Iona's monasteries, as he was historically linked to the community.They initially sent Cormán, a bishop, but his harshness caused him to alienate many people. He later returned to Iona, explaining that the Northumbrians were too stubborn to embrace Christianity.Cormán's methods were criticized by Aidan, who was sent to replace him in 635.The Powicke Handbook of British Chronology p.Through his missionary work, Aidan united with the pious monarch and selected Lindisfarne Island as the location for his diocese, which was close to the royal castle at Bamburgh.Aidan, an inspired missionary, would walk from village to village, engaging in conversation and slowly engaging people in Christianity while promoting the early apostolic model of conversion by offering them the milk of gentle doctrine and nourishing them with the Divine Word before moving on to more advanced precepts.Through a patient conversation with local people and an active involvement in their societies, Aidan and his monks successfully brought Christianity back to the Northumbrian countryside.After his exile, King Oswald had a flawless understanding of Irish and was frequently required to translate for Aidan and his monks, who were not proficient in English.Throughout his years of evangelizing, Aidan was accountable for the creation of churches, monasteries, and schools across Northumbria.He gained fame for his unwavering loyalty to charity and the needy, such as by offering accommodation, meals, and education to orphans while also using his donations to help free slaves. He avoided riding a horse during journeys due to urgent circumstances; nonetheless, he frequently traveled on foot across the country and between towns and cities.He invited rich and poor individuals to participate in the mystery of religion, whether they were believers or non-believers, and encouraged them to do good by offering alms and performing good deeds.His daily routine involved reading scriptures and psalms, as well as studying sacred truths."]], [[449, 'whom was ronald reagan referring to when he uttered the famous phrase "evil empire" in a 1983 speech?', 'Ronald Wilson Reagan

1967 to 1975, before becoming President.After graduating from Eureka College in 1932, Ronald Reagan spent his childhood in small northern Illinois families and worked as a sports announcer on various regional radio stations.He moved to Hollywood in 1937 and began acting in a few major films.The Screen Actors Guild, the labor union for actors, had Reagan as its President twice, and he worked to eliminate Communist influence.During the 1950s, he ventured into television and provided motivational talks at General Electric factories.Throughout his political career, he had been a staunch supporter of the Democratic party.He embraced conservative values and joined the Republican Party in 1962.In 1964, Reagan gained national recognition as a conservative advocate by giving scathing speech in support of Barry Goldwater\'s unsuccessful presidential campaign, entitled " A Time for Choosing."He gained a group of supporters and was elected as Governor of California in 1966.During his tenure as governor, Reagan implemented tax increases, converted the state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged university protesters, instructed National Guard troops to participate in 1969 and 1970, respectively, and was returned as president in 1970.In 1968 and 1976, he was defeated in his bid for the Republican nomination;After four years, he won the nomination by surprise and went on to become the oldest President ever, surpassing Jimmy Carter in 1980.Reagan took on significant political and economic initiatives upon becoming president in 1981.Reaganomics, the economic policies that governed supply-side economies, promoted tax rate reduction as a means of stimulating economic growth, money supply control to prevent inflation, economic deregulation, and reduced government spending.During his initial term, he managed to survive an assassination attempt, intensified the War on Drugs, and engaged in public-sector labor.During his two terms, inflation dropped from 12 to zero during his economic policies.The percentage is 5:4.The real GDP growth rate is an average of 3.4 percent;Although Reagan implemented cuts in domestic discretionary spending, the increase in military spending led to an overall rise in federal expenditures, even after accounting for inflation.Reagan\'s reelection campaign was driven by his belief that America was "Morning in America," ultimately resulting in the largest electoral college win in history in 1984.His second term saw him focusing on foreign affairs, which included the resolution of the Cold War, the bombing of Libya, and the Iran-Contra scandal.By referring to the Soviet Union as an evil empire, he changed his Cold War strategy from détente to rollback by initiating an arms race with the USSR and engaging in talks with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, which resulted in the signing of the INF Treaty and the reduction of both countries\' nuclear arsenals.President Reagan\'s famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate included a call to Gorbachev to "demolish this wall"!.The fall of the Berlin Wall occurred five months after he left office, and the Soviet Union disintegrated on December 26, 1991, almost three years later.Reagan\'s approval rating reached sixty-eight percent when he left office in 1989, matching that of Franklin D.The modern era saw Roosevelt and Bill Clinton receiving the highest ratings from former presidents.While Reagan had been planning for his post-presidency, he revealed his Alzheimer\'s disease in 1994 and made an appearance at the funeral of Richard Nixon that year.In 2004, he passed away at the age of 93, ten years after.He is a symbol of the Republican party and holds favorable views in both public and critical circles.S.The United States experienced a

promote its party\'s platform.In societies with strict censorship, propaganda was ubiquitous and highly productive.It penetrated the social and natural sciences, resulting in the development of pseudo-scientific theories like Lysenkoism, while real-world knowledge areas such as genetics, cybernetics or comparative linguistics were censured and banned as "bourgeois pseudoscience".Truths were repressed and lies were constantly being exposed in all areas of life, including print, online, and in school.Glavlit, the primary Soviet censorship body, utilized its power to remove unwanted printed materials and to apply the appropriate ideological spin to every article.Those who spoke against the  Party line were subject to imprisonment or punitive psychiatry.Writer Isaac Babel confided in a close friend that the man talks to his wife only at night when he is completely unconcerned about their relationship, with the blankets pulled over his head.According to Peter Kenez, the Russian

lack of interest, as per Kenez, resulted in their abandonment of propaganda.The concept of propaganda was incorporated into education.The primary objective of Communist propaganda was to create a new man through the use of media schools and youth organizations.The  petit-bourgeois family was excluded from the next generation of educated children through schools and Communist youth organizations like Komsomol.The notion that parents were responsible for raising children was explicitly refuted.According to a schooling theorist, it is crucial to mold the youth into Communists.Like soft wax,

corners and political shrines have been established in all schools to display propaganda about the founder of the Soviet state, who is considered a god.Soviet leadership was honored through marches, songs, and pledges of allegiance in schools.The aim was to make children understand that their participation in the World revolution is more significant than any familial ties.Pavlik Morozov, who betrayed his father to the secret police NKVD, was promoted as a positive role model.Teachers in economics and social sciences were primarily responsible for teaching the unbreakable link between Marxist and Leninist perspectives.The plan for educating children that had been approved by the top was strictly enforced, which could lead to problems with social events that were not part of the plan.The expulsion or abuse of children who had socially alienating elements was a common outcome in the name of class struggle.The Communists\' efforts to spread literacy and numeracy led many teachers to adopt their plans for schooling during the early years of the regime.The indoctrination of children was heavily influenced by Young Pioneers, the youth group.They were instructed to be sincere and uncompromising, and to confront the opponents of socialism.The Young Pioneers were completely influenced by the indoctrination that took place in the 1930s.The use of Radio Radio was beneficial, particularly for reaching the uneducated;Radio receivers were installed in communal areas where peasants had to be present to hear news, such as rationing changes, and were given propaganda broadcasts.Posters were also utilized in some of these spots.']], [[451, 'who was european footballer of the year for 1973 and 1974?', 'Hendrik Johannes  Johan \'\' Cruijff OON" is an

located in Russia.The Sunzha River is the location of the city.The 2010 Census reported a population of 271,573 in the area.The number of individuals recorded in the 1989 Census was 399,688, which was only about two-thirds higher than the 2002 Census\'s 210,720.The Russian word for "Grogeny" translates to "so great, so frightening," or "unbelievable," just like the term "Ivan Grozny/Ivania the Terrible."The official name of the city in Chechen is the same as its nickname, but it is known as  "\'\'" which means the town on the Sunzha River.Dzhokhar Dudayev, who served as the first President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, was honored in 1996 when the city was renamed Dzerkekhorshta by the separatists during their fierce fighting in Afghanistan.Despite being rejected by his son Ramzan Kadyrov, who is now the republic\'s prime minister and later President, the Chechen parliament voted in December 2005 to rename the city to Akhmadkala (after Akhnemedov).The Russian fortress, Groznaya, and other historical sites are present in the narrative.Hence,General Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov founded a Russian military outpost on the Sunzha River in 1818.The Chechens fired at the workers during the construction of the fort.A cannon was positioned by the Russians outside the walls to resolve the issue.When night fell, the Chechens emerged from their hiding places to take away all other guns that had been opened with grapeshots.Once the Chechens had made a breakthrough and started moving their bodies away, the guns were fired again.The number of fatalities exceeded 200.The baptism of fire was inflicted on the "terrible" fort.During the Caucasian War, it was a significant military outpost.After the Russian Empire annexed the area, it was no longer suitable for military use as the old fortress was renamed Grozny and granted town status in December 1869.Grozny is currently the source of a website.Vrcal is the name given to it.Visit com/stories/vaxman for more information.The htm code stands for "аксман.".The town\'s population, mostly Terek Cossacks, experienced a slow growth until the early 1900s when oil reserves were discovered.This facilitated the swift advancement of industry and petrochemical manufacturing.In addition to the oil fields that were drilled in the city, it became a focal point of Russia\'s oil field network and was included in Transcaucasia-Russia Proper railway in 1893.The population experienced a near-doubling in size between 1897 and 1913, going from 15,600 to 30,400.The Soviet regional capital was founded on November 8th, 1917, by the Bolsheviks led by N., one day after the October Revolution.Anisimov took control of Grozny.The 12th Red Army was established by the Proletariat during the escalating Russian Civil War, and the garrison successfully defended against Terek Cossack attacks from August 11 to November 12 in 1918.The Bolsheviks were compelled to retreat after the arrival of Denikin\'s troops, and the White Army took over Grozny on February 4th, 1919.The city was finally united with the Russian SFSR on March 17, following underground operations that only allowed the arrival of the Red Army\'s Caucasus front in 1920.It was incorporated into the Soviet Mountain Republic, which was established on January 20th, 1921, and served as the capital of the Chechen National Okrug.After the dissolution of the mountain republic on November 30th, 1922, the Chechen Autonomous Oblast was created as a national entity, with Grozny serving as its administrative seat.The majority of the people were still of Russian descent, but with Cossack ancestry.Moscow encouraged the migration of Chechens from the mountains to the city as a means of countering the perceived threat posed by Cossacks.In 1936, the region\'s ASSR was created as the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Oblast after being established in 1934.In 1944, the entire population of Chechens and Ingush rebelled against Soviet rule and were

the Spencer family, were the parents of Churchill.The charismatic politician Lord Randolph Churchill, who held the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer, was his father.His mother, Jennie Jerome, was a socialite hailing from America.His time as a young army officer was marked by active duty in British India, the Anglo-Sudan War, and the Second Boer War.He achieved fame as a war correspondent and authored books about his military campaigns.He was a prominent figure in politics for fifty years, serving in various cabinet and political roles.Prior to the First World War, he was part of Asquith\'s Liberal government and held positions as President of the Board of Trade, Home Secretary, and First Lord of an Admiralty.He remained in his role as First Lord of the Admiralty during the war, but he was forced to step down following the Gallipoli Campaign.He briefly resumed his active military service on the Western Front, where he served as the commander of the 6th Battalion ofthe Royal Scots Fusiliers.Under Lloyd George\'s leadership, he returned to the government and served as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, then Secretary-General for Air, and finally Secretary Of State in charge of the Colonies.He was unable to participate in Parliament for two years before being appointed as the Chancellor of the Exchequer during Baldwin\'s Conservative government from 1924 to 1929. This government returned the sterling to its pre-war level, a move that is widely believed to have caused deflation and further pressure on the UK economy.In the 1930s, Churchill was left to campaign for rearmament and warn against Nazi Germany due to his opposition to increased home rule for India and his abdication of Edward VIII.He was once again entrusted with the role of First Lord of the Admiralty when World War II broke out.The resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940 resulted in Churchill becoming Prime Minister.During the difficult period of 1940-41, when the British Commonwealth and Empire was in complete opposition to Adolf Hitler, his speeches and radio broadcasts were instrumental in motivating British resistance.Until the triumph over Nazi Germany, he was in charge of Britain as its Prime Minister.Following the Conservative Party\'s defeat in the 1945 election, he was appointed as the Leader of the Opposition to the Labour Government.He publicly warned of a potential Soviet influence behind the Iron Curtain and advocated for European solidarity.Churchill\'s return as Prime Minister was a result of his victory in the 1951 election.The Malayan Emergency, Mau Mau Uprising, Korean War, and a UK-backed coup d\'état in Iran were among the foreign affairs that took center stage during his second term.His government placed significant emphasis on house-building within the country.After suffering a serious stroke in 1953, Churchill retired as Prime Minister on 29 March 1955, but he continued to hold onto his membership of Parliament until 1964.Elizabeth II granted her son a state funeral after his death at the age of ninety in 1965, which was one of the most significant gatherings of world statesmen in history.Churchill is widely regarded as one of the most influential individuals in British history, having been named the Greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll and consistently receiving high scores in opinion polls for Prime Ministers.Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, like his father, was born into a noble family of the Dukes of Marlborough and used the surname "Chursty" when he was in public.When George Spencer was named Duke of Marlborough in 1817, he changed his surname to Spencer-Churchill to emphasize his lineage from John Churchill, the 1st Duke.The politician Lord Randolph Churchill, who was the third son of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, played a significant role in shaping Churchil\'s life;']], [[454, 'who became bbc radio one breakfast show presenter in june 1973?', 'The British Broadcasting Corporation operates BBC Radio 1 in the UK, which broadcasts worldwide and plays a range of popular songs including current hits and chart-topping tracks.Radio 1 airs alternative genres like electronic dance, hip hop, rock, indie, or interviews after 7:00 pm.The audience for this show is mainly composed of individuals aged 15-29, even though the typical age in the UK was 33 in 2008.On 1 May 1991, BBC Radio 1 commenced airing for 24 hours.Radio 1 was established in 1967 as a successor to the BBC Light Programme, which had been broadcasting popular music and entertainment since 1945. It was later replaced by History First, followed by BBC Radio 2.Radio 1 was created as a response to the widespread broadcasting of offshore pirate radio stations like Radio Caroline and Radio London, which were prohibited by Act of Parliament.The launch of Radio 1 took place on Saturday 30 September 1967 at 7:00 am.The new station featured Tony Blackburn as the first disc jockey, and his energetic style, which was first seen on Radio Caroline and Radio London, secured him a prime slot on the "Radio 1 Breakfast Show."The Controller of Radios 1 and 2 Robin Scott recorded a countdown and jingle at PAMS in Dallas, Texas, before the first words on Radio 1 were  The voice of "Radio 1" began.The.The.Good morning, everyone.The new and exciting Radio 1 sound is here.The use of US-style jingles on BBC radio was not new, but it was well-known to listeners who had prior knowledge of Blackburn and other DJs from their time on pirate radio.The first complete album to be played on Radio 1 was  Flowers in the Rain\'s by The Move.The Bee Gees\' second offering was  Massachusetts.The Radio 1 breakfast show continues to hold the most valuable slot in the schedule, with any change in their presenter generating significant media interest.John Peel and a group of individuals, including pirates hired by the British government, were among the initial staff roster. They included Keith Skues, Ed Stewart, Mike Raven, David Ryder, Jim Fisher, Jimmy Young, Dave Cash, Kenny Everetten, Simon Dee, Terry Wogan, Duncan Johnson, Doug Crawford, Tommy Vance, Chris Denning, Emperor Rosko, Pete Murray, and Bob Holness.Simon Dee and other renowned pirate radio hosts were restricted to one hour per week during their exclusive Midday Spin program.The first female DJ in Britain, Annie Nightingale, served as the longest serving presenter and constantly evolved her musical preferences with the passing of time.The station\'s early success in the 1970s was initially met with disapproval from some of its target audience, who reportedly disliked the shared airtime with Radio 2, and it was less clearly targeted at a young demographic than the offshore stations. Some DJs, such as Jimmy Young, were in their 40s.Some individuals were turned off by the fact that it was a member of an institution like the BBC, and needle time limitations prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations.The station\'s finances were limited, partly because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to finance it, and it frequently suffered disproportionately when financial cutbacks were necessary, which reinforced the perception of it being a lower priority among senior BBC executives.In spite of this, it attracted significant audiences and became the world\'s most-listened to station, with some of its shows reaching audiences of over 10 million.The Publicity Department\'s high-profile work during the early-mid-1970s led to Radio 1 presenters rarely being featured in British tabloids.']], [[455, "in the original television series of 'star trek' (not the pilot edition) who played the part of 'scottie'?", "Gene Roddenberry was the creator of Star Trek,

video emerged of the English cricket captain and umpire banging their fingers in each other\'s faces.The second day of the test saw an incident where Gatting, thought to have altered the fielding positions while Hemmings was bowling, which Rana later stopped and charged him with cheating.Rana had already caused offense to the English by wearing a Pakistani sweater and placing Mudassar Nazar\'s

virus spread by fleas was deliberately introduced into australia to control rabbits in 1951?', "An introduced species is a creature that has moved beyond its native range due to human activity, whether intentionally or unintentionally.The presence of non-indigenous species can have diverse consequences for the local ecosystem.Introduced species that have established themselves and spread beyond their original habitat are classified as invasive species.Certain substances have an adverse impact on a nearby ecosystem.There may be no significant impact or damage caused by the introduction of certain species.Several species have been deliberately introduced to combat pests.Biocontrols can serve as a beneficial substitute for pesticides in agriculture.The long-term benefits and drawbacks of each are uncertain in certain situations.A separate article provides a list of introduced species.Scientists, governments, and farmers have all given significant attention to the effects of introduced species on natural environments.The terminology of introduced species is in a state of flux due to various reasons.Introduced species can be categorized as either acclimatized, adventive, naturalized or immigrant, but they are only included in introduced categories when the species has established itself and been able to reproduce without human interference.The term invasive species is reserved for species that have developed and spread beyond their original habitat.In practical usage, this term is reserved for invasive species that cause harm.The most commonly used definition of an introduced species is the same as non-native, and it also applies to most garden and farm organisms.The basic definition mentioned earlier is well-suited for these.Some sources supplement the basic definition of  and are now living in the wild, as stated by Carlton and James T.The year is 2002.Introduced Species in the U.S.The coastal waters.The Pew Oceans Commission.All species that were raised or cultivated in gardens or farms and cannot be sustained without human supervision are no longer considered introduced.The latter are classified as either ornamental or cultivated plants in this case.Although not entirely ecologically sophisticated, the EPA's definition of introduced species is more typical. This term refers to any species that has been introduced into a region or area without proper planning.Also known as an exotic or non-indigenous species.Only the introduction of a species outside its native range can be classified as an  introduced species, which means that it may only occur in cultivation, domestication, or captivity, while others are established outside their native scope and reproduce without human intervention.Naturalized, established, and wild non-native species are all examples of naturalized species.If they extend beyond their original introduction, they are deemed invasive.In the realm of plants, the progression from introduction to establishment and invasion has been described.Essentially, introduced species are considered as non-native species.Introduced species that cause harm to the environment, human health, or other valuable resources are known as invasive species.Scientists have recommended that a species should be classified as invasive solely based on its spread and reproduction, rather than any potential harm.According to practical definitions, an invasive species is one that has been introduced and become a nuisance in its new habitat by spreading it through natural means.The term is employed to convey both a sense of urgency and actual or potential harm.As an illustration, U.S.The definition of invasive species in Executive Order 13112 ( 1999) is an alien species that may cause health or economic harm to humans.The biological definition of invasive species does not include the potential to cause harm, but rather highlights

during play, and only in their penalty area.While the main method of striking or passing the ball is with the feet, other players may also use their head or torso.The team that scores the maximum number of goals by the end of the match is declared the winner.If the score is tied at the end of the game, the competition format determines whether a draw is declared or extra time is required to

oldest form of football that originated in China.The Cuju team had the ability to use any physical move, except for hands, and the goal was to kick a ball into the net.Despite similarities to rugby,

England, dating back to at least the eighth century AD.The Cambridge Rules, which were first formulated at Cambridge University in 1848, had a significant impact on the development of future regulations, such as association football.A meeting was held at Trinity College in Cambridge, attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester, and Shrewsbury schools, where the Cambridge Rules were written.They were not universally embraced.During the 1850s, numerous clubs that were not associated with schools or universities were established across the English-speaking

music is characterized by a hollow oval note head, such as the minim of 0.135 degrees (as seen in Figure 1, which has no stem and only 0.238-kHz, making it equivalent to British or American whole notes).Four beats in 4/4 time, also known as the entire measure or bar, is equivalent to its length.The majority of notes are composed of individual parts.The length of half-note playing is equivalent to the duration of the entire note, while quarter notes are played for one quarter of their time.A whole note is half the length of a double whole or semibreve, and the shorter note (minimum) is twice its original length.The symbol was first encountered in music notation during the late thirteenth century.The whole rest or semibreve rest is a symbol that corresponds to the same amount of silence.Generally, the complete rests are drawn as filled-in rectangles that hang under the second line from the top of a musical staff, but they may be placed under another line in more intricate passages, such as when two instruments or vocalists appear on one staff while one is temporarily silent.In music that utilizes the full length of a note and rest, like Anglican chant, it is acceptable to use this length regardless of the time of day.This is a versatile approach that can be applied in almost all music genres.The British name is derived from the semibrevis of mensural notation, which forms the basis of the entire note\'s grammatical structure.The American name is a derivative of the German ganze Note.The modern form, as opposed to the double whole note or shorter values with

1988.The total number of episodes was 39, with the exception of two that lasted only half an hour.BBC Radio received adaptations for several episodes, while a stage play was produced in 2010, and the new TV show was launched on UKTV Gold in 2013.The fictional Department of Administrative Affairs in Whitehall, played by Paul Eddington, serves as the central location for Yes Minister, which follows the minister's career.The British Civil Service is against his numerous attempts to create laws and make departmental changes, with Sir Humphrey Appleby, the Permanent Secretary played by Sir Nigel Hawthorne, being one of them.The Principal Private Secretary, Derek Fowlds, who plays Bernard Woolley, is usually in a state of separation from him.The sequel, titled Yes, Prime Minister, continued the cast from its predecessor and followed the path of Jim Hacker's initial elevation to Number 10, which was only revealed after the previous Prime minister stepped down.The series was awarded several accolades, including BAFTA and ranked sixth in the Britain's Best Sitcom poll in 2004.Margaret Thatcher, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time, held it in high regard as her preferred television show.The series commences after the opposition party, led by Jim Hacker MP, has won against the current government in a general election.There is no indication of his political party affiliation and his party symbol is not clearly Conservative or Labour-identified.Hacker is offered the position of Minister of Administrative Affairs by the Prime Minister, which he accepts.During his visit to his department, Hacker meets with Sir Humphrey Appleby, the Permanent Secretary, and Bernard Woolley, who is the Principal Private Secretary.Although Appleby appears to be showing disrespect towards the new minister, he is willing to sacrifice his integrity in order to maintain the current state.Despite Woolley's empathy for Hacker, Appleby cautions that his civil servant superiors will have a significant impact on his future career, as ministers typically do not stay in one department for long periods.In many episodes, the emphasis is on proposals supported by Hacker that are thwarted by Appleby, while in others, both companies present proposals that were rejected by hackers but still encouraged by them.Sometimes, they collaborate to achieve a shared objective, such as preventing the dissolution of their department or handling diplomatic issues.The central government's operations are the primary focus of the series, with most scenes taking place in private settings like offices or exclusive clubs.According to Lynn, the House of Commons was not utilized as a theater because government is present there.There is a significant amount of theatre and political maneuvering.The government operates in a private setting.The authentic work, like all public performances, is executed in rehearsal and not outside the venue.The government's desired outcomes are presented to the public and the House.In spite of that, The Compassionate Society episode includes an audio recording of Yesterday in Parliament where Hacker speaks in the House of Commons and other episodes featuring scenes in a Committee room and the Foreign Secretary's office.It was not uncommon for a British audience to not watch any scenes from the House of Commons during the series' production, given that television cameras were not permitted in this location and the Lords had only recently moved into the house.Characters' differentiation is often distinguished by their contrasting ideals and selfish motives.While Hacker may approach issues with a sense of idealism and the desire to improve, he ultimately considers his re-election and promotion to higher office as the primary indicators of success.Therefore, he must be noticeable to the voters and demonstrate responsiveness to their demands."]], [[461, "which british tv series starring john simm as dci sam

were employed, with Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa being particularly prominent.The United Kingdom\'s regions and nations had varying pronunciations of three pence as a sum.The coin was commonly referred to as a "bit" or "coin" in everyday language.One pound sterling was equivalent to two hundred and forty pence before the arrival of Decimal Day in 1971.A shilling was equivalent to a pound, while ten pence equaled up to two shingles.Shillings and pence were the usual currency units for amounts less than a pound.g.Three shillings and six pence ( 3/6 ) are equivalent to the value of forty-two.Values below a shilling were expressed in pence.g.The equivalent of eight pence is 8 dollars.The three-pences coin, which was originally known as  3d\', was introduced in England during King Edward VI\'s reign and became one of several new denominations.Despite its simplicity under the old sterling coinage system, the groat of four pence was not well-received initially due to its popularity.As a result, the coin was not produced during the next two reigns.At the London and York mints, threepences were struck by Edward VI.A rose is visible on the left side of the obverse depiction of his front bust, with the legend surrounding the numeral III.The reverse displays a lengthy cross on the royal shield, bordered by the words "London mint" (I have made God my helper) or "York mint") ( City of York).During her reign from 1558 to 1557, Queen Elizabeth I produced threepences during her third coinage in 1561-1577.The majority of the 1561 periodicals have a diameter of 21 mm, while the smaller ones are 19 m.The obverse display of these coins features the queen\'s head on the front and the date on their back, which sets them apart from other coins.The queen\'s crowned

In 1922, Ireland was divided between the newly established Irish Free State and the northeast, which chose to remain part of the United Kingdom as Northern Ireland.To reflect the change in the state\'s boundaries, the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 changed the name of the UK Parliament to the Parliament of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Between 1801 and 1837, the Kingdom of Ireland was a settler state that belonged to Great Britain and Ireland.The sovereign was the current ruler of England and later over Great Britain.Under the leadership of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the government was managed by the monarch.He received support from the Chief Secretary of Ireland.The responsibility for their actions was given to the government in London, not the Parliament of Ireland.The Irish parliament was subject to severe limitations before the Constitution of 1782, and decisions made in Irish courts were susceptible to overturning on appeal to the British House of Lords in London.Henry Grattan played a role in Ireland\'s partial independence during the 1780s.The Penal Laws had a lessened impact on the majority Roman Catholic population and the dissenting minority, with some property-owning Catholics being granted the franchise in 1794.Nevertheless, they were not permitted to sit in the Irish House of Commons.The British war against revolutionary France resulted in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which brought an end to their brief period of independence.The British government was apprehensive about an independent Ireland aligning with the French, which led to the decision to unify the two nations.The parliaments of both kingdoms passed laws, which resulted in this being implemented on 1 January 1801.The British had led the Irish to believe that their loss of legislative independence would be compensated by Catholic Emancipation.e.Civil disabilities were abolished for Roman Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland.King George III strongly opposed the idea of emancipation and was able to defeat his government\'s efforts to introduce it.During the War of the Second Coalition (1799-1801), Britain took over most of French and Dutch overseas territories, with the Netherlands becoming a satellite state of France in 1796.

This prompted critics to discuss what they called "new realism."Ilja Stogoff, Zakhar Prilepin, Alexander Karasyov, Arkadi Babchenko, Vladimir Lorchenkov, Alexandr Snegiryonov, and Sergej Shargunov are among the leading contemporary realists.Nearly all genres of known literature were enriched by the contributions of Russian writers.Russia has awarded five Nobel Prizes in literature.The fourth largest book publisher in the world as of 2011 was Russia.Russians are reputed to be the most avid readers in the world, as per a popular folk saying.The dissolution of mass illiteracy in the first half of the 20th century led to Russians being proudly considered as the most reading nation globally, where they still consider literature to be important for them.Early history has produced many works of art in the Old Russian language, known as masterpieces.e.The Rus\' language is distinct from the contemporaneous Church Slavonic and modern Russian.The primary category of Old Russian historical literature consisted of chronicles, with the majority being anonymous.The Tale of Igor\'s Campaign and Praying of Daniel the Immured are two other works by anonymous authors.Old Russian literature was characterized by the popularization of hagiographies, also known as zhitiya svyatykh or the "life and death" of saints.']], [[466, 'in what card game do you need the queen of spades to shoot the moon?', 'In a standard deck, the queen of the suit of spades (Q) is one of 52 playing cards.The queen of spades is often regarded as an unlucky card in Hearts, regardless of the role or game.The player who wins the queen of spades receives 13 points in a game where they are not allowed to win any points.The player who receives the card with all 13 hearts will not be awarded any points, as they may have shot the moon and received 26 points compared to their opponents.Although any card is technically acceptable, the queen of spades is traditionally used as a card that cannot be substituted, making it the "old maid" card.Cartomancy suggests that the queen of spades is a sign of intelligence.It embodies practicality, logic, and intellect in decision-making.It signifies a woman who is imaginative and makes her plans in advance.']], [[467, "revealed in the author's archives given to oxford's bodelian library in 2008, what occupationally titled novel had the working name the reluctant autumn of george smiley?", "George Smiley was a fictional character created by John le Carré.Smiley is employed by The Circus, the British intelligence agency that operates overseas.The novels of Call for the Dead, A Murder of Quality and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, as well as The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People, feature him as a central character, and are followed by his role in The Spying Who Came in from the Cold, The Looking Glass War and The Secret Pilgrim.Smiley's early life is not well-defined, except for a brief introduction in Call for the Dead, but le Carré does provide some information in his novels.Probably around 1906 or 1915, Smiley was born to middle-class parents in the South of England. He attended a small public school and an outdated Oxford college, and pursued his studies in modern languages, with primarily Baroque German literature.He was enlisted into the Circus in July 1928, while his tutor Jebedee was contemplating post-graduate studies in that area.During his time in Germany, he worked as a lecturer and recruited networks undercover while receiving training and probation in Central Europe and South America.With the start of World War II in 1939, he was serving in both Germany and Switzerland and Sweden.Smiley's wartime bosses characterized him as possessing the dexterity of Satan and the religious convictions of a virgin.He was called back to England in 1943 to work at the Circus headquarters and later in 1945, he proposed to Lady Ann Sercomb, who was a beautiful, impeccably dressed secretary.Ann would be a highly manipulative and unfaithful partner.In the same year, Smiley resigned from the Service and returned to Oxford.Smiley was asked to come back to the Service in 1947, during the Cold War, and he took up counter-intelligence work in early 1951, staying there for the next decade.Karla, Smiley's Soviet adversary, was first encountered by him in a Delhi prison during that time.Karla was unable to crack the glass, so she took advantage of having Smiley's lighter with her as a gift from his wife Ann.The first novel by le Carré, Call for the Dead, featured Smiley in its early novels.At the onset of the novel's story, in the early 1960s, Smiley has become disheartened and is employed in a basic intelligence position, which involves cleaning security personnel.Throughout the story, he mourns the absence of his skilled agents mentored by him and their replacement by less skilled civil service officials like Maston, who refers to himself as the Minister of Intelligence's self-proclaimed Adviser, while being secretly ridiculed.In the course of the story, Smiley resigned from the Circus in frustration and resolved to unify an East German spy network, ultimately recovering his reputation while remaining in retirement at the end, despite Maston's pleas.A Murder of Quality, le Carré's next novel, prompts him to investigate a murder at eponymous public school while pursuing an informal life of German literature at one of the West Country universities, possibly Exeter.Le Carré's third novel, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, propelled him to international fame.Although Smiley, a minor but significant character in the story, has retired, it was disclosed that she is now back in charge of helping Maston, who had been appointed as the Circus' chief.Smiley and his assistant Peter Guillam have converted the brutal East German intelligence chief into a British double agent.This book documents the events that took place in 1962, following the building of the Berlin Wall."]], [[468, 'which country, a member state of the ec, is noted for the production of the rich dessert wine commandaria?', 'Venice, ;The capital

fighter, the meteor was made by which company?", 'A fighter plane is a military aircraft that is designed for air-to-air combat against other aircraft, rather than bombers or attack planes, and its primary function is to strike targets on the ground.The characteristics of a fighter include its speed, maneuverability, and small size in comparison to other combat aircraft.Many fighters are equipped with secondary ground-attack capabilities, and a few are dual-roled fighter-bombers;Fighters are frequently referred to as aircraft that do not meet the standard definition.This could be for political or national security reasons, advertising purposes, or other reasons.A fighter\'s primary aim is to establish air dominance over a battlefield.The achievement and maintenance of air superiority have been deemed crucial for winning in conventional warfare since World War I.Success or failure of a belligerent\'s air superiority strategy is dependent on several factors, including the proficiency of their pilots, the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying fighters and the numbers and performance of those fighter jets.Airborne combat forces have been actively engaged in developing and deploying advanced fighters since the advent of aerial warfare, as air superiority is crucial for their survival. Additionally, maintaining a viable fighter fleet consumes surprisingly large portions of modern defense budgets.The official term for such aircraft was not used until after World War I, when the word "carriage" was introduced.The British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force referred to these planes as scouts until the early 1920s.The U.S.S.The Army named their fighters as pursuit aircraft from 1916 until the late 1940s.In the majority of languages, fighter aircraft and hunting aircraft are referred to as hunter or hunters.)Exceptions exist in both Russian and Hebrew.A letter or number is commonly used in military nomenclature to identify different types of aircraft, along with a number to indicate their specific type.The designation of a fighter by letter varies across nations, with

multipurpose fighter-bombers, strike fighters, and smaller tactical ground-attack planes.The Sopwith Camel and other fighting scouts of World War I have consistently performed ground-attack work, as demonstrated.In World War II, the USAAF and RAF frequently relied on fighters instead of dedicated light bombers or dive bombERS, with aircraft like the P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Hurricane being replaced to ground attack.The F-111 and F-11 aircraft are among the fighters that have been designated, but they were not yet considered for combat due to political or other reasons.The F-111B was initially developed as a fighter aircraft for use with the U.S.The Navy\'s plans were abandoned.The blurring is a continuation of the use of fighters in their initial deployment for  attack or\'strike\' operations against ground targets using strafing, small bombs, and incendiaries.A variety of specialized aircraft types is more expensive than versatile fighter-bombers like the F/A-18 Hornet.The US F-14 Tomcat, F-15 Eagle, the F-22 Raptor, and Russian Su-27 are examples of expensive fighter aircraft that were used as all-weather interceptors and air superiority fighter planes, often evolving into air-to-ground roles at a later stage in their careers.An interceptor aircraft is usually designed to target bombers and frequently sacrifices its maneuverability for its climb rate.The development of fighters during World War I aimed to prevent enemy aircraft and dirigibles from gathering intelligence through reconnaissance.']], [[470, 'by what first name is the wife of

gained popularity among young people due to his short stature (5\' 1 \'\' or 155 cm), curly red hair and love for slapstick, which made him a nationally recognized comedian.The catchphrase "."Charles Edward Springall was born in his youth at the Elephant and Castle in Southwark, South London, and later gained success as a comedian after earning his mother\'s maiden name.After leaving school, Drake

appearance in the 1954 movie, Fast and Loose.Known for his iconic phrase "Hi, my friends!" during the early stages of his career, he was also featured in The Late Show and The Charlie Drake Show.The catchphrase was derived from his short stature, which meant that his eyes would often be directly at a woman\'s breast.Because of this and his preference for appearing with overweight women in his TV shows, the catchphrase was coined.A serious accident that occurred during a live broadcast in 1961 brought an end to the later series.During his slapstick sketch, Drake had planned to position a bookcase so fragile that it would collapse.It was later revealed that a diligent worker had repaired the bookcase before the broadcast.The actors who were working with him, unaware of the situation, proceeded to pick him up and throw him through an open window for the remainder of their sketch.Drake sustained a skull fracture and was unconscious for three days.Two years passed before he made a comeback to the screen.Sands of the Desert (Summer, 1960), Petticoat Pirates (May, 1961), The Cracksman (October, 1963), and Mister Ten Per Cent (December, 1967) were all successful films that emerged from television fame, but none of them were successful.The Charlie Drake Show, which won an award at the Montreux Festival in 1968, marked his return to television in 1963.The main focus of this was a lengthy drawing that depicted an orchestra playing the 1812 Overture, with Drake seemingly handling all instruments;He was involved in a triangle match where he played and failed to pick up the ball before landing it.The series featured him as a gymnast performing one arm twist in revolving arms from an elevated position, with commentary that would eventually reach thousands. At the end of the show, Drake\'s entire arm became apparent to be 20 ft long.Although there were shows like Who is Sylvia (67) and Slapstick and Old Lace (71), The Worker (65-70) was the most laudable.This Is Your Life featured him twice, in December 1961 and November 1995, when he was unexpectedly confronted by Eamonn Andrews in a rehearsal room at the London Palladium and Michael Aspel during the comedy play Funny Money at The Playhouse Theatre.In ATV/ITV\'s The Worker In The Works (from 1965 to 1970), he played the character of an unemployed laborer who was dispatched to a new job by irritated clerks, including Mr Whitaker and Henry McGee.']], [[473, 'which country is currently ruled by the chakri dynasty that has been in power since 1782?', 'The Chakri Dynasty ;.http: //www.For example: forvo.Thailand\'s King and royal family are the two houses that currently rule the Kingdom of Thailand.The Rattanakosin Era, which began in 1782 after King Taksin of Thonburi\'s reign ended, has been under the rule of the dynasty in Thailand.The establishment of the royal house was attributed to King Rama I, who was an Ayutthayan military leader with Sino-Mon heritage.Before the dynasty\'s establishment, King Rama I held the title of Chakri, which was used to address his superior as the civil chancellor.

decade and was elected Labour Party leader in July 1994, shortly after the untimely death of his predecessor, John Smith.During Blair\'s tenure, the party used the term "New Labour" to distinguish itself from past Labour policies and the conventional understanding of socialism.Blair endorsed a novel notion that he called social-ism, which involves political principles that acknowledge the interdependence of people and advocate for social justice, cohesion, equal value to all citizens, and equal opportunities.Blair was criticized by his opponents for compelling the Labour Party to abandon true socialism and embrace capitalism.The Labour Party achieved the biggest general election victory in its history in May 1997, resulting in Blair becoming the youngest Prime Minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812.Blair\'s personal popularity was at its peak in September 1997, when his public reaction to the death of Princess Diana resulted in a 93% public approval rating.Under his leadership, the Labour Party won two additional elections: in 2001, where it achieved another resounding victory, and in 2005, when its majority was reduced.The introduction of the National Minimum Wage Act, Human Rights Act and Freedom of Information Act occurred during the early years of Blair\'s New Labour government.By implementing four of the promises in its 1997 manifesto, Blair\'s government also carried out devolution, established the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales, and sorted out the Northern Ireland Assembly.Blair was involved in the 1998 Good Friday

waging an offensive.The Iraq Inquiry heavily criticized his actions in 2016 and labeled the invasion of Iraq as unnecessary and unwarranted.The Labour Party replaced Blair as leader on 24 June 2007, and Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007.Until 27 May 2015, Blair was the official Envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East, having stepped down as Prime Minister on that day.He is

However, it was doubtful that he would have any more offspring.The inheritance of territories under Salic law was restricted to males, but George and his brothers could now inherit the territories of their father and uncle.In 1682, the family consented to primogeniture, which meant that George would inherit all the territory without sharing it with his siblings.George and Sophia Dorothea of Celle exchanged vows in the same year, which enabled them to amass additional riches that were not subject to Salic laws.The marriage of state was arranged mainly to ensure a sound annual income and aid in the eventual unification of Hanover and Celle.Initially, his mother objected to the marriage because she had an unfavorable opinion of Sophia Dorothea's mother, who was not a member of the royal family, and because it worried her legitimate status.The marriage's advantages eventually won her favor."]], [[477, 'which manchester born physicist won the nobel prize for physics in 1906 and is

It was later replaced by History First, followed by BBC Radio 2.Radio 1 was created as a response to the widespread broadcasting of offshore pirate radio stations like Radio Caroline and Radio London, which were prohibited by Act of Parliament.The launch of Radio 1 took place on Saturday 30 September 1967 at 7:00 am.The new station featured Tony Blackburn as the first disc jockey, and his energetic style, which was first seen on Radio Caroline and Radio London, secured him a prime slot on the "Radio 1 Breakfast Show."The Controller of Radios 1 and 2 Robin Scott recorded a countdown and jingle at PAMS in Dallas, Texas, before the first words on Radio 1 were  The voice of "Radio 1" began.The.The.Good morning, everyone.The new and exciting Radio 1 sound is here.The use of US-style jingles on BBC radio was not new, but it was well-known to listeners who had prior knowledge of Blackburn and other DJs from their time on pirate radio.The first complete album to be played on Radio 1 was  Flowers in the Rain\'s by The Move.The Bee Gees\' second offering was  Massachusetts.The Radio 1 breakfast show continues to hold the most valuable slot in the schedule, with any change in their presenter generating significant media interest.John Peel and a group of individuals, including pirates hired by the British government, were among the initial staff roster.

Some DJs, such as Jimmy Young, were in their 40s.Some individuals were turned off by the fact that it was a member of an institution like the BBC, and needle time limitations prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations.The station\'s finances were limited, partly because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to finance it, and it frequently suffered disproportionately when financial cutbacks were necessary, which reinforced the perception of it being a lower priority among senior BBC executives.In spite of this, it attracted significant audiences and became the world\'s most-listened to station, with some of its shows reaching audiences of over 10 million.The Publicity Department\'s high-profile work during the early-mid-1970s led to Radio 1 presenters rarely being featured in British tabloids.']], [[483, 'in which charles dickens novel does the character mr m choakumchild appear?', 'Charles John Huffam Dickens (;An English writer and social critic, he lived between 7 February 1812 and 9 June 1870.He is considered the greatest novelist of the Victorian era, having created some of history\'s most famous fictional characters.The.His literary works were widely acclaimed during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century, both critics and scholars had come to view him as a literary genius.His novels and short stories continue to be widely read.After his father\'s imprisonment in a debtors\' prison, Dickens left school to work in the factory, having been born in Portsmouth.Despite his lack of formal education, he maintained a weekly journal for two decades, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, gave numerous lectures and performances, was an unyielding letter writer, and advocated strongly for children\'s rights, education reforms.The Pickwick Papers, published in 1836, marked the beginning of Dickens\'s literary success.His international literary renown was established in a matter of years, thanks to his humorous humor, satire, and keen understanding of character traits as well as the structure of society.Serial publication of narrative fiction, the dominant form of novel publishing in the Victorian period, was a result of his novels, which were typically published in installments of monthly or weekly increments.Through the use of the instalment format, Dickens was able to gauge his audience\'s reaction and frequently adjusted his plot and character development.Dickens improved the character of Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield by including positive traits after her chiropodist expressed distress about her disability.He meticulously crafted his narratives, and frequently integrated elements from everyday events into the plot.Through the use of ha\'pennies donated by a significant number of illiterate poor, each new monthly episode was read to an expanding audience.The literary colossal of his generation was how Dickens was seen.A Christmas Carol, his novella from 1843, continues to be popular and inspires new adaptations in all artistic genres.Many of his novels, including Oliver Twist and Great Expectations, are adaption-style and evoke the atmosphere of early Victorian London.A Tale of Two Cities, a historical fiction written by him, is his most well-known novel, set in London and Paris in 1859.Dickens\' creative brilliance has been praised by fellow writers, including Leo Tolstoy, George Orwell, and G.K.The qualities of Chesterton include its authenticity, comedic value, prose writing style, unique characterisations, and social critique.In contrast, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of psychological depth, loose writing, or saccharine sentimentalism.The word "Dickensian" is used to describe something that bears resemblance to Dickens and his writings, such as unfavorable living conditions or characters who are humorously unpleasant.Born on February 7, 1812, at 1 Mile End Terrace, which is now 393 Commercial Road, in Landport, Portsea Island, Portsmouth.

However, it was later invaded by Soviet Russia in 1921 and subsequently absorbed into the Soviet Union as the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic.After regaining independence in 1991, Georgia experienced civil and economic turmoil for most of the 1990s.Georgia maintained its strong pro-Western foreign policy and implemented a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at NATO and European integration during the peaceful Rose Revolution, which marked the end of this period.The country\'s Western orientation caused the relationship with Russia to deteriorate, leading to the short-lived Russo-Georgian War.The Council of Europe and the GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development have Georgia as one of their membership.Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which gained little international recognition after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, are included in it as de facto independent regions.The areas are considered part of Georgia\'s sovereign territory by Georgia

a sting by a nettle or an ant?', 'The Hymenoptera order includes ants, wasps, and bees as members of the eusocial group known as Formicidae.Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period around 99 million years ago and diversified after the growth of flowering plants.Out of the 22,000 species estimated to exist, more than 12,500 have been classified.With their elbowed antennae and distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists, they are easily identifiable.The size of an ant colony can vary from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organized colonies that may be made up of millions of individuals and occupy large territories.The larger colonies are primarily made up of sterile, wingless females that form castes such as workers, soldiers, or other specialized groups.Ant colonies are typically characterized by the presence of both male and female reproductively fertile creatures, known as "dronges" or queens.The ants in colonies are classified as superorganisms due to their ability to function as a cohesive unit, providing support for the colony.Virtually every landmass on Earth has been colonized by ants.Antarctica and certain remote or inhospitable islands are the only areas without indigenous ants.In most ecosystems, ants are present and can account for 15-250 percent of the animal biomass on land.Due to their social organization and ability to modify habitats, access resources, and protect themselves, they have been successful in various environments.Their long-term co-evolution with other species has resulted in the development of mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.Hölldobler and Wilson (in 1990) p.Work division, interpersonal communication, and problem-solving skills are common traits of the ant societies.The similarities with human societies have been a source of inspiration and research for countless years.Ants are present in various human cultures, utilized in cooking, medicine, and ritual practices.Certain species are deemed valuable as biological pest control agents.The resource-seeking abilities of ants can lead to conflicts with humans, as they can damage crops and infest buildings.The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is an example of a species that has been declared invasive, having established themselves in areas where they were not intentionally introduced.The word  ant \'\' is derived from Middle English, which are based on Old English and are related to dialectal Dutch and Old High German, leading to the creation of modern German.These words all have their roots in West Germanic * and were first interpreted as representing the character "biter" (from Proto-Germanic*,  off, away \'\' + LatinOT)The \'\'

Hymenoptera order includes the taxonomic group Formicidae, which comprises sawflies, bees, and wasps.According to a 2013 study, the aculeate wasps are the ancestral home of ants, which are believed to be related to the nearby Apoidea.The year 1966 saw E.O.An ant (Sphecomyrma) that lived in the Cretaceous period was identified by Wilson and his colleagues through fossil evidence.The specimen, which

HaidomyRmex and Haidomialobos, related genera in subfae of the Speciformes family, are now considered to be capable of being present as arboreal predators.99 million year old amber from Myanmar has been found to contain older ants belonging to the Sphecomyrmodes genus.Around 60 million years ago, the flowering plants diversified and took over as the dominant ecological group after their growth around 100 million year ago.The Leptanillinae and Martialinae groups, along with other related ones, are believed to have evolved from primitive ants that were likely underground predators.']], [[486,

road racing and street bikes, or motocross and dirt bikes.The range of street bikes includes cruisers, sportbikes like BMX machines, scooters and mopeds.Most off-road motorcycles are not permitted on the streets of certain regions, but they are specifically designed for racing classes that specialize in dirt bikes like motocross.Dual-sport machines, for instance, are designed to be used both off-road and on the road, with added features that make them both legal and comfortable.Each design creates a unique riding posture, with each configuration providing either specialized benefit or extensive potential.The Daimler Reitwagen, a petroleum-fueled motorcycle, was the first experimentation and invention in internal combustion.In 1885, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, German inventors, designed and constructed the structure in Bad Cannstatt, Germany.This vehicle was distinct from the safety bicycles and boneshaker bicycle of the time due to its lack of steering axis angle and fork offset, which meant that it did not follow the dynamics of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics that had been developed almost 70 years earlier.To maintain its position while turning, it required two outrigger wheels.The Reitwagen, which was a type of riding vehicle, was named after the inventors.Instead of a genuine prototype vehicle, it was designed as an expeditious testbed for their new engine.The Butler Petrol Cycle, a self-propelled cycle, was the first commercial design to be developed in England by Edward Butler in 1884.The Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1884 was where he showcased his designs for the vehicle.In 1888, the Merryweather Fire Engine company in Greenwich constructed the vehicle.A rear-wheel drive mechanism powered by a 600 cc motor, 5/8hp ( 466W), was used

in 2016 to honor the football player from Madeira.In the past, the airport was known for its short runway, which, combined with the backdrop of mountains and the ocean, made landing difficult even for experienced pilots.The Innovative Solution won Funchal the Outstanding Structure Award from the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering in 2004, which recognizes the most exceptional, creative or stimulating structure completed in recent years.Despite this, it remains one of the most peculiar and hazardous airports globally.On 18 July 1964, the History Madeira Airport was inaugurated, featuring two 1600 m runways.A TAP Air Portugal Lockheed Constellation was the first aircraft to land, carrying 80 passengers.Due to the popularity of Madeira tourism in 1972, the runway had to be expanded to accommodate modern and larger planes.The Kai Tak of Europe was characterized by its unique approach to runway 05, leading to the decision to extend the existing runway instead of building one.In 1973, a new terminal was constructed at the airport to accommodate 500,000 passengers.During the years 1982 to 1986, Madeira's runway was extended by 200 meters and eventually expanded to 1800 meters, with four gates being opened.Despite being only 1600 m long, the runway was extended by 200 mm 8 years after the TAP Portugal Flight 425 crash in 1977.The runway was almost doubled in size when it was extended again in 2000, to a length of 2781 m.The extension was constructed on a platform that was partly above the ocean and supported by 180 columns, each about 70 meters tall, as landfill was not feasible.Andrade Gutierrez, a Brazilian construction firm, oversaw the extension of Madeira Airport, which is considered one of the most challenging projects due to its challenging terrain and orography.On 6 October 2002, the new runway and terminal were opened, and an Air-Atlantic Iceland Boeing 747-267B with TF-ABA registration made an official landing at the airport to commemorate the occasion.Although uncommon, certain flights operated by TAP Portugal make regular stops in Madeira with A330-200 aircraft on the Lisbon-Caracas-Lisbon route.The year

commonly referred to.Despite their differences, Roman historiographical forms are distinct from Greek ones and express highly Roman concerns.Unlike the Greeks, Roman historiography did not begin with an oral history.The Annals of the Pontifex Maximus and their accompanying texts were a foundation for the Roman style of history.In the Annales Maximi, there is a vast assortment of information on historical events, including religious texts, the names of consuls, priest deaths, and disasters.The Annales Maximi feature the White Tablets, also known as the " Tabulae Albatada" and their contents that contain information about the republic\'s beginnings.Quintus Fabius Pictor, who is commonly recognized as the " Founder of Historiography," was responsible for the establishment of Roman historiographic history.Rome had no historiography before the second Punic war, but it was necessary afterward to honor this momentous occasion.Q.The task was undertaken by Fabius Pictor, who wrote a history of Rome in Greek rather than Latin.Writing about the war in Greek was a response to the need to address the Greeks and counter Timaeus\' historical contributions to Rome until the Second Punic War.Rome was the subject of Timaeus\' disapproval in his writing.In defense of the Roman state, Q.Fabius Pictor utilized the Olympiad dating and a Hellenistic approach when writing in Greek.Q.Fabius Pictor\'s approach to writing history, which involved advocating for the Roman state and its actions while also using propaganda, became a defining characteristic of Roman historiography.Q.The "ab urbe condita" tradition of historiography, which involves writing history from the moment he was born, is attributed to Fabius Pictor.Following Q.Lucius Cincius Alimentus, Gaius Acilius and Aulus PostumiUS Albinus were among the authors who followed in the footsteps of Fabiuse Pictor\'s writing, inspired by the new literary style.The first historian to use Latin in writing was Cato the Elder.He wrote the Origines to teach Romans about their identity and status.Similar to Q.Roman virtues are depicted in legends from the early history, while Fabius Pictor and Cato the Elder wrote ab urbe condita.The Origines noted that Rome and other Italian towns were not only venerable, but that the Romans were superior to the Greeks.Historiography gained popularity among upper class individuals who were interested in engaging in virtuous and noble activities during their Roman occupation.The Romans\' disapproval of leisure time led to the acceptance of writing history as a means of spending their retirement.As soon as historiography was introduced to Rome, it divided into two traditions: the annalistic and monographic traditions.Annalistic tradition: Authors wrote annual histories from the beginning of the city to the present day (usually before the end of one\'s life),Annalistic literature includes works by Gnaeus Gellius (c.).From Aeneas to 146 BC, he wrote his

included Alexander III of Macedon, also known as Alexander the Great, who reigned from July 356 BC to June 323 BC.In 356 BC, Alexander was born in Pella and took over the throne from his father, Philip II, at the age of twenty.His reign was characterized by an unprecedented military expedition across Asia and northeast Africa, which culminated in the establishment of one of the most extensive empires in ancient times, spanning from Greece to northwestern India at the age of thirty.He remained unbeaten in battle and is widely considered to be one of the most successful military commanders in history.Alexander received education from the philosopher Aristotle until he turned 16.Alexander took over the throne from his father, Philip, after his assassination in 336 BC, and was left with a powerful kingdom and an experienced army.Alexander was granted the generalship of Greece and utilized his father's Panhellenic initiative to guide the Greeks in conquering Persia.He launched an invasion of the Achaemenid Empire in 334 BC, governed Asia Minor, and conducted a series of campaigns that spanned 10 years.The power of Persia was torn apart by Alexander's series of decisive battles, including the ones at Issus and Gaugamela.The Persian King Darius III was overthrown by him, leading to the complete subjugation of the Achaemenid Empire.At that time, his dominion encompassed the area between the Adriatic Sea and the Indus River.He invaded India in 326 BC with the aim of reaching the polar regions and the Great Outer Sea, but was eventually forced to retreat due to the demand of his troops.In 323 BC, Alexander passed away in Babylon, the city he had planned to establish as his capital, without initiating a sequence of planned campaigns that would have started with an assault on Arabia.After his death, a series of civil wars caused the collapse of Alexander's empire, with several states being ruled by the Diadochi, who were his surviving generals and heirs.Alexander's conquests, including the spread of Greco-Buddhism, were a result of his cultural influence.Almost twenty cities were founded by him, with Alexandria in Egypt being the most prominent.Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the dissemination of their culture in the east led to the development of a new Hellenistic civilization, which was still evident in mid-15th century Byzantine traditions and widespread Greek speakers until the 1920s.As a classical hero like Achilles, Alexander has gained legendary status and is featured in the history and myths of both Greek and non-Greek cultures.His tactics were used as a benchmark by military commanders, and his methods are still being taught in military schools worldwide.Alongside his teacher Aristotle, he is frequently considered one of the most influential individuals in human history.The birth of Alexander took place on the sixth day of Hekatombaion in the ancient Greek month of Pella, which is believed to have happened around 20 July 356 BC, and the exact date of his birth is not known.His mother, Olympias the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus was his fourth wife, and Philip II was the son of him.Olympias was Philip's principal wife for a period, possibly due to her giving birth to Alexander, among his seven or eight wives.Alexander's birth and childhood are the subject of various myths.The ancient Greek biographer Plutarch claimed that Olympias had a dream about being hit by lava, which caused her womb to spread far and wide before dying.It is said that Philip dreamt about fastening a seal with the image of lion to his wife's womb, some time after the wedding.The interpretations of dreams by Plutarch included the possibility that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, as indicated by the sealing of her womb.Zeus was the father of Alexander."]], [[491, 'what hero from greek mythology was killed by a discus thrown by apollo, who then named a flower after him, made from his spilled blood?', 'The Greek term Apolln is used to refer to Apollo, which can be found in Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek;Doric, Apelln;Apeiln, Arcadocypriot;The Aeolic, Aploun;In the realm of classical Greek and Roman religion, Olympian gods are among the most crucial and intricate deities in both Greek as well as Roman mythology.The ideal of the kouros, Apollo has been linked to various deities such as music, truth, healing, and poetry.The chaste huntress Artemis is Apollo\'s twin, and he is the son of Zeus and Leto.In mythology with Greek influence, the Etruscan god Apollo is referred to as Apulu.Apollo, the oracular god and prophet of the Delphic Oracle, was worshipped as he was the patron of this deity.Apollo is connected to medicine and healing, whether through himself or his son Asclepius, but he is also considered a god who can bring about sickness and fatal epidemics.As one of the god\'s custodians, Apollo was associated with dominion over colonists and patronage of herds.The Muses had Apollo as their leader and choir director, with Apollo serving as the patron deity of music and poetry.Hermes fashioned the lyre specifically for him, and it became a customary trait of Apollo.Paeans were the name given to hymns sung in honor of Apollo.Apollo Helios, the Greek god of the sun, and his sister Artemis were linked in a similar manner to Selene, respectively, during the Hellenistic period, particularly in the 3rd century BCE.In Latin texts, Joseph Fontenrose asserted that he could not find any association between Apollo and Sol among the Augustan poets of the 1st century, including the conjurations of Aeneas and Latinus in Aentileid XII.Until the 3rd century CE, Apollo and Helios/Sol were not linked in literary and mythological works.Although the name of Apollo is not mentioned in the Linear B texts, it is thought to have originated from a possible precursor god or epithet of him.The origin of the name is ambiguous.During the common era, the Classical Attic spelling had almost taken over all other forms, but the Doric form Apellon is more archaic and was derived from a previous time.The name is probably linked to the Doric month Apellaios () and the ritual of offering apellaia ( ) at the beginning of the young men\'s festivities during the family festival apelli ().The words are believed by some scholars to have come from the Doric term apella, which originally meant a wall, fence, and animal enclosure, respectively.Hesychius is commonly found in plural forms such as apellai, folds, assemblies, and elections.I, p.In Sparta, the popular assembly is called 556 Apella, which corresponds to the ecclesia.R.S.P.Beekes disregarded the association of the theonym with the noun apellai and proposed a Pre-Greek proto-form * Apalyun.Ancient writers have provided evidence for various forms of popular etymology.Accordingly, the name of Apollo is most commonly associated with the Greek verb (apollymi), which means "to destroy" as in other languages.The name is linked to the redemption, purification, apolysis, and aplonism by Plato in Cratylus.']], [[492, 'which city is sited on the absheron

years ago.A rise in tectonic plates and a fall in sea level caused the event 5 million years ago.The landlocked ocean was characterized by warm and dry climates, which led to the almost complete deposition of evaporitic sediments like halite, covered by wind-blown deposits, and sealed off as a sealant sink in cool and wet climate.The Mediterranean is situated on evaporite beds that are similar.The Caspian Sea\'s northern regions are now made up of a freshwater lake due to the current inflow of fresh water.The catchment basin has little impact on the saline quality of the Iranian shore.Presently, the Caspian has a salinity that is one third of Earth\'s oceans.The Garabogazköl embayment, which was caused by a blockage of the Caspian\'s main body in the 1980s and has since restored, regularly exceeds oceanic salinity by 10 times.Geographically, the Caspian Sea is the most extensive inland body of water globally, and it makes up 40 to 44 percent of all global lagoon waters.Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan all have coastlines that are adjacent to the Caspian.There are three distinct physical regions in the Caspian: the Northern, Middle, and Southern areas.']], [[493, 'punchestown racecourse is in which european country?', "In the parish of Eadestown, Ireland, Punchestown Racecourse is situated between the R410 and R411 regional roads

Brassicaceae family includes plants like cabbages, horseradish, and mustard.The term horseradish in Japan is used interchangeably with wasabi, as it is a rare plant.The stem of this plant is utilized as a condiment and has pronounced pungency, comparable to hot mustard or capsaicin in chili pepper form, producing vapours that stimulate the nasal cavity more than the tongue.The plant grows in mountain river valleys in Japan, typically along stream beds.The two primary cultivars in the market are E.There are several species of japonicum, such as the genus Daruma and Mazuma.The earliest historical records provide insight into the origins of wasabi cuisine;Its growth is evident in Nara prefecture.Wasabi is commonly marketed as a stem, which must be finely grated before use, dried powder in bulk, or as an edible paste packaged in tubes like travel toothpaste.The stem of the plant, which bears the recognizable leaf scar, is not actually a root or rhizome due to its high concentration of water.In some high-end restaurants, the paste is prepared when customers order it and then a grater is used to agitate the stem;If the paste is left unaided, it will lose its taste after 15 minutes of being prepared.The preservation of the flavor of wasabi is a key factor in why sushi chefs usually place it between fish and rice when making sushi, as it can be preserved until served.Wasabi stems have a spicy flavor that can be enjoyed when eaten fresh.To create a crunchy snack, legumes can be prepared by roasting or frying them, adding wasabi powder, sugar, salt, or oil, and eating them raw.The high cost of cultivating Surrogates Wasabi is a result of its challenging nature.It is uncommon to find genuine wasabi plants in areas other than Japan.Due to its high cost, a common substitute is often horseradish diluted with mustard, starch, and green food coloring or spinach powder.Wasabi is often used to describe packages, but the ingredients are not actually made of that plant.Due to their similar levels of isothiocyanate, wasabi and horseradish have comparable taste and pungency.Wasabi's natural green hue is the main factor that distinguishes it from other species, primarily their color.The Japanese refer to horseradish as.In the United States, true wasabi is typically only found in specialty stores and high-end restaurants.The initial pungency of

during cell rupture due to maceration leads to the hydrolysis reaction.The g.The grating of the plant.The pungency of horseradish and mustard is due to the same compound.The unique taste of wasabi is a result of the intricate chemical blends produced from broken plant cells, such as those resulting from the hydrolysis of thioglucosides into glucose and methylthiophenyl isocyanates.The absence of oil in wasabi causes them to have a longer duration than chili peppers, leading to burning sensations that require more food or liquid to wash away.The sensation is mainly felt in the nasal cavity and can be quite painful depending on the quantity of food consumed.The inhalation or sniffing of wasabi vapor results in an aromatic substance that resembles smelling salts, which is utilized by scientists to construct a smoke alarm for the deaf.Within 10 seconds, a deaf individual woke up from the test of the prototype after it was sprayed with wasabi vapor.The researchers were recognized

blood sugar levels?', 'The blood glucose level, also known as blood sugar level refers to the quantity of sugar in the bloodstream of a person or animal.Blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by the body in accordance with metabolic homeostasis.The majority of the body\'s cells derive their energy from glucose, with some exceptions where blood lipids, such as fats and oils, are primarily a small energy store.The bloodstream transports glucose from the intestines or liver to body cells, which then allows insulin production in the pancreas to be used for cell absorption.The average glucose levels drop in the morning, before the first meal of the day (known as the fasting level), and rise by a few milligrams after meals for an hour or two.The presence of a medical condition can be indicated by blood sugar levels that are not within the normal range.Hyperglycemia is a condition that requires constant high levels of glucose;Hypoglycemia is the term used to describe low levels of glucose.The most significant condition of diabetes mellitus is the failure to regulate blood sugar levels, and it is caused by persistent hyperglycemia arising from various factors.When alcohol is consumed, blood sugar levels rise initially, but then decreases in a subsequent phase.Furthermore, some medications can elevate or lower glucose levels.The standard measurement unit for blood glucose levels worldwide is molar concentration, expressed in millimoles per litre.The abbreviation for millimolar (or mM) is utilized.West-Germany and other countries use mg/dL as the standard unit for measuring mass concentration.Due to the fact that glucose C6H12O6 has a molecular weight of 180, the difference between the scales for glucose measurement is 18 by 1, so 1 mmol/L of glucose is equivalent to 18 mg/dL.The range of values for normal humans varies slightly between different laboratories.The blood sugar level of an individual is influenced by various factors.The homeostatic process in the body restores blood sugar levels to a low level of approximately 4.Between 4 and 6,A concentration of 1 mmol/L equals 79.The fasting blood glucose test measures between 2 and 110 mg/dL.During fasting, non-diabetics should test for their blood glucose level to be between 3 and 4.9 and 5The standard measurement is 5 mmol/L, with concentrations ranging from 70 to 100 mg/dL.The

second largest city in Scotland.A mid-year population estimate for 2014 was 148,260.The location is situated in the eastern central Lowlands, on the northern side of the Firth of Tay river, which flows into the North Sea.One of the 32 council areas for local government in Scotland is Dundee City.Originally part of Angus, the city transformed into a medieval burgh and expanded rapidly in the 19th century, primarily due to the growth of the jute industry.Dundee's reputation as the city of  jute, jam, and journalism was due to its other major industries.The population of Dundee reached its highest point in 1971 with a peak of 182,204.Dundee is now known as 'One City, Many Discoveries' due to its rich scientific history and the RRS Discovery, Robert Falcon Scott's Antarctic exploration vessel built in the city.Since the 1980s, biomedical and technological industries have emerged, and the city now accounts for 10% of the UK's digital-entertainment industry.Dundee is home to two universities, namely the University of Dundese and Abertay University.In 2014, Dundee was acknowledged by the United Nations as the first UNESCO City of Design in the UK for its diverse contributions to fields such as medical research, comics, and video games.The presence of two professional football clubs with stadiums almost entirely adjacent to each other is a unique feature of Dundee.The regeneration and reconnection of the Waterfront to the city centre, which was started in 2001, is set to be finished within 30 years, with the Dundee Victoria & Albert Museum scheduled to open by 2018 at a cost of £80 million.The name Dundee is derived from two parts: the Celtic place-name element dun, which means fort; and the historical origin of the name.The second segment may have Celtic roots, which are linked to the Gaelic term dè that signifies 'fire'.Although there is ample evidence of human habitation, Dundee's growth as a seaport town may have been due to William the Lion'S charter, which granted it to his younger brother, David, who would later become Earl of Huntingdon in the late 12th century.A period of prosperity and growth was witnessed in the town due to its promotion as a trading centre by Earl David.The earldom was passed down from David's descendants, among them John Balliol.The town was granted the status of a Royal Burgh upon John's coronation in 1292.English forces occupied the town and its castle for several years during the First War of Independence, and Robert the Bruce recaptured them in early 1312.Bruce renewed the original Burghal charters in 1327 after they were lost during the occupation.During the Rough Wooing of 1543 to 1550, the burgh experienced significant hardship and was under the occupation of Andrew Dudley's English troops from 1547.Dudley ordered the burning of the town to the ground in 1548 after failing to hold up against an advancing Scottish force.Dundee was once again besieged by the Royalist Marquess of Montrose during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in 1645.In 1651, the town was ultimately destroyed by Parliamentarian forces led by George Monck.The establishment of the Jacobite cause was largely due to the engagement of John Graham of Claverhouse, 1st Viscount Dundee, who raised the Stuart standard on the Dundese Law in 1689.The Jacobites were in control of the town during the 1715-16 rebellion, and on January 6, 1716, James VIII and III, the Old Pretender, who claimed the throne, entered the city publicly.A significant number of people in Scotland, including many in Dundee, believed that he was the rightful monarch.Raw wool was the mainstay of the medieval economy in Dundee, and the production of finished textiles was a response to the 15th-century recession."]], [[498, 'according to famous american architect louis henri sullivan, known as the father of skyscrapers, "form follows what"?', "Louis Henry Sullivan, the architect who was born in New York in September 1856 and died in April 1924, is known as the father of modernism and skyscrapers.The man who created the modern skyscraper is widely recognized as his inspiration, while he was an influential architect and critic of the Chicago School, mentored Frank Lloyd Wright, and served as a model for the Prairie School.Sullivan is among the recognized trinity of American architects, including Henry Hobson, Richardson and Frank Lloyd Wright.Although he acknowledged the ancient Roman architect as the originator of the concept of form follows function, it is still attributed to him.He was the second architect to receive the AIA Gold Medal posthumously in 1944.The parents of Louis Henry Sullivan, who came to the United States in the late 1840s, were Andrienne List and Patrick Connor, and they had children together.Noticing that he could graduate high school a year ahead of schedule and pass the first two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by taking standardized tests.At sixteen, he began his studies of architecture at MIT and later took up the program for a short time.He attended school for a year and then moved to Philadelphia, where he was employed by architect Frank Furness.The Depression of 1873 caused Furness's work to dry up, leading him to release Sullivan.In 1873, Sullivan relocated to Chicago to be part of the building boom that followed the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.William LeBaron Jenney, the architect who is often credited with constructing the first steel-frame building, was his employer.Sullivan spent less than a year with Jenney before moving to Paris and attending the École des Beaux-Arts.Upon his arrival in Chicago, he was employed by the firm of Joseph S.The draftsman was Johnston and John Edelman.The Moody Tabernacle was designed by

partner.Sullivan's most fruitful years began with this.Adler and Sullivan gained their initial fame as architects of the theater.Although their theaters were mostly situated in Chicago, they gained recognition by receiving commissions from as far west as Pueblo, Colorado, and Seattle, Washington (unoccupied).During the last phase of the company's history, the 1889 Auditorium Building in Chicago was constructed, featuring an extraordinary mixed-use building that featured not only two theaters but also a hotel and office building. The structure had commercial storefronts at the ground level, with its 17-story tower facing Congress Avenue and Wabash Avenue adjacent to it.The firm's office buildings, including the Wainwright Building in St., gained notoriety after 1889.In 1890, Louis and the Schiller Building and theater were constructed in Chicago.The Chicago Stock Exchange Building, the Guaranty Building (also called the Prudential Building) in Buffalo, New York, and the Carson Pirie Scott Department Store by Sullivan on State Street in Chicago are some of the other buildings that are frequently mentioned.The strength of the walls in a multistory building was the primary factor that prevented it from being supported, as seen with Sullivan's steel high-rise.The higher the building's height, the more pressure it places on its lower parts;Due to the obvious limitations in engineering that allowed for the bearing of loads, walls could be kept stable. This led to extremely thick walls on the ground floors and definite restrictions on building height.The emergence of affordable and adaptable steel in the latter half of the 1800s modified the regulations.The rapid growth of social and economic forces in America provided significant prospects for architectural design.A more urbanized society was emerging, which demanded new and larger structures."]], [[499, 'which african country is bordered to the east by chad, to the south by nigeria and benin, to west by mali, and to the north by algeria and libya?', "The westernmost part of Africa, known as West Africa or the West of Afrikan, is a subcontinent.The definition of West Africa includes 18 countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberiana, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Helena and Senegal, as well as Sao Tome and Principe.The history of West Africa can be divided into five periods, which include the first waves of human settlers arriving, the development of agriculture, and contact with people in the north.The Iron Age empires were responsible for consolidating both intra- and extra-African trade and developing centralized states.Large nations prospered and experienced a prolonged period of interaction with non-African populations;During the colonial period, Great Britain and France held sway over almost the entire region.The post-independence period marked the emergence of modern nations.West Africa was first settled by early human settlers from northern Holocene societies around 12,000 B.A.Sedentary farming was initiated in the fifth millennium B.Along with the domestication of cattle, C.By the year 1500,The development of ironworking technology facilitated the growth of agricultural productivity, leading to the establishment of the first city-states.During the year 400, northern tribes built walled and unwalled settlements.The forest region witnessed the growth of Iron Age cultures, as well as the emergence of inter-regional trade.Trade with upper Mediterranean peoples is evident due to the Sahara's desertification and coastal climate change.The domestication of the camel facilitated a trans-Saharan trade with diverse societies, including Carthage and the Berbers;The primary exports comprised of gold, cotton, metal ornaments, and leather goods, which were later substituted with salt, horses, textiles or other resources.Many of the empires that came after were able to achieve great prosperity thanks to the use of local resources like leather, cloth, and gold.The economy of the region's development facilitated the rise of centralized states and civilizations, starting with the Nok culture that emerged around 1000 B.A.The Ghana Empire, which was in existence from the 1st to 3rd centuries, eventually succumbed to the Mali Empire.The towns of Tichit and Oualata in modern-day Mauritania have archaeological sites that date back to approximately 2000 B.C.They were discovered to have come from the Soninke faction of the Mandé tribe.According to the archaeological evidence of Kumbi Saleh in modern-day Mauritania, the Mali empire held sway over a significant portion of the area until they were conquered by the Almoravids in 1052.The Sosso Empire endeavored to fill the void, but was unsuccessful.Sundiata Keita, the founder of the new Mali Empire, was defeated by the Mandinka forces in 1240.The Mali Empire flourished for several centuries, notably under Musa I's rule, but eventually fell to Mossi, Tuareg, and Songhai after a succession of feeble rulers.Sonni Ali and Askia Mohammed were in charge of the establishment of a new powerful state in the Songhai Empire, which was based on Gao during the 15th century.In the southern region of Sudan, strong urban states emerged like Nri Kingdom in the 10th century, which contributed to the development of Igbo culture and traditions, Bono in 12th Century, and Ife and Benin City in 14th-century.Towards the east, Oyo emerged as the primary Yoruba state and the Aro Confederacy became an important Igbo state in modern-day Nigeria.In 1445, Portuguese traders who were involved in slavery and European contact started establishing settlements along the coast, which were then followed by French, English, Danish, and Dutch;The African slave trade commenced shortly after, and over the next few centuries, it would weaken the economy and population of the region.The exchange of slaves for European firearms was among the economic activities that spurred the formation of states like the Asante Empire, Bambara Empire and Dahomey."]]]
