The individual is the final judge of right and wrong. More than this, since only individuals act, only individuals can act unjustly. When the government knocks on the door, it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood. Before Thoreau’s imprisonment, when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay, Thoreau had advised, “Resign.” If a man chose to be an agent of injustice, then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice. But if government is “the voice of the people,” as it is often called, shouldn’t that voice be heeded? Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians. Even a good form of government is “liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.” Moreover, even if a government did express the voice of the people, this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said.

Thus, civil disobedience becomes a means for individuals to protest and challenge the legitimacy of unjust laws and the authority that enforces them.

The establishment of the Yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of Muslims in China. However, unlike the western khanates, the Yuan dynasty never converted to Islam. Instead, Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, favored Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants. As a result, Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion. The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) at court. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor, thereby enjoying special power. Furthermore, Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art. Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large scale after 1300. Many Mongols of the upper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized Confucian scholars and institutions.

Furthermore, Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art. Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large scale after 1300. Many Mongols of the upper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized Confucian scholars and institutions. A considerable number of Confucian and Chinese historical works were translated into the Mongolian language.', 'modContext': "During the Yuan dynasty, a wide range of religions were observed, including Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity.China experienced a significant rise in its Muslim population following the establishment of the Yuan dynasty.In contrast to the western khanates, the Yuan dynasty did not embrace Islam as their official religion.Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, had a preference for Buddhism, particularly the Tibetan variations.Consequently, Tibetan Buddhism became the dominant religion of the state.To oversee Buddhist monks across the empire, the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was established in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing). This top-level department and government agency was responsible for the supervision of monks.Due to Kublai Khan's strong admiration for the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, the significance of other religious practices diminished.He and his successors maintained a Sakya Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) in their court.During the Yuan dynasty, before its decline, a total of 14 leaders from the Sakya sect were appointed as Imperial Preceptors. This prestigious position granted them unique authority and influence.Moreover, the support and sponsorship of Buddhism by the Mongol rulers led to the creation of several significant Buddhist art structures.The translation of Mongolian Buddhist texts, primarily derived from Tibetan sources, commenced on a significant scale after the year 1300.Confucian scholars and institutions were favored by various members of the upper class in Mongolia, including the Jalayir and Oronar nobles and even the emperors.The Mongolian language saw a significant number of translations of Confucian and Chinese historical works.", 'question': "What was Kublai's least favorite sect of Tibetan Buddhism?

However, the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison. In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed.
