However, plants have their own mechanism to defend against diseases. Plant immune responses often rely on systemic chemical signals that are transmitted throughout the plant.PAMPs, also referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, are recognized by individual plant cells as molecules associated with pathogens.In the event of an infection, plants have a mechanism in place to combat it known as the localized hypersensitive response. When a specific part of a plant becomes infected, the plant initiates this response wherein cells at the site of infection undergo a rapid process of apoptosis.

The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis.

In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits Ex post facto laws, i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published.
