With Orville flying first, the brothers took turns as pilot, and they flew three more times that day. On their fourth try, they managed to go 852 feet in 59 seconds ----an amazing feat at the time. The two brothers had invented powered flight. Orville and Wilbur Wright owned a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Although they had not gone to school to learn about airplanes or engineering, they were good mechanics. By repairing bicycles, they had learned how gears and pulleys worked. They also learned to take careful notes about what they saw. Each time they made a new design and tested a machine, they took notes and made drawings. They would study these to figure out what they could do better the next time.Before the Wright brothers flew, they did many things to prepare for this extraordinary achievement. They read everything they could find about air, balloons, and kites. Then they made careful sketches of what they wanted to build. They began by making model kites to learn how air flowed over wings. They made them bigger and bigger until they had a glider -- a kite that is big enough to hold a person, but with no engine. The Wright brothers made three gliders before building their first airplane. Each time they made a glider, they would test it, make careful observations, and then improve their design. When they made a glider that flew well, they added an engine. This step was harder than it sounds, because they had to find an engine that was both light-weight and powerful. The engines that they could buy were either too heavy or too weak, so they asked their friend Charlie Taylor to help them build one. The first engine that Charlie built broke almost immediately, but the second one worked well.   After Orville and Wilbur installed the engine in their plane, they were almost ready. They simply had to wait for the perfect day with just the fight amount of wind. On the morning of December 17, 1903, they had their chance. And the airplane flew into history.", "modContext": "m.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying\"It got lost\"to\"I lost it\". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.George Bernard Shaw once said,\"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\"\"Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,\"said Albert Schweitzer.The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.\"It's not my responsibility,\"said the nurse,\"because it's a large puddle  .\"The housekeeper didn't agree.\"Well, it's not mine,\"she said,\"the puddle is too small.\"The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.\"Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?\"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.", "modContext": "What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever?

Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity.

By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. \"Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted,\" he says. \"If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it.\" What's more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.Shy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. \"Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations,\" Taylor says. \"It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room.\" In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren't shy.

The thunder of their hooves   rings in the riders' ears, nearly drowning out the cheering of the crowd. After three or four minutes of suspense, one horse crosses the finish line first, winning the Melbourne Cup and earning a place in history.The horses that compete in the Melbourne Cup--one of the world's most famous horseraces--were fated to race. Bred for speed, these horses are the few that were singled out as having potential to become champions.Preparing a racehorse to compete requires a team. A horse's owner manages the team and decides which races to enter. A trainer determines the racehorse's diet and exercise. Regular exercise makes a horse less likely to be injured, but overtraining tires the horse. A groomer   cares for the racehorse and reports any problems he discovers to the trainer. And of course, no horserace could be run without a rider. These riders train for long hours and travel constantly from one race to another. They need to make a strategy, adapt to changing conditions and communicate with their horse to guide it to victory.Australia's most famous horserace, the Melbourne Cup, is 3,200 meters of pure excitement. Each year 300 or 400 horses are nominated  , but only 24 can run. The competitors are chosen based on a number of factors, but winners of certain races qualify automatically.Each racehorse receives a handicap--a certain weight it must carry to give each horse an equal chance of winning--two months before the race. Originally, horses that seemed likely to win were assigned larger handicaps. But the rules have changed, reducing the handicap for previous winners.The first Melbourne Cup in 1861 drew a crowd of 4,000 spectators, and the race's popularity has grown since then. Held on the first Tuesday of November, the cup has become a four-day festival with fine food and entertainment.The Melbourne Cup began during a gold rush as a form of entertainment for the rich. Today it still attracts society's upper class.

The idea seems absurd .Yet I've had friends argue that plant intelligence might exist. \"What are the differences between plants and animals?\" they ask, and then they argue about certain species that seem to share the intelligence of both plants and animals. New research suggests that plants communicate via \"networks\". Plant communication is not idea, and cannot indicate that it is a kind of intelligence, but it is still interesting.Recent research from Vidi researcher Josef Stuefer at the Radboud University Nijmegen shows that plants have their own chat systems that they can use to warn each other. Therefore plants are not boring and passive organisms that just stand there waiting to be cut down or eaten up. Many plants form internal communication networks and are able to exchange information networks and are able to exchange information efficiently.Many herbal plants such as strawberries and clovers  naturally form networks. Individual plants remain connected with each other for a certain period of time by means of runners (plant stems that grow along the ground and put down roots to form new plants). These connections enable the plants to share information with each other via internal channels. They are therefore very similar to computer networks. But what do plants chat to each other about?Recently Stuefer and hus colleagues were the first to prove that clover plants warn each other via the network links if danger is nearby. If one of the plants is attacked by caterpillars  , the other members of the network are warned via an internal signal. Once warned the intact  plants strengthen their chemical and mechanicaicl resistance so that they are less attractive to advancing  caterpillars.

Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children.The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes  were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes.In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others.The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however.

I classify   them according to how well I know them and how well they know me.The first type of friend is just an acquaintance  .This means that you only know their name. You might not even remember what they look like if you go away for a short vacation. You don't miss them when they are elsewhere. It is also this type of friend who gives you the most amount of aggravation  .Since most of the time you are placed in a position where you have to act friendly. You would not normally tell an acquaintance when he or she is doing something that makes you feel angry,such as tapping the fingers on a table or shouting loudly. I call them \"pest friends\".The second kind of friend is a \"guest friend\".They are just social partners. You meet them at a certain location and at the end of the meeting you go your separate way and they go theirs.

He says Ethyl Pyruvate makes the mosquitoes' receptors inactive. \"When we apply Ethyl Pyruvate to a human arm and offer it to hungry mosquitoes in a cage, very few of the mosquitoes are attracted to the human arm because only a few of them are able to smell it out,\" said Ray.Genevieve Tauxe, a member of the research team, says it was not easy to find the neurons   of noble cells that recognize both the smell of human breath and skin. \"With the device used to examine the mosquito, we are able to insert a very small electrode   into the part of the mosquito's nose, where its smelling neurons are and where the smell is happening,\" said Tauxe.Anandasankar Ray says a product based on Ethyl Pyruvate may cost less to produce than DEFT, the most effective chemical treatment now in use.

The program, called Project BudBurst, collects life cycle data on different kinds of common plants from across the prefix = st1 /United States.\"People don 't have to be plant experts-they just have to look around and see what's in their neighbourhood,\"says Jennifer Schwartz, an adviser with the project, \"As we collect this data, we'll be able to predict how plants and communities of plants and animals will respond as the climate changes.\" That data will help scientists predict not only how natural communities may change but also how these changes will affect people.Scientists monitoring lilac   flowering in the western United States reported that in years when lilacs bloomed early - before May 20th-wildfires later in the summer and fall are larger and more severe.  _ , Jennifer says.Improved monitoring is an important step toward predicting how natural communities will respond to climate change.\"The best way for us to increase our knowledge of how plants and animals are responding to climate change is to increase the amount of data we have,\" he says. \"That 's why we need citizen scientists to get as much information from as many places on as many species over as long a time period as we can.\"", "modContext": " To understand it, we need to monitor key life cycle events-flowering, the appearance of leaves the first frog calls of the spring-all around the world.

Teachers worry too much about the psychological implications   of their lessons, and forget about the subjects themselves. If a child dislikes a lesson, the teacher feels that it is his fault, not the child's. So teachers worry whether history is \"relevant\" to modern young children.

Can they tell their classes about children of different races, or will this encourage racial hatred? Why teach children to write grammatical sentences? Verbal expression is better. Sums? Arithmetic? No: Real-life mathematical situations are more understandable.You see, you can go too far. Influenced by educational theorists, who have nothing better to do than to write books about their ideas, teachers leave their teacher-training colleges filled with grand, psychological ideas about children and their needs.

I decided they must be outside.Why they might be outside at 10:30 on a winter night I had no idea, but it was the only explanation I could come up with.Finally, in desperation, I called his girlfriend's house.

In 1998, they were proven completely wrong. Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. One possible explanation is that empty space has a thing called dark energy, which supposedly makes up about three quarters of the universe. Dark energy supposedly very sparsely  exists in such a way that it interacts with other objects only through attracting force. It has a strong negative pressure, which causes it to pull on its surroundings and as a result, pull apart the universe. This neatly explains the universe's expansion without completely changing our understanding of the universe. Scientists can merely claim that dark energy \"should\" exist. According to Einstein's theory of relativity, it is impossible to travel faster than at the speed of light. With this in mind, physicists set out to do the impossible and succeeded. In 2000, scientists in Princeton, New Jersey sent a small pulse  of laser light through a vapor made up of gaseous cesium . The pulse traveled so quickly that it was already leaving the vapor-filled chamber as it was still entering, roughly 300 times faster than it would have in a vacuum . Thus, light moved faster than the speed of light. Other experiments have since managed to conquer light's supposed speed limit, though all claims have had fine print that keeps them from being especially groundbreaking . Those seeking to truly prove Einstein wrong must instead turn to objects like black holes, which could theoretically cause things to move at faster-than-light speeds. Black holes have been proven to be particularly uncooperative test subjects though, and for now this remains a guess.", "modContext": " Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.

Many modern technologies were invented by human such as cars, computers and Internet. But advances in technology lead to our pace of life much faster than before. People have not enough time with their family.It is evident that the causes of this phenomenon are different. In the first place, advancing in technology improves the efficiency of production, but also causes people to do more things at the same time. Moreover, this is especially true when we consider the fact that the global financial crisis in recent years has led many people to fear losing their job, and the significant rising costs of life which need people to work harder than before. Besides, employees may be scattered at the whole world. For example, my friend often holds a meeting at middle-night with his colleague who stays in the US and he still needs to work at daytime.In my opinion, the impact of this phenomenon on families and society is profound.

They may spend much time in front of TV or computer games which have much violence and may seriously influence children's growth. Furthermore, the increasingly over-speed lifestyle will engender a higher incidence of illness.

These nations now face some tough choices.

At one time, this was pretty much true. During the Roman Empire, lots of roads were built in order to move armies, send messages by courier  , and make trade easier. This construction work went on for five centuries! If all the roads built during the Roman Empire were put together end to end, they would circle the equator twice.The network of Roman roads was begun in 312 BC. It was demanded that the roads be built strong so that they would not fall down. Roman soldiers, supervised   by engineers, laid down the roads in a special pattern of layers. The first layer was made of sand. Next, the builders added rocks and rubble. On top of these materials came gravel. On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.Also, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.All Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile). The milestones told when the road was built, who was emperor at the time, the road's destination, how far the traveler was from the destination, and how many miles had been traveled since the beginning of the road.

Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine.  It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first.  We have strange relationships with our pets. We look after our pets with great love and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the kind treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps.  A recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog? Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.   What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.  We prison people who abuse animals, put ourselves in harm's way in boats between whales and whalers and show sympathy to Bambi and his mother. We can extend sympathy to an animal and feel its pain like no other species. But let's not be too proud of ourselves. As this study and too much of our history show, we're pretty selective about how we extend our kindness to other human beings.", "modContext": "Recently, a case of lifeboat ethics   occurred.

Well,Mary Anderson came up  with the idea in 1902 after a visit to New York City.The day was cold and stormy,but  Anderson still wanted to see the sights,so she jumped aboard a streetcar.Noticing that the driver was struggling to see through the snow covering the windshield,she found herself wondering why there couldn't be a built--in device for cleaning the window.Still wondering about this when she returned home to Birmingham,Alabama, Anderson started drafting out solutions.One of her ideas,a lever on the inside of a vehicle that would control an arm on the outside,became the first
