Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying\"It got lost\"to\"I lost it\". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.George Bernard Shaw once said,\"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\"\"Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,\"said Albert Schweitzer.The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up.

By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. \"Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted,\" he says. \"If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it.\" What's more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.Shy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. \"Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations,\" Taylor says. \"It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room.\" In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren't shy.

They need to make a strategy, adapt to changing conditions and communicate with their horse to guide it to victory.Australia's most famous horserace, the Melbourne Cup, is 3,200 meters of pure excitement. Each year 300 or 400 horses are nominated  , but only 24 can run. The competitors are chosen based on a number of factors, but winners of certain races qualify automatically.Each racehorse receives a handicap--a certain weight it must carry to give each horse an equal chance of winning--two months before the race. Originally, horses that seemed likely to win were assigned larger handicaps. But the rules have changed, reducing the handicap for previous winners.The first Melbourne Cup in 1861 drew a crowd of 4,000 spectators, and the race's popularity has grown since then. Held on the first Tuesday of November, the cup has become a four-day festival with fine food and entertainment.The Melbourne Cup began during a gold rush as a form of entertainment for the rich. Today it still attracts society's upper class. They come dressed in their finest to enjoy the event in comfort.But anyway it's all about the race--the effort of horses and riders, the suspense and the thrill of victory.", "modContext": "Twenty-four horses race around a racecourse.The hooves of the riders were so loud that their voices almost drowned out the cheering crowd.After three or four minutes of excitement, the Melbourne Cup winner sets a record by winning and finishing first in history.The horses that were destined to race in the Melbourne Cup, one of the world's most famous horseraces, were determined to do so.These horses, which are specially bred for speed, were the sole ones that were specifically chosen to have the potential to win races.A team is necessary to prepare a racehorse for competition.The team is managed by the owner of the horse, who chooses which races to enter.The diet and exercise regimen of the racehorse is determined by a trainer.The likelihood of injury for a horse is lower when they are regularly exercised, but overtraining makes the horse tiresome.The racehorse is groomed by a professional and the trainer is informed of any problems found.A rider is necessary for any horserace to succeed.These riders spend hours preparing for the races and travel from one race to another.They must devise a plan, adjust to changing circumstances and communicate with their horse to propel it towards success.The Melbourne Cup, the most renowned horserace in Australia, is known for its thrilling ride at an elevation of 3,200 meters.Every year, around 300 to 400 horses are nominated, but only 24 of them can manage the competition.Multiple factors are taken into account when choosing competitors, but some races have automatic qualification for the top finishers.Two months before the race, each racehorse is given a handicap, which is the weight it must carry to ensure that every horse has an equal shot at winning.In the beginning, horses that appeared to be winning were given higher handicaps.The handicap for previous winners has been reduced due to the introduction of new rules.The Melbourne Cup, which began in 1861 and attracted 4,000 spectators, has become more popular ever since.The cup, which is now a four-day festival featuring fine food and entertainment, takes place on the first Tuesday of November.The Melbourne Cup was initially organized as a celebration for the wealthy during the gold rush.It continues to attract the elite members of society.They arrive in their finest attire to enjoy the occasion with ease.The race is primarily about the exertion of horses and riders, the excitement and thrill of triumph.", "question": "The passage can most probably be found in   _  .choose between the following alphabet:A.a sports journal.B.a business newspaper.C.an academic paper.D.a health magazine.", "groundTruth": [["a sports journal"]], "answer": "a sports journal.", "modAnswer": "a sports journal.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": []},{"test case number": 76, "context": "Whether in the home or the workplace, social robots are going to become a lot more common in the next few years.

How can the appearance of a product be more important than what it does? The battle between form and function rose again when James Dyson, British inventor of the Dvson vacuum cleaner that has sold in millions around the world, resigned as chairman of London's Design Museum. It is widely believed that Mr. Dyson felt that the museum put too much stress on style at the expense of serious industrial design.Mr. Dyson accused the museum of not keeping true to itself. He may be right, but these days, museums everywhere can no longer afford to be unique centers of scholarship and learning. Among competition for sponsorship, they must use exhibitions of populist culture, nice cafes and shops or, best of all, a new building by Frank Gehry to increase visitor numbers.On the one hand, some producers can be too old-fashioned and too concerned with the importance of product engineering and the functionality of their goods. On the other hand, there are those who believe that how a product looks is more important. Design is indeed a broad term, involving both function and form. Typically, in any given product area, it changes from the former to the latter.  Clothing is a good example. But surely you would have to be a very shallow person to think something's appearance is more important than what it does.Today nearly all goods at any given price point do much the same job. So almost the  only way producers can differentiate their products from those of their competitors is to create some sort of emotional connection with the consumer, which could be through the visual appeal of the product or its packaging, or the imagery  created by advertising. And what of the Dyson vacuum cleaner?

When my parents bought the house, in 1982, they were only two years older than I am now. I tried to imagine myself in two years, ready to settle down and buy the house I'd still be living in almost 30 years later.    It seemed ridiculous. On a practical level, there's no way I could afford to buy a house anytime soon. More importantly, I wouldn't want to. I'm not sure where I'll be living in two years, or what kind of job I'll have. And I don't think I'll be ready to settle down and stay in one place.    So this is probably the generation gap that divides my friends and me from our parents. When our parents were our age, they'd gotten their education, chosen a career, and were starting to settle into responsible adult lives.    My friends and I - \"Generation Y\" - still aren't sure what we want to do with our lives. Whatever we end up doing, we want to make sure we're happy doing it. We'd rather take risks first, try out different jobs, and move from one city to another until we find our favorite place. We'd rather spend our money on travel than put it in a savings account.    This casual attitude toward responsibility has caused some critics to call my generation \"arrogant\", \"impatient\", and \"overprotected\". Some of these complaints have a point. As children ,we were encouraged to succeed in school, but also to have fun. We grew up in a world full of technological innovation: cellphones, the Internet, instant messaging, and video games.    Our parents looked to rise vertically --starting at the bottom of the ladder and slowly making their way to the top, on the same track, often for the same company.

Supported by the Ladies' Association in London for the promotion of female education in India and the East, she immediately took up the work of starting a girls' school for Chinese girls, which was soon followed by the opening of a boys' school.Mrs. Gutzlaff's comprador  happened to come from my village and was actually my father's friend and neighbor. It was through him that my parents heard about Mrs. Gutzlaff's school and it was doubtlessly through his influence and means that my father got me admitted into the school. It has always been a mystery to me why my parents should put me into a foreign school, instead of a traditional Confucian school, where my big brother was placed. Most certainly such a step would have been more suitable for Chinese public opinion, taste, and the wants of the country, than to allow me to attend an English school. Moreover, a Chinese belief is the only avenue in China that leads to political promotion, influence, power and wealth. I can only guess that as foreign communication with China was just beginning to grow, my parents hoped that it might be worthwhile to put one of their sons to learning English.

The theories of modem psychology have stepped in to argue that we must understand the need of children. Children are not just small adults; they are children who must be respected as much.Well, you may say, this is as it should be, a good idea. But think further. What happens? \"Education\" becomes the responsibility not of teachers, but of psychologists  . What happens then? Teachers worry too much about the psychological implications   of their lessons, and forget about the subjects themselves. If a child dislikes a lesson, the teacher feels that it is his fault, not the child's. So teachers worry whether history is \"relevant\" to modern young children. And do they dare to recount stories about violence? Or will this make the children themselves violent? Can they tell their classes about children of different races, or will this encourage racial hatred? Why teach children to write grammatical sentences? Verbal expression is better. Sums? Arithmetic? No: Real-life mathematical situations are more understandable.You see, you can go too far.

extensive teaching facilities and the institute's own medical center.Over the years, the institute has also extended through the establishment of around thirty research centers in other countries.At each one, researchers help local authorities monitor public health and provide medical treatment.Unlike many research organizations, the Pasteur Institute is not government funded.Instead it relies on

The day was founded in 1999 to celebrate the incredible companionship dogs provide and to encourage animal adoption.Dogs have been having their day for some time now. Everywhere you look, there is some kind of pet-project going on, which for a dog lover like me, is a dream come true.There are dogs starring in reality TV. Doggy day care is in high demand. Big well-known companies like Paul Mitchell, Omaha Steaks, and Harley Davidson have all jumped on the gravy-train   offering pet products including shampoos, food and clothes. The pet insurance business is booming. And, luxury hotels and apartment buildings are also catering to our furry friends, finally.Make no bones about it, the pet industry is a multi-billion dollar business. According to the American Pet Products Association, 62 percent households in the U.S. own a pet. It's estimated that owners will spend about $55.5 billion on goods and services for their pets this year, up about $2 billion from last year.That's a small price to pay for the unconditional love and loyalty you get from a pet. The bond between dog and dog owner began about 30,000 years ago when dogs started to become domesticated  .

What she saw there made her stop dead in her tracks.Being a busy college student just one year removed from her teenage years, she wasn't exactly obsessive-compulsive  about the neatness of her clothes. But her boss at the restaurant where she works saw things a little differently. He had recently lectured the entire staff on the importance of appearance, and had specifically mentioned the need for servers to wear clean, unwrinkled blouses. As an assistant manager, Janelle felt it was important to set an example for the other employees. But if she stopped to iron the blouse normally, she would be late --and work without delay was an area of even greater concern to her boss.So she grabbed her iron and plugged it in and set it for low heat. Carefully holding her blouse away from her body, she continued to iron it while she was wearing it. It seemed like a logical answer to an urgent problem.And it seemed to be working until Janelle tried to iron the collar and accidentally ironed her neck by mistake. Then it suddenly seemed like a really stupid idea and a really painful one as well. It took more time to treat her burn than it would have taken to iron her shirt properly. And she spent a miserable shift dealing with the pain of the burn.We've all been there, haven't we? For me it was cutting my own hair.

The idea is to encourage healthy eating to fight the country's increasing obesity rate. It's feared that basic cooking and food preparation skills are being lost as parents turn to pre-pre-pared convenience foods.Cooking was once regarded as an important part of education in England-even if it was mainly aimed at girls. In recent decades cooking has progressively become a minor activity in schools. In  many cases the schools themselves have given up cooking meals in kitchens in the schools .But the rising level of obesity has led to a rethink about the food that children are given and the skills they should be taught.\"What I want is to teach young people how to do basic, simple recipes like a tomato sauce, a bolognaise, a simple curry, a stir-fry-which they can use now at home and then in their later life\", said Ed Balls, the minister responsible for schools.The new lessons are due to start in September, but some schools without kitchens will be given longer to adapt. There is also likely to be a shortage of teachers with the right skills, since the trend has been to teach food technology rather than practical cooking.

recent visit to the beautiful Keukenhof flower gardens in Holland, I learned about the practice of topping.As flowers grow, sometimes the growers cut off the tops of the flowers, which they believe causes the plants to invest more energy into flower growth and less into seed production.The expected result is flower buds that will produce higher quality flowers.This is the same with personal growth.Sometimes when we produce first results in a certain area, it can be helpful to cut them off and throw them away.This can free up energy for a stronger attempt elsewhere instead of settling into the comfort zone of satisfaction with the old results.After running my computer games business for 10 years and getting satisfying results with it, I decided to drop it and leave that field behind.This freed up my energy to focus on my personal development writing and speaking.If I'd kept running the old business, this would have meant less energy to invest in my new path.It can be difficult to choose the topping approach because you're taking something that's already reasonably satisfying and cutting it out of your life, in the hopes that something even better will grow in its

If all the roads built during the Roman Empire were put together end to end, they would circle the equator twice.The network of Roman roads was begun in 312 BC. It was demanded that the roads be built strong so that they would not fall down. Roman soldiers, supervised   by engineers, laid down the roads in a special pattern of layers. The first layer was made of sand. Next, the builders added rocks and rubble. On top of these materials came gravel. On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.Also, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.All Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile).

are not affiliated with the Christian religion, the holiday season has become more popular.It's possible to walk around major Chinese cities without seeing many Christmas signs for the past 15 years.According to Cai Jiming, a professor at Tsinghua University and expert in creating China's holiday schedule, the same Chinese cities will have signs of Christmas everywhere.Despite the lack of public holidays, many Chinese cities are still experiencing the holiday season.Cai claims that his email inbox and mobile phone have been bombarded with messages wishing him a happy Christmas.Since the end of November, we have been receiving greetings.He thinks Christmas is a \"warm-up\" for the Spring Festival, which is going to be significant this weekend.Although Christmas celebrations are common, for the majority of Chinese, they do not serve as a religious or family gathering time.Rather than other activities, it's a time to chill out with friends, shop, party and enjoy romance.A hotel manager in Beijing, Christine Zhou, aged 28, claims that she anticipates a romantic night and her boyfriend taking her out on Christmas Eve.\"In my opinion, Christmas is all about the romance.\"\"Rose and chocolate sellers are in competition for customers on the streets.\"Christmas is once again like Valentine's Day, but with more people treating it as a time to indulge in delicious treats and enjoy the holiday season.Despite this, as more Chinese people participate in the Christmas celebrations each year, some believe that the traditions that are based on Western

Our own planet, Earth, is becoming more and more crowed and polluted. Luckily, we can start again and build a better world on Mars. Here is what life could be like.First of all, transport should be much better. At present, our spaceships are too slow to carry large numbers of people to Mars -- it takes months. However, by 2100, spaceship can travel at half the speed of light. It might take us two or three days to get to Mars!Secondly, humans need food, water and air to live. Scientists should be able to develop plants that can be grown on Mars. These plants will produce the food and air that we need. However, can these plants produce water for us ? There is no answer now.There is a problem for us to live on Mars. Mars pulls us much less than the Earth does.

One year, I had a student, John,  who entered my class when he was a junior  . John changed to our school from Greece, and seemed to be interested in athletics, so I encouraged him to join our track team. I explained to him that even though he had never taken part in it before, I did believe that he could do well in any event, and I would be willing to coach him at whichever ones interested him. He accepted the offer, and began to work hard at every practice.About a month later, I had found out from other sources that John was a first-class tennis player, winning various junior awards in his home country. I went to him asking, \"John, I really appreciate that you came out for the track team, but why didn't you play tennis instead?

On Aug. 4, Graham and Sheryl Anley, while boating off the coast of South Africa, hit a rock. As the boat threatened to sink, the husband got off, but his wife was trapped in the boat. Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine.  It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first.  We have strange relationships with our pets. We look after our pets with great love and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the kind treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps.  A recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog? Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.   What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.

On Aug. 4, Graham and Sheryl Anley, while boating off the coast of South Africa, hit a rock. As the boat threatened to sink, the husband got off, but his wife was trapped in the boat. Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine.  It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first.  We have strange relationships with our pets. We look after our pets with great love and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the kind treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps.  A recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog? Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.   What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.  We prison people who abuse animals, put ourselves in harm's way in boats between whales and whalers and show sympathy to Bambi and his mother. We can extend sympathy to an animal and feel its pain like no other species. But let's not be too proud of ourselves.

He wasn't losing weight. Then he showed his food diary to his coach and revealed he'd been eating half a pound of jelly beans a day. \"They don't have any fat,\" he explains. But they had enough sugar to keep him from shedding an ounce. Nonfat foods become add-on foods. When we add them to our diet, we actually increase the number of calories we eat per day and gain weight. That was borne out in a Pennsylvania State University study. For breakfast, Prof. Barbara Rolls gave two groups of women yogurt that contained exactly the same amount of calories. One group's yogurt label said \"high fat\"--the other, \"low fat.\" The \"low fat\" yogurt group ate significantly more calories later in the day than the other group. \"People think they've saved fat and can indulge themselves later in the day with no adverse consequences,\" says Richard Mattes, a nutrition researcher at Purdue University. \"But when they do that, they don't compensate very precisely, and they often end up overdoing it.\"", "modContext": "Americans have been gaining weight, but they have decreased their average fat intake from 36 to 34 percent of their total diets in the last 15 years.Cutting down fat for weight reduction or control is logical.Fat contains nine calories per gram.There are only four sources of protein and carbohydrates.Besides, the metabolism of fat in the body consumes fewer calories than the metabolic processes of other foods.Dietary fat is more readily converted into body fat than protein and carbohydrates, which can be used for energy and to strengthen the body.It is more probable to stay on the buttocks, thighs and bellies.Even if you cut down on fat, your body will still store it.The calorie difference between nonfat and regular cookies is minimal due to the fact that manufacturers add sugar to compensate for fat loss.Low-fat crackers, soups, and dressings can be just as calorie-dense as richer ones.Regardless of the source of calories, excessive eating will result in weight gain.The fat-based calories are consumed at a quicker rate.A Wisconsin computer programmer who received guidance from a diet coach and committed to eating only 40 grams of fat per day, learned the lesson.He wasn't shedding any pounds.He disclosed his daily consumption of jelly beans, revealing that he had consumed half a pound of the food and sharing it with his coach.He says: 'They don\u2019t have any fat.The sugar they provided was sufficient to prevent him from shedding an ounce.Additives are created from nonfat foods.The inclusion of these in our diet leads to an increase in calorie intake and weight gain.A study conducted by Pennsylvania State University confirmed that.During breakfast, Prof.Two groups of women were given yogurt by Barbara Rolls, which had the same number of calories.The label on the yogurt belongs to one group and displays \"high fat\" while the other group uses \"low fat.\"The \"low fat\" yogurt group consumed a significantly larger amount of calories during their later days than the other group.Richard Mattes, a nutrition researcher at Purdue University, suggests that people believe they have shed some pounds and can indulge in their meals later in the day without any negative consequences.\"When they do that, they tend to overcompute their compensation.\"", "question": "What can you infer from the text ?choose between the following alphabet:A.To keep from being overweight, people have to eat nofat food.B.The calories from fat just do it a little quicker than from protein and carbohydrates.C.People should avoid temptation.D.Americans realize that it is necessary to count calories before eating the food.", "groundTruth": [["Americans realize that it is necessary to count calories before eating the food"]], "answer": "people should avoid temptation.", "modAnswer": "the calories from fat just do it a little quicker than from protein and carbohydrates.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": []},{"test case number": 471, "context": "Extract 1A computer is an \"information processor\".It is given information,called \"data\",instructed to do certain things and then show us the results.The data put into the computer is called the\"input\" and the results which come out are the \"output\".Some people say the circle of large standing stones at Stonechenge is a kind of computer.Prehistory people worked out their calendar from the position of the shadows made by the sun shining on the stones.Extract 2Teach yourself new subjects and skills at your own pace with a home computer.Use it to help with schoolwork,for self-improvement,even to improve your career skills.Learn touchtyping.

Just how much depends on the location and length of the position, but you should budget for somewhere between PS1,500 and PS6,000.\"Having to pay to volunteer may sound paradoxical  , but it's the best way to ensure you get a position that benefits the local community while matching your interests and skills,\" explains Cusack.  \"You can also discuss the time you want to commit to a project --- many positions can fit into a holiday or even a weekend.\"", "modContext": "Do you feel like giving up?Are you tired of seeing hungry, homeless people on TV and want to do something about it?Have you ever considered volunteering abroad but ultimately decided against it because of factors like age, family situation, and inability to commit to enough time to do so?If that's the case, then you need to reconsider.According to David Stitt, the managing director of Gap Year for Grown Ups, volunteering abroad has become more secure and socially acceptable in recent years.\"A decade ago, volunteering abroad posed financial and personal risks, but now there are several organizations that offer a secure and well-structured experience.\"Currently, universities and businesses encourage students and employees to volunteer abroad.Volunteering opportunities abroad are available to entire families, and agencies are increasing their hiring of disabled and retired individuals.A thriving \"humanitarian tourism\" sector has emerged.Volunteering in foreign countries this year is expected to be a popular activity among UK citizens.Kevin Cusack, who runs a volunteer advice agency, states that some volunteering jobs are more accessible than others.\"English fluent teachers find it easy to secure a teaching job without qualification, and those who enjoy working with children should consider child care.\"zxxk: If you like rainforests or women's rights, there are plenty of volunteer positions that fit your fancy.Unless you possess the necessary skills and have expended time working in overseas development, it will be costly.The amount you spend will vary depending on the position's length and location, but typically fall within the range of PS1,500 to PS6,000.Cusack suggests that volunteering through monetary means is the most effective way to connect with others while also catering to their interests and skills.\"You may consider arranging for your preferred time, as some job roles can be filled during a holiday or weekend.\"", "question": "What is the writer's attitude towards volunteer work?choose between the following alphabet:A.Critical..B.Unfavorable..C.Supportive..D.Disagreeable..", "groundTruth": [["Supportive."]], "answer": "Supportive..", "modAnswer": "Supportive..", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": []},{"test case number": 497, "context": "The size of the British Isles often leads people to think that the languages spoken in its countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are somewhat the same.
