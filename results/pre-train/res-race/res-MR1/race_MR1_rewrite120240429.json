He was in my graduation class.My mood grew increasingly melancholic, and I promptly concealed myself behind the closest shelving unit.I should have been familiar with his name.How many instances did I hear the same thing during a class role call?What is the count of conversations that took place in the hallways?It was effortless for me to recall his last name, \"Ricca\".In the town where I grew up, there lived a family that was both large and well-known.It was not possible for me to just use his surname and call him.I should have acknowledged that I didn't remember his name, which was not the case.Every person's name holds significance in their life.If you can't remember the name of a friend from your past, it's like forgetting what your wife loved; an embarrassing mistake.I speedily went through the alphabet, a tactic I devised for this particular occasion.Can you tell me about Abe?Adam, Andy, and Bob: No.\"No,\" Bill.Yes, of course.Bill's words were precise.It goes without saying that he is Bill.I cautiously walked around the shelves and conversed with him while he examined some motor oil cans.\"What's up, Bill?\"I offered my hand to him and he accepted with a friendly shake.We engaged in a bit of conversation and made light-hearted remarks about our college journeys.As I exited, I reached for his hand, reassured him of my good fortune, and gave him another happy hug.I was so happy to avoid another awkward encounter that I could see myself smiling as I paid the cashier and left the shop.A terrible thought flooded my mind as I smiled and strolled through the parking lot.Hi there, my name is John!What is the birthplace of Bill?Was that my brother?I was completely caught off guard by my actions.The thought of my mistake caused me to drop my jaw.Mrs. was unable to do so.One of Ricca's sons was referred to as \"Bill\".A settlement situated to the north of Boston was known as \"Billerica\".", "question": "We can infer from the passage that   _  .choose between the following alphabet:A.The writer must have experienced such embarrassment many times.B.The writer had difficulty remembering names because he was getting old.C.Running through the alphabet was always an effective way of remembering an acquaintance's name for the writer.D.Mrs. Ricca would have named one of her sons \"Bill\" if Billerica was not the name of a town north of Boston.", "groundTruth": [["The writer must have experienced such embarrassment many times"]], "answer": "the writer must have experienced such embarrassment many times.", "modAnswer": "the writer must have experienced such embarrassment many times.", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[0, 0.5071648359298706], [37, 0.49965059757232666], [16, 0.4525375962257385], [11, 0.43335622549057007], [38, 0.4010680019855499], [14, 0.3775886595249176], [13, 0.361797571182251], [17, 0.3517875075340271], [23, 0.34042954444885254], [1, 0.33439901471138], [8, 0.29599958658218384], [15, 0.2944107949733734], [20, 0.27916428446769714], [32, 0.27688121795654297], [2, 0.24021050333976746], [4, 0.23147276043891907], [36, 0.22675950825214386], [19, 0.2165779024362564], [12, 0.21325424313545227], [25, 0.21191295981407166], [31, 0.19913464784622192], [22, 0.18786576390266418], [18, 0.1776840090751648], [10, 0.16006046533584595], [33, 0.14975404739379883], [3, 0.14542008936405182], [35, 0.12791195511817932], [24, 0.11740700900554657], [5, 0.11061529815196991], [29, 0.09808385372161865], [28, 0.09537135064601898], [9, 0.09517452865839005], [6, 0.09437549114227295], [21, 0.055145226418972015], [27, 0.03883136436343193], [30, 0.035717837512493134], [34, 0.03557064011693001], [7, -0.03130190074443817], [26, -0.047161590307950974]]},{"test case number": 11, "context": "Last year, on report card day,my son and a group of his 13-year-old friends piled into the back seat of my car,ready for the last-day-of-school party at McDonald's.\"Jack got a laptop for getting straight A's,and Laurie got a cell-phone,\"one boy said.\"Oh,yeah,and Sarah got a MP3,and she's only in third grade,said another.\"And how about Brian?

You've done so much already. Thank you!\" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father's eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right. Now that he has enough money, he loves to give whenever he sees a need.But this was not always the case. Divorced from my mother when I was 11, my dad couldn't be around his kids as often as he would have liked. Money was also tight; even weekend visits were rare. However, my dad stayed in constant communication with us and made sure he was involved in our lives. Though he couldn't always be there in person, I knew he was only a phone call away. I could always make sure of that.Even now, almost 30 years later, I treasure knowing that I can pick up the phone and call Dad, and he'll be there for me. I have a wonderful husband, but that hasn't changed how Dad sees me. I'm still his child and he loves to see that my needs are met.I remember a time when I was shopping in a hardware store   with Dad. I mentioned my plans to paint one wall in my house. Well, that's all it took for Dad to take action.

My parents and my teachers saw something in me--a potential to live, you might call it--which I didn't see, and they made me want to fight it out with blindness.The hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself. That was basic. If I hadn't been able to do that, I would have collapsed   and _ for the rest of my life. When I say belief in myself I am not talking about simply the kind of self confidence that helps me down an unfamiliar staircase alone. That is part of it. But I mean something bigger than that: an assurance  that I am, despite imperfections, a real, positive person; that somewhere in the sweeping, intricate  pattern of people there is a special place where I can make myself fit.It took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance. It had to start with the simplest things. Once a man gave me an indoor baseball. I thought he was making fun of me and I was hurt. \"I can't use this.\" I said. \"Take it with you,\" he urged me, \"and roll it around.\" The words stuck in my head. \"Roll it around! \"By rolling the ball I could hear where it went. This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible: playing baseball. At Philadelphia's Overbrook School for the Blind I invented a successful variation of baseball. We called it ground ball.All my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them, one at a time. I had to learn my limitations. It was no good to try for something I knew at the start was wildly out of reach because that only invited the bitterness of failure. I would fail sometimes anyway but on the average I made progress.", "modContext": "At the age of four, I was blinded when I fell off a box car in stifle yard in Atlantic City and hit my head.I am currently thirty-two years old.The color red and the radiance of sunshine are both familiar to me.It would be wonderful to see it again, but a catastrophe can have unexpected effects on people.Recently, I contemplated the idea that my experience of love might not have been as profound if I weren't blind.My faith in life has grown stronger.I am uncertain that I would have believed in it so much, otherwise.I'm not suggesting that I would rather be without my eyes.My intention was to appreciate what I still had, as the loss of them made me feel more grateful.It is my belief that life demands a continuous adjustment to reality.The more easily a person can make these adjustments, the more significant their personal life becomes.The adjustment is never a simple task.The combination of my confusion and fear left me feeling completely terrified.Nonetheless, I was fortunate.I was unable to see my potential and my parents and teachers convinced me that I had the ability to live, leading me to fight against blindness.I had to learn the hard way to believe in myself.That was a straightforward matter.The absence of that could have resulted in my collapse and lifelong disability.The belief in one's own abilities is not limited to the confidence that aids in climbing a stranger staircase.That is a constituent of it.However, my significance extends beyond that to the fact that I am a genuine person, even with flaws;There is a particular spot within the vast, intricate hierarchy of people where I can fit in.It took me years to uncover and validate this conviction.The initial steps were limited to the simplest.I was given an indoor baseball by a man in the past.I believed he was mocking me, and I felt betrayed.\"This is useless to me.\"\"I expressed,\"He advised me to \"take it with me\" and move it around.I couldn't get rid of those words.\"Don't be scared off!\"rolling the ball, I could hear where it went.I gained insight into how to succeed in playing baseball, which was previously a difficult endeavor.A popular type of baseball was created by me at the Overbrook School for the Blind in Philadelphia.We referred to it as ground

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it's one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying\"It got lost\"to\"I lost it\". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.George Bernard Shaw once said,\"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\"\"Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,\"said Albert Schweitzer.The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.\"It's not my responsibility,\"said the nurse,\"because it's a large puddle  .\"The housekeeper didn't agree.\"Well, it's not mine,\"she said,\"the puddle is too small.\"The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.\"Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?\"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.", "modContext": "What is a word that is both tedious and uninteresting?The word \"response\" has been used by authority figures so many times that it has become a synonym for discipline.Yet, it's a crucial element in maturing and feeling satisfied with your life.It is essential to have a foundation in every personal development book.It is said that the line between childhood and adulthood is blurred when we transition from \"It got lost\" to \"it was gone\".Acknowledging the significance of responsibility and acknowledging the impact of our choices are crucial indicators of emotional and moral maturity.Responsibility is a crucial element of good character.A lot of individuals have been avoiding the responsibility of growing up and evading the consequences.It is true that taking on responsibility can lead to unpleasant or frightening situations.To achieve our goals, we must demonstrate self-reliance, prepare for the future, and exercise discipline.The benefits of accepting responsibility are more significant than the temporary advantages of not doing so.Avoiding responsibility is not a means of improving one's life.Irresponsibility is a form of self-imposed dependence that requires conformity to both the circumstances and others.According to George Bernard Shaw, individuals are always blaming their circumstances.I don't put my trust in things.Those who enter this world are the ones who look for the ideals they seek and, if they can't find them, create them.According to Albert Schweitzer, it is crucial for man to relinquish his problems to his surroundings and reassess his ability to exercise his will, which is his personal responsibility in matters of faith and morals.Bernard L. is the individual at fault for blaming others and not accepting complete accountability.Brown, Jr.At one point, the worker was working in a hospital where patients' cups of water spilled on the floor beside their beds.The patient was worried about the possibility of slipping on the water if he left the bed and asked a nurse to clean it up.Even though the patient was unaware, the hospital policy stipulated that nurse-led cleanup was responsible for minor spills, while larger ones were taken care of by the housekeeping team.The nurse contacted the housekeeping team upon realizing that the spill was of significant magnitude.The spill was described as being small by a housekeeper who arrived.An argument ensued.The nurse declared that it was not their responsibility, \"because it's a massive puddle.\"\"The housekeeper was against it.\"\"I don't have it,\" she replied, acknowledging that the puddle was too small.\"The furious patient listened attentively before pouring the entire thing onto the floor using a pitcher of water from his nightstand.\"The puddle is big enough for you two to decide?\"He inquired.\"The argument concluded after it was over.Our ability to respond to circumstances and choose the attitudes, actions, and reactions that shape our lives is a crucial aspect of responsibility.The idea of power involves us being the ones in control.Only when we start being self-reliant and open to the vastness of our existence can we truly appreciate it.The only way to gain more control over your life, freedom, and independence is by taking responsibility.Responsible individuals are not only dependent on themselves, but also demonstrate their dependability to others.", "question": "What can we learn about

Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.George Bernard Shaw once said,\"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\"\"Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,\"said Albert Schweitzer.The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.\"It's not my responsibility,\"said the nurse,\"because it's a large puddle  .\"The housekeeper didn't agree.\"Well, it's not mine,\"she said,\"the puddle is too small.\"The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.\"Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?\"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

The thunder of their hooves   rings in the riders' ears, nearly drowning out the cheering of the crowd. After three or four minutes of suspense, one horse crosses the finish line first, winning the Melbourne Cup and earning a place in history.The horses that compete in the Melbourne Cup--one of the world's most famous horseraces--were fated to race. Bred for speed, these horses are the few that were singled out as having potential to become champions.Preparing a racehorse to compete requires a team. A horse's owner manages the team and decides which races to enter. A trainer determines the racehorse's diet and exercise. Regular exercise makes a horse less likely to be injured, but overtraining tires the horse. A groomer   cares for the racehorse and reports any problems he discovers to the trainer. And of course, no horserace could be run without a rider. These riders train for long hours and travel constantly from one race to another. They need to make a strategy, adapt to changing conditions and communicate with their horse to guide it to victory.Australia's most famous horserace, the Melbourne Cup, is 3,200 meters of pure excitement. Each year 300 or 400 horses are nominated  , but only 24 can run. The competitors are chosen based on a number of factors, but winners of certain races qualify automatically.Each racehorse receives a handicap--a certain weight it must carry to give each horse an equal chance of winning--two months before the race. Originally, horses that seemed likely to win were assigned larger handicaps. But the rules have changed, reducing the handicap for previous winners.The first Melbourne Cup in 1861 drew a crowd of 4,000 spectators, and the race's popularity has grown since then.
