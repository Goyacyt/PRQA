As the phrase goes, sometimes you do have to \"stop and smell the roses\".Although you may think that this is just a fancy way of saying taking some time to enjoy life, perhaps we have dismissed roses for too long. Seriously, you should pay more attention to those roses. They could greatly improve your life. That is, if you are one of the millions of people in the US who suffer from arthritis diseases.Result from two different arthritis studies have proved that an active ingredient of rose hips has been shown to protect and possibly rebuild joint tissue broken down by arthritis.

mind. Everyone gave it their all.And I hate admitting it, but I was an exception. I did not do my best. Not for the ribbon exercise, nor for the club exercise. Knowing that I could have reached a little further to catch my ribbon, focused a little more so the stick wouldn't slip through my fingers, tried a little harder to clean up those errors, but I didn't, still bothers me.After my disappointing competition, I tried my best to keep my eyes dry. But soon tears burned the edges of my eyes, and as I blinked, the first tear rolled down my cheek. Even though I angrily wiped my tears away before she looked at me, the evidence of my self-pity session presented itself clearly in the form of dirty makeup and reddened eyes.My mom hated to see me cry, especially because I had no right or reason to. I had messed up--that wasn't anyone's fault but mine--and crying wouldn't help at all. \"Why are you crying, Amanda?\" she asked, perhaps more pointedly   than intended, but I heard the concern in her voice. Unable to form all the emotions into words, I just looked away and avoided her questions.\"Tell me now why you're crying.\" Her voice this time wasn't as gentle as it was before; it was filled with frustration and impatience. \"Why are you crying?\" she whispered again, but this time her voice was shaky and flooded with pain. This was the first time I'd ever seen my mom cry; my mom, who was always so strong and was there to encourage me through the roughest times, was now crying, and I was the reason for it. Finding my voice, I tentatively asked, \"Why are you crying?\"She looked at me and answered exactly what I was afraid to hear, \"I hate to see you hurting yourself.\" So it was my fault.

When and how should tips be given? Generally, you should plan to tip your room steward   $3.00 to $3.50 per person, per day, and plan an equal amount for your dining room waiter, and half of that for the busboy . On most ships, tip the maitre d'  or dining room captain only if you ask for special favors or table-side service; $5 to $10 is normal. Barmen and wine stewards are tipped 10 to 15 percent, but many cruise lines will add this tip to your bar or drink bill. Check the bill to see how it is handled. Also, tips for special services such as salon && spa treatments and room service are left to the guest, depending on services offered. Sometimes tips are placed in envelopes from your cabin's stationery supply. Generally, passengers on cruises of 10 days or less will tip at the end of the cruise; on longer voyages, tipping weekly. As part of a new trend that seems likely to grow, Carnival, Holland America, Norwegian, Princess and Cunard now charge tips to your account  . Norwegian, for example, charges $10 per day, per guest, to cover service in the various dining rooms and your room steward. If you feel this amount needs to be increased or decreased, arrangements can be made onboard the ship, generally at the end of your cruise.

But plants? I've never considered the possibility of plant intelligence.  The idea seems absurd .Yet I've had friends argue that plant intelligence might exist. \"What are the differences between plants and animals?\" they ask, and then they argue about certain species that seem to share the intelligence of both plants and animals. New research suggests that plants communicate via \"networks\". Plant communication is not idea, and cannot indicate that it is a kind of intelligence, but it is still interesting.Recent research from Vidi researcher Josef Stuefer at the Radboud University Nijmegen shows that plants have their own chat systems that they can use to warn each other. Therefore plants are not boring and passive organisms that just stand there waiting to be cut down or eaten up. Many plants form internal communication networks and are able to exchange information networks and are able to exchange information efficiently.Many herbal plants such as strawberries and clovers  naturally form networks. Individual plants remain connected with each other for a certain period of time by means of runners (plant stems that grow along the ground and put down roots to form new plants). These connections enable the plants to share information with each other via internal channels. They are therefore very similar to computer networks. But what do plants chat to each other about?Recently Stuefer and hus colleagues were the first to prove that clover plants warn each other via the network links if danger is nearby. If one of the plants is attacked by caterpillars  , the other members of the network are warned via an internal signal.

This morning I wake up suddenly, like the alarm clock in my head has given me a little electric shock; it isn't sunny outside. I pull back the curtains and the sky is dark grey. Hearing my brother is getting up, I go downstairs to make him a cup of tea. He's down in the kitchen about five minutes later, wearing his work clothes, eyes mostly closed against the morning. \"Morning.\" I say. \"Uh huh.\" I leave him to work out what he is going to eat and go back to my room, and get back beneath the quilt . This morning I want to think a while. Today is Dad's birthday; Mom won't mention it. My brother might, just to _ , so I'll keep him sweet when he comes in from work. Every year on my dad's birthday I draw a picture of him; each year he looks a bit different. I'm an artist. It's not that I draw a straighter line or a truer circle, as they try to teach us to do at school. I just get the message across more clearly than other people. More truthfully. I know it.I read a lot of books too, mainly about artists, and I try to paint like them. When my dad comes back I'll be able to say \"this is you when I was twelve and I was in love with Monet\" or \"this is you on your thirty-eighth birthday, when I was fourteen, and you'd been gone five years, and I wanted to paint like Dante Gabriel Rossetti.\" And he'll look at each painting and know that I love him and never forget him. On Saturday mornings he'd take me to town and I'd drag him around the art shops. On my sixth birthday he bought me a box of 99 crayons. On my eighth birthday he bought me an easel  , a real one, not a kiddie's. On my ninth birthday he bought me oils. Some mornings I'd wake up and there'd be a book on my pillow about Picasso, or Chagall.\"Draw me,\" he'd say. \"Aw, Dad, I can't.\"I know I should go to school; I'm not one of those kids who are scared to go. But, it's my dad's birthday and I think I must spend it with him. So I spend some time thinking about his hair, which I think is probably no more grey than it was last year; I know hair doesn't age at the same speed every year, but I make his hair longer this year. And in my mind's eye I give him an extra few pounds too. But I keep the smile fixed in my head, like it is when he's happy. It's head and shoulders, so I'll put him in a T-shirt that shows his neck and throat and how strong he is and how brightly his eyes shine and how his eyebrows are dead level straight and still black.

Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children.The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes  were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes.In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others.The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation.

Functional it may be, but it is a bit of a trick, too.", "modContext": "Is style a viable fashion statement?Why is the appearance of a product more crucial than its functionality?The dispute over form and function resurfaced when James Dyson, the British inventor of the Dvson vacuum cleaner that has sold millions worldwide, stepped down as chairman of London's Design Museum.It is widely accepted that Mr.The museum's emphasis on style, as perceived by Dyson, was being matched against serious industrial design.Mr.The museum was accused by Dyson of not being true to its own identity.While he may be correct, museums worldwide are no longer afforded exceptional places to learn and study.They must use exhibitions of populist culture, attractive cafes and shops, or a new Frank Gehry building as the best way to attract more visitors in competition for sponsorship.Some manufacturers may be too conservative and overly fixated on product engineering and the functionality of their products.However, there are those who believe that a product's appearance is of greater significance.Design encompasses both function and form in a broad sense.The norm is for the former to become the latter in any given product category.Clothing serves as an illustration.It's unlikely that someone would consider the appearance of an object to be more significant than its function.Nowadays, almost every commodity performs a comparable job at any price.The only way for producers to differentiate their products from competitors is by creating an emotional connection with consumers, whether it be through the product's appearance or packaging.What is your opinion on the Dyson vacuum cleaner?Mr.Although Dyson may think that people buy these machines because they have better suction graphs, most vacuum cleaners perform well; nevertheless.A popular brand like Dyson is the primary reason why people pay more for their vacuum cleaner.With its workings being visible, it resembles a Richard Rogers building in that all of its pipes are showcased in bright colors on the outside, rather than hidden inside.While functional, it is also somewhat of a deception.", "question": "What is the author's attitude towards the form of a product?choose between the following alphabet:A.Optimistic..B.Doubtful..C.Disapproving..D.Objective..", "groundTruth": [["Objective."]], "answer": "Optimistic..Disapproving..", "modAnswer": "Optimistic..Disapproving..", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[1, 0.3624725341796875], [16, 0.34528547525405884], [10, 0.3432040810585022], [9, 0.2894229590892792], [5, 0.28289595246315], [18, 0.28289595246315], [11, 0.25779131054878235], [3, 0.2061416506767273], [22, 0.19383323192596436], [12, 0.19034680724143982], [14, 0.16439422965049744], [19, 0.1514461636543274], [6, 0.14456316828727722], [0, 0.14432500302791595], [4, 0.13855943083763123], [8, 0.12273077666759491], [7, 0.1078978031873703], [17, 0.10200721025466919], [2, 0.09393474459648132], [13, 0.08309368789196014], [20, 0.04744613170623779], [21, -0.06803655624389648], [15, -0.09036944806575775]]},{"test case number": 139, "context": "There are three different kinds of friends in our life.

The bite of the mosquito can be deadly. The insects carry serious diseases like malaria  . It is estimated that almost 630,000 people died from malaria and malariarelated causes in 2012, and most of these cases were in African countries.In the United States, a group of California scientists are working to develop a more effective and less costly substance   to protect people from mosquitoes. The researchers are investigating the sense of smell in mosquitoes. They found the insects use the same _ for identifying carbon dioxide in human breath as they do for the smell of our skin.

The university has now applied for a patent  application to secure the only rights to the technique.Professor Allen and his team have created a system to use medium wave frequencies to replace batteries in small everyday devices like clocks and remote controls.The new technique uses the \"waste\" energy of radio waves and has been developed as part of the university's research into \"power harvesting\".

The program, called Project BudBurst, collects life cycle data on different kinds of common plants from across the prefix = st1 /United States.\"People don 't have to be plant experts-they just have to look around and see what's in their neighbourhood,\"says Jennifer Schwartz, an adviser with the project, \"As we collect this data, we'll be able to predict how plants and communities of plants and animals will respond as the climate changes.\" That data will help scientists predict not only how natural communities may change but also how these changes will affect people.Scientists monitoring lilac   flowering in the western United States reported that in years when lilacs bloomed early - before May 20th-wildfires later in the summer and fall are larger and more severe.  _ , Jennifer says.Improved monitoring is an important step toward predicting how natural communities will respond to climate change.\"The best way for us to increase our knowledge of how plants and animals are responding to climate change is to increase the amount of data we have,\" he says. \"That 's why we need citizen scientists to get as much information from as many places on as many species over as long a time period as we can.\"", "modContext": "The impact of climate change on nature is evident.Monitoring important life cycle events like flowering, the emergence of leaves, and the first frog calls of spring is essential to comprehend it globally.Due to the inability of scientists to be present everywhere, they are turning to non-scientists, also known as citizen scientists.Scientists and educators established the National Phenology Network last year.Scientists use the term \"phenology\" to describe their investigation into the timing of natural phenomena.The group's first-ever effort to collect data on plant flowering and leafing requires input from both scientists and non-scientists every year.Project BudBurst is a program that collects life cycle data on various common plants from across the prefix = st1 /United States.Jennifer Schwartz, an adviser for the project, suggests that individuals can simply observe their surroundings without being plant experts.

The theories of modem psychology have stepped in to argue that we must understand the need of children. Children are not just small adults; they are children who must be respected as much.Well, you may say, this is as it should be, a good idea. But think further. What happens? \"Education\" becomes the responsibility not of teachers, but of psychologists  . What happens then? Teachers worry too much about the psychological implications   of their lessons, and forget about the subjects themselves. If a child dislikes a lesson, the teacher feels that it is his fault, not the child's. So teachers worry whether history is \"relevant\" to modern young children. And do they dare to recount stories about violence? Or will this make the children themselves violent? Can they tell their classes about children of different races, or will this encourage racial hatred? Why teach children to write grammatical sentences? Verbal expression is better. Sums? Arithmetic? No: Real-life mathematical situations are more understandable.You see, you can go too far.

has revealed.It's possible that you are also interpreting it differently.A new study suggests that your perception of the world may be influenced by your mood.The way we perceive colors may be influenced by sadness, as demonstrated by researchers.Psychology researcher Christopher Thorstenson from the University of Rochester and his team found that individuals with a sad mood were less accurate in identifying colors on the blue-yellow axis than those who were not sad.Thorstenson stated that color was already commonly used to describe everyday events, such as mood, even when these ideas appear to be unrelated.\"We speculated that the connection between mood and identifying colors could have been one explanation for these metaphors.\"It's not the first time that a depressed mood has led to different recognition,' Thorstenson and others say.The correlation between colors and mood was first demonstrated by Emanuel Bubl and his team at Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg in Germany in 2010.A paper authored by Johnson Fam from the University of Singapore in 2013 provided support for this.Two studies were carried out by the team.During the first phase, 127 participants were assigned to view two video clips that had been proven to induce feelings of sadness or amusement in previous studies.They didn't execute that step in a particular way.The entire group was instructed to identify the colors in 48 consecutive color transformations.Those who watched the sad video were significantly worse at distinguishing colors along the blue-yellow line.A total of 130 individuals were chosen to watch a sad or neutral video in the second study.Compared to the neutral group, the sadness group was less proficient at identifying colors along the blue-yellow line.",

I'm eighty-three years old now. I once knew the greatest man in England. William Shakespeare was his name. I first met William near a big field of apple trees in the town named Stratford in October, 1579. He told me he was 15 years old. He was two years older than me. He had a sister, Joan, and two younger brothers, Gilbert and Richard. And the next year he had another brother, Edmund. After William's parents died, he and his sister lived with his mother's brother. I became his friend from that day until he died. We met nearly every day. We were friends for thirty years.I once worked with him in the theatre, through the good times and the bad times. William was good at acting. He could make all kinds of people pleased. By 1592, he became very famous. He was always busy day and night. I don't know when he slept. He not only acted in plays, but also wrote his own plays. In his whole life, William wrote 37 plays in all. He was the best  _ in England.He wrote a play about love in 1595. It was Romeo and Juliet. He once used my name, Toby, in his play--Twelfth Night.

The day was founded in 1999 to celebrate the incredible companionship dogs provide and to encourage animal adoption.Dogs have been having their day for some time now. Everywhere you look, there is some kind of pet-project going on, which for a dog lover like me, is a dream come true.There are dogs starring in reality TV. Doggy day care is in high demand. Big well-known companies like Paul Mitchell, Omaha Steaks, and Harley Davidson have all jumped on the gravy-train   offering pet products including shampoos, food and clothes. The pet insurance business is booming. And, luxury hotels and apartment buildings are also catering to our furry friends, finally.Make no bones about it, the pet industry is a multi-billion dollar business. According to the American Pet Products Association, 62 percent households in the U.S. own a pet. It's estimated that owners will spend about $55.5 billion on goods and services for their pets this year, up about $2 billion from last year.That's a small price to pay for the unconditional love and loyalty you get from a pet. The bond between dog and dog owner began about 30,000 years ago when dogs started to become domesticated  .

Carefully holding her blouse away from her body, she continued to iron it while she was wearing it. It seemed like a logical answer to an urgent problem.And it seemed to be working until Janelle tried to iron the collar and accidentally ironed her neck by mistake.

It was said that Leonardo often painted continuously from dawn to night without eating his meals. But at other times he spent hours before the picture, lost in contemplation, examining, comparing, and measuring his figures.This inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior, the head of the church, who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems, the more he accomplishes; and so he tried to find fault with the idle  painter.

What are the causes of this phenomenon and what problems has it brought to families and society as a whole?In this day and age, the human society is progressing rapidly on various aspects. Many modern technologies were invented by human such as cars, computers and Internet. But advances in technology lead to our pace of life much faster than before. People have not enough time with their family.It is evident that the causes of this phenomenon are different. In the first place, advancing in technology improves the efficiency of production, but also causes people to do more things at the same time. Moreover, this is especially true when we consider the fact that the global financial crisis in recent years has led many people to fear losing their job, and the significant rising costs of life which need people to work harder than before. Besides, employees may be scattered at the whole world. For example, my friend often holds a meeting at middle-night with his colleague who stays in the US and he still needs to work at daytime.In my opinion, the impact of this phenomenon on families and society is profound. People do not have enough time to spend with their family, especially with their children. They may spend much time in front of TV or computer games which have much violence and may seriously influence children's growth.

He arrested me right then and there.The policeman drove me to a police station 20 minutes from my home. He called my parents and told them where I was.I went to court two months after that, charged with refusing to obey an officer. I got a $700 (4,340 yuan) fine and 40 hours of community service.

These worked relatively well until recent years, when aging population growth in places like the United States and Western Europe began to gradually weaken the systems finances. These nations now face some tough choices. Mr. Lee says the elderly in some of these countries must either receive less money, retire later or increase taxes to make the system continuable.Most developing nations haven't built this type of government-funded support, but have instead relied on families to care for their elderly. These nations also generally have a much younger population, which means their situation is not as urgent as more developed nations. But Mr. Lee says that doesn't mean they can ignore the issue. \"Third World countries should give very careful thought to this process, to population aging and how it may affect their economies -- now, before population aging even becomes an issue,\" he explained.", "modContext": "It is estimated by the United States that one in every 10 individuals worldwide is at least 60 years old.It's anticipated to make up one out of every five by 2050.The elderly population will be surpassed by a relatively small number of young people who can provide for them.The aging of the world has a significant impact on economics, as stated by Professor Richard Lee from the University of California at Berkeley.\"The cost of population aging is high due to its increased concentration in older age groups,\" he explained.As people age, they consume more and produce less.As people age, the cost could increase.Nevertheless, Mr.According to Lee, the controllable issue can be tackled by enhancing worker productivity and smart planning.Different societies provide care for the elderly, but each has a price tag.Three types of support are commonly observed.Older individuals can make do with the money they earned in their youth.They can choose to have their family take care of them or they can opt for the government.Governments of industrialized nations established publicly-funded support systems.The financial stability of the system was weakened in recent years due to the aging population growth in countries like the United States and Western Europe, which had previously been successful.These nations are now confronted with some tough choices.Mr.Lee suggests that in certain countries, the elderly must either receive less money, retire later, or raise taxes to maintain the system.Unlike most developing nations where government-funded support is scarce, many have relied on families to provide care for their elderly population.These nations tend to have a younger population, which means their situation is not as urgent as in more developed countries.Nevertheless, Mr.Lee asserts that they cannot ignore the matter.He suggested that Third World nations should be cautious about the effects of population aging on their economies before it becomes a concern.", "question": "We can infer from the text that developing nations.choose between the following alphabet:A.should prepare for population aging.B.don't see population aging as an issue.C.are facing urgent situations of population aging.D.have better ways to deal with population aging.", "groundTruth": [["should prepare for population aging"]], "answer": "should prepare for population aging.B.are facing urgent situations of population aging.C", "modAnswer": "should prepare for population aging.B.are facing urgent situations of population aging.C", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[19, 0.5919303894042969], [22, 0.5637482404708862], [5, 0.4699417054653168], [18, 0.4653165936470032], [17, 0.4038339853286743], [4, 0.37315329909324646], [14, 0.36096954345703125], [15, 0.3575242757797241], [0, 0.35038888454437256], [2, 0.3302457928657532], [9, 0.3241971731185913], [3, 0.2793942391872406], [1, 0.2426992952823639], [13, 0.23779907822608948], [12, 0.2283381223678589], [6, 0.21552114188671112], [11, 0.2025834172964096], [8, 0.18207716941833496], [21, 0.1685355305671692], [7, 0.16717155277729034], [20, 0.16717155277729034], [16, 0.16099435091018677], [10, 0.13573884963989258]]},{"test case number": 352, "context": "I am 26.

This construction work went on for five centuries! If all the roads built during the Roman Empire were put together end to end, they would circle the equator twice.The network of Roman roads was begun in 312 BC. It was demanded that the roads be built strong so that they would not fall down. Roman soldiers, supervised   by engineers, laid down the roads in a special pattern of layers. The first layer was made of sand. Next, the builders added rocks and rubble. On top of these materials came gravel. On this solid foundation, the road builders placed paving stones.Also, Roman roads were cambered. This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.All Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile).

How do you decide on a school when there are thousands of them to pick from? Start by asking yourself questions about your preferences:What are my strengths?1.Am I interested in liberal arts or science or business?2.What kind of learning environment is best for me?3.Would I be more comfortable in a small school or a large one?4.Do I want to stay close to home or live far away?5.Would I prefer to be in a city environment or a small college town?6.Do I like being with people who are mostly like me or do I want to meet a different group?Ask friends and older people who are in college about their schools and about other schools they're familiar with. Talk to one of your teachers and go to college fairs when they visit your town.Once you've narrowed down your choices, ask the schools to send you related materials and visit their websites. When you've cut your list down to a manageable number, make arrangements to visit.

However, by 2100, spaceship can travel at half the speed of light. It might take us two or three days to get to Mars!Secondly, humans need food, water and air to live. Scientists should be able to develop plants that can be grown on Mars. These plants will produce the food and air that we need. However, can these plants produce water for us ? There is no answer now.There is a problem for us to live on Mars. Mars pulls us much less than the Earth does. This will be dangerous because we could easily jump too high and fly slowly away into space. To prevent this, humans on Mars have to wear special shoes to make themselves heavier.Life on Mars will be better than that on Earth in many ways, People will have more space. Living in a large building with only 10 bedrooms is highly possible. Many people believe that robot will do most of our work, so we have more time for our hobbies.There will probably be no school on Mars. Every student will have a computer at home which is connected to the internet. They can study, do their homework and take exams in online schools. Each student will also have their own online teacher called \"e-teacher\".However, in some ways, life on Mars may not be better than that on the earth today. Food will not be the same -- meals will probably be in the form of pills and will not be as delicious as they are today, Also, space travel will make many people feel ill. The spaceship will travel fast but the journey to Mars will probably be very uncomfortable.", "modContext": "It is presently challenging to envision, but there are numerous individuals who believe that we will inhabit Mars by 2100.The Earth is becoming more and more contaminated.Fortunately, we can start over and construct a more favorable world on Mars.This is how life might be.Firstly, the transportation system needs to be improved greatly.Our spaceships are currently too slow to transport a significant number of people to Mars, which takes several months.By 2100, spaceships will be able to travel at twice the speed of light.In two or three days, we could be on Mars!Humans require food, water, and air to sustain their existence.It is possible for scientists to cultivate plants on Mars.These plants will be responsible for producing food and air.Is it feasible for these plants to provide us with water?The question remains unanswered.The task of residing on Mars poses a challenge for us.The Earth has a much greater pull on Mars than we do.It poses a risk as we could jump too high and fly slowly into space.To avoid this, humans on Mars must wear specialized shoes to increase their weight.Mars will offer more opportunities for life than Earth in many ways, and there will be more space available to humans.A large building with only 10 bedrooms is a prime location for living.The notion that robots will take care of most of our tasks means we have more time to devote to our leisure activities.It is likely that there will be no educational facilities on Mars.A connected internet computer will be provided to every student at home.They have the option to study, complete their homework, and take online exams.A teacher named \"e-teacher\" will be created for each student's online platform.Life on Mars may not be as abundant as it is on earth today, in certain respects.There is no guarantee that the food we eat will be as delicious as it is now, and people who go on space missions may feel unwell due to the pills they consume.Although the spaceship will move quickly, the journey to Mars is expected to be a very uncomfortable experience.", "question": "According to the text, which of the following about Mars is NOT true ?choose between the following alphabet:A.Transport will be much better and faster..B.We need to develop a special plant which can produce water..C.Food will be much more tasty..D.On Mars, we can jump higher than on the earth..", "groundTruth": [["Food will be much more tasty."]], "answer": "On Mars, we can jump higher than on the earth.", "modAnswer": "Food will be much more tasty..D.On Mars, we can jump higher than on", "delete sentence number": [], "distance value": [[17, 0.6167151927947998], [24, 0.6129554510116577], [14, 0.5949101448059082], [9, 0.5840440988540649], [13, 0.5492404103279114], [2, 0.540622889995575], [16, 0.5189101099967957], [7, 0.4518737196922302], [26, 0.4376523494720459], [0, 0.4122388958930969], [25, 0.39699119329452515], [5, 0.37479299306869507], [20, 0.362700879573822], [10, 0.2929939925670624], [4, 0.29255011677742004], [11, 0.2917255759239197], [8, 0.27187615633010864], [1, 0.26166099309921265], [15, 0.21117523312568665], [12, 0.1341537982225418], [6, 0.13219507038593292], [19, 0.10245491564273834], [3, 0.09022068977355957], [18, 0.014291582629084587], [22, -0.039823003113269806], [23, -0.050150029361248016], [21, -0.08258125185966492]]},{"test case number": 440, "context": "If you win the $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot  , you may not be as lucky as you think.

On Aug. 4, Graham and Sheryl Anley, while boating off the coast of South Africa, hit a rock. As the boat threatened to sink, the husband got off, but his wife was trapped in the boat. Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine.  It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first.  We have strange relationships with our pets. We look after our pets with great love and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the kind treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps.  A recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog? Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.   What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.

On Aug. 4, Graham and Sheryl Anley, while boating off the coast of South Africa, hit a rock. As the boat threatened to sink, the husband got off, but his wife was trapped in the boat. Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine.  It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first.  We have strange relationships with our pets. We look after our pets with great love and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the kind treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps.  A recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog? Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.   What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.  We prison people who abuse animals, put ourselves in harm's way in boats between whales and whalers and show sympathy to Bambi and his mother. We can extend sympathy to an animal and feel its pain like no other species. But let's not be too proud of ourselves.

And indeed,  cutting fat  to control or lose weight makes sense. Fat has nine calories per gram. Protein and carbohydrates  have just four. Moreover, the body uses fewer calories to metabolize fat than it does to metabolize other foods. Compared with protein and carbohydrates -- which break down into amino acids and simple sugars, respectively, and can be used to strengthen and energize the body ---- dietary fat is more easily converted to body fat. Therefore, it's more likely to stay on buttocks, thighs and bellies.But cutting fat from your diet doesn't necessarily mean your body won't store fat. For example, between nonfat and regular cookies, there's trivial difference in calories because manufacturers make up for the loss of fat by adding sugar. Low-fat crackers, soups and dressings can also be just as high in calories as richer versions. No matter where the calories come from, overeating will still cause weight again. The calories from fat just do it a little quicker. A Wisconsin computer programmer who decided with a diet coach to eat only 40 grams of fat a day learned the lesson firsthand. He wasn't losing weight. Then he showed his food diary to his coach and revealed he'd been eating half a pound of jelly beans a day. \"They don't have any fat,\" he explains. But they had enough sugar to keep him from shedding an ounce. Nonfat foods become add-on foods.

Bees are known as very hard workers. They appear to be busy, moving around their homes, or hives  . So you might say you were as busy as a bee if you spent your weekend cleaning your house. In fact, you might say your house was a beehive of activity if your whole family was helping you clean. You also might say you made a beeline for something if you went there right away. When we go to see a movie, my friend always makes a beeline for the place where they sell popcorn   .Here is an expression about bees that is not used much any more, but we like it anyway. We think it was first used in the 1920s. If something was the best of its kind, you might say it was the bee's knees. Now, we admit that we do not know how this expression developed. In fact, we do not even know if bees have knees!If your friend cannot stop talking about something because she thinks it is important, you might say she has a bee in her bonnet  . If  someone asks you a personal question, you might say \"that is none of your beeswax\".

At first, visitors are often surprised to find that they have difficulty in understanding the accents and dialects of certain regions. Even in England there are many different dialects.Experts believe that for most English people, the places they come from are very important to them. Accents are clues to where people were born and where they grew up. Although some people may change the way they speak during their lifetime, most people carry at least some evidence of their accents and dialects throughout their lives. In addition to the regional accents of England, there can also be class differences among the accents. People are often able to make instant and unconscious judgments about a stranger's class by listening to his or her accent.
