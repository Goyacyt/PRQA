I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well.

We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers?

With Orville flying first, the brothers took turns as pilot, and they flew three more times that day. On their fourth try, they managed to go 852 feet in 59 seconds ----an amazing feat at the time. The two brothers had invented powered flight. Orville and Wilbur Wright owned a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Although they had not gone to school to learn about airplanes or engineering, they were good mechanics. By repairing bicycles, they had learned how gears and pulleys worked. They also learned to take careful notes about what they saw. Each time they made a new design and tested a machine, they took notes and made drawings. They would study these to figure out what they could do better the next time.Before the Wright brothers flew, they did many things to prepare for this extraordinary achievement. They read everything they could find about air, balloons, and kites. Then they made careful sketches of what they wanted to build. They began by making model kites to learn how air flowed over wings. They made them bigger and bigger until they had a glider -- a kite that is big enough to hold a person, but with no engine. The Wright brothers made three gliders before building their first airplane. Each time they made a glider, they would test it, make careful observations, and then improve their design. When they made a glider that flew well, they added an engine. This step was harder than it sounds, because they had to find an engine that was both light-weight and powerful. The engines that they could buy were either too heavy or too weak, so they asked their friend Charlie Taylor to help them build one. The first engine that Charlie built broke almost immediately, but the second one worked well.   After Orville and Wilbur installed the engine in their plane, they were almost ready.

Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities.

Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it.

Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.It's been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying\"It got lost\"to\"I lost it\". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That's why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.George Bernard Shaw once said,\"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can't find them, make them.\"\"Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,\"said Albert Schweitzer.The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.\"It's not my responsibility,\"said the nurse,\"because it's a large puddle  .\"The housekeeper didn't agree.\"Well, it's not mine,\"she said,\"the puddle is too small.\"The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.\"Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?\"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.

Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.George Bernard Shaw once said,\"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are.

Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient's bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn't know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital's housekeeping group.The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed.\"It's not my responsibility,\"said the nurse,\"because it's a large puddle  .\"The housekeeper didn't agree.\"Well, it's not mine,\"she said,\"the puddle is too small.\"The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.\"Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?\"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver's seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent.

I felt like I was a somebody who had become a nobody.    I was 18 and had just graduated from high school, when my mum told me, \"You can't just depend on skating to make a living. You'd better find a job.\" I knew she was right. So I found a job at a restaurant where I waited at tables and did anything else that needed to be done. In fact, I worked so hard that I had never got the chance to have a break. No one cared that I had been an Olympic skater; I was judged only by how hard I worked.    That job taught me so many things. I learned, for example, how to deal with people. As an athlete, this was new to me. One day a man loudly called me over to his table and complained, \"This milk is sour. I am not drinking this junk! I want my money back! \" It was near the end of my shift   and I wanted to tell him how rude I thought he was. But I had learned that \"the customer is always right\" and a smile can go a long way. \"I'm really sorry, sir. I'll get you a free cup.\" I said with a smile. When I brought him his coffee, his attitude changed. And he left me a tip!    My first job taught me that it is important to do your best at anything you try. I knew nothing about being a waitress when 1 started my job but by the time I left when 1 decided to return to skating -- I had earned a raise and my boss's praise.

New research suggests that plants communicate via \"networks\". Plant communication is not idea, and cannot indicate that it is a kind of intelligence, but it is still interesting.Recent research from Vidi researcher Josef Stuefer at the Radboud University Nijmegen shows that plants have their own chat systems that they can use to warn each other. Therefore plants are not boring and passive organisms that just stand there waiting to be cut down or eaten up. Many plants form internal communication networks and are able to exchange information networks and are able to exchange information efficiently.Many herbal plants such as strawberries and clovers  naturally form networks. Individual plants remain connected with each other for a certain period of time by means of runners (plant stems that grow along the ground and put down roots to form new plants). These connections enable the plants to share information with each other via internal channels. They are therefore very similar to computer networks. But what do plants chat to each other about?Recently Stuefer and hus colleagues were the first to prove that clover plants warn each other via the network links if danger is nearby. If one of the plants is attacked by caterpillars  , the other members of the network are warned via an internal signal. Once warned the intact  plants strengthen their chemical and mechanicaicl resistance so that they are less attractive to advancing  caterpillars. Thanks to this early warning system, the plants can stay one step ahead of their attackers. The research has shown that this significantly limits the damage to the plants.Again, I don't believe this reflects intelligence,", "modContext": "I believe that animals possess greater intelligence than most people think.

The bite of the mosquito can be deadly. The insects carry serious diseases like malaria  . It is estimated that almost 630,000 people died from malaria and malariarelated causes in 2012, and most of these cases were in African countries.In the United States, a group of California scientists are working to develop a more effective and less costly substance   to protect people from mosquitoes. The researchers are investigating the sense of smell in mosquitoes. They found the insects use the same _ for identifying carbon dioxide in human breath as they do for the smell of our skin. Anandasankar Ray, who is leading the investigation, says scientists tested more than a million chemical compounds   until they found a substance called Ethyl Pyruvate. He says Ethyl Pyruvate makes the mosquitoes' receptors inactive. \"When we apply Ethyl Pyruvate to a human arm and offer it to hungry mosquitoes in a cage, very few of the mosquitoes are attracted to the human arm because only a few of them are able to smell it out,\" said Ray.Genevieve Tauxe, a member of the research team, says it was not easy to find the neurons   of noble cells that recognize both the smell of human breath and skin. \"With the device used to examine the mosquito, we are able to insert a very small electrode   into the part of the mosquito's nose, where its smelling neurons are and where the smell is happening,\" said Tauxe.Anandasankar Ray says a product based on Ethyl Pyruvate may cost less to produce than DEFT, the most effective chemical treatment now in use. He says DEFT is too costly for most people who live in areas affected by malaria.\"Perhaps by finding smells that can attack other target receptors, we will be able to improve upon DEFT and finally have the next generation of insect behaviour control products,\" said Ray.", "modContext": "The sound of a mosquito can mean trouble in many parts of the world.

The university has now applied for a patent  application to secure the only rights to the technique.Professor Allen and his team have created a system to use medium wave frequencies to replace batteries in small everyday devices like clocks and remote controls.The new technique uses the \"waste\" energy of radio waves and has been developed as part of the university's research into \"power harvesting\". Professor Allen said that as radio waves have energy---like light waves, sound waves or wind waves---in theory, these waves could be used to create power.\"The new area of power harvesting technology promises to reduce our reliance on conventional batteries,\" he said. \"It's really exciting way of taking power from sources other than what we would normally think of.\"The team is now waiting for the results of the patent application to secure recognition of the technique.
