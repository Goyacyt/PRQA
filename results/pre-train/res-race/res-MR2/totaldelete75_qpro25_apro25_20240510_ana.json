Context list:[[0, "I am a psychologist. I first met Timothy, a quiet, overweight eleven-year-old boy, when his mother brought him to me to discuss his declining grades. A few minutes with Timothy were enough to confirm that his self-esteem  and general happiness were falling right along with _ . I asked about Timothy's typical day. He awoke every morning at six thirty so he could reach his school by eight and arrived home around four thirty each afternoon. He then had a quick snack, followed by either a piano lesson or a lesson with his math tutor. He finished dinner at 7 pm, and then he sat down to do homework for two to three hours. Quickly doing the math in my head, I found that Timothy spent an average of thirteen hours a day at a writing desk.What if Timothy spent thirteen hours a day at a sewing machine instead of a desk? We would immediately be shocked, because that would be called children being horribly mistreated. Timothy was far from being mistreated, but the mountain of homework he faced daily resulted in a similar consequence --he was being robbed of his childhood. In fact, Timothy had no time to do anything he truly enjoyed, such as playing video games, watching movies, or playing board games with his friends.Play, however, is a crucial part of healthy child development. It affects children's creativity, their social skills, and even their brain development. The absence of play, physical exercise, and freefrom social interaction takes a serious toll on many children. It can also cause significant health problems like childhood obesity, sleep problems and depression.Experts in the field recommend the minutes children spend on their homework should be no more than ten times the number of their grade level. As a fifthgrader, Timothy should have no more than fifty minutes a day of homework (instead of three times that amount). Having an extra two hours an evening to play, relax, or see a friend would soundly benefit any child's life quality."], [3, 'From self-driving cars to carebots (care+robots) for elderly people, rapid development in technology has long represented a possible threat to many jobs normally performed by people. But experts now believe that almost 50 percent of occupations existing today will be completely unnecessary by 2025 as artificial intelligence continues to change businesses."The next fifteen years will see a revolution in how we work, and a revolution will necessarily take place in how we plan and think about workplaces," said Peter Andrew, Director of Workplace Strategy for CBRE Asia Pacific.A growing number of jobs in the future will require creative intelligence, social skills and the ability to use artificial intelligence.The report is based on interviews with 200 experts, business leaders and young people from Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. It shows that in the US technology already destroys more jobs than it creates.But the report states: "Losing occupations does not necessarily mean losing jobs -- just changing what people do." Growth in new jobs could occur as much, according to the research."The growth of 20 to 40 person companies that have the speed and technological know-how will directly challenge big companies," it states.A 2014 report by Pew Research found 52 percent of experts in artificial intelligence and robotics were optimistic about the future and believed there would still be enough jobs in the next few years. The optimists pictured "a future in which robots do not take the place of more jobs than they create," according to Aaron Smith, the report\'s co-author."Technology will continue to affect jobs, but more jobs seem likely to be created. Although there have always been unemployed people, when we reached a few billion people there were billions of jobs. There is no shortage of things that need to be done and that will not change," Microsoft\'s Jonathan Grudin told researchers.'], [6, 'Most people know that a wedding ring is symbolic of the bond  of love and commitment  between two people. But not everyone knows about the history behind this small yet powerful symbol. The history of the wedding ring goes back not just hundreds but thousands of years. No other currently practiced wedding tradition has been around as long.The Egyptians were the first recorded civilization to use the wedding ring. In Egyptianhieroglyphics  a circle represented _ . Once a woman accepted the ring she became the "property" of the person who gave it to her and she was in a sense "his." The first wedding ring could have been made of braided grass or hay (which would have been changed often), ivory, bone, or leather.  Eventually, metal was used, but the first wedding bands werecrude  and rough. However, the sentiment  remained the same-eternal commitment and love.The Egyptians wore the wedding ring on the left hand because it was believed that a vein  in the left hand went straight to the heart. This tradition is still commonly practiced today in most parts of the world largely for practical purposes (most people are right handed.)It is worn on the fourth finger of the left hand. But there are some countries and groups which do not follow this tradition.  In the Jewish faith, the wedding ring is put on the index finger. Roman Catholics traditionally wore their wedding band on the right hand, and in many countries and regions in Europe some people still follow this tradition.It is interesting to note that in the long history of the wedding ring that it is only in the last century that men have begun to wear them. However, now both men and women show their love and commitment by exchanging rings on their wedding day.Once you begin shopping for rings you may be amazed by the choices that await you. There are several different types of metals: traditional gold, white gold, platinum, and titanium. You can have an inscription  put on the inside of the band  if you like. Some people are even choosing a tattoo  band. The styles vary from a simple, yet elegant  band to an elaborate  ring covered with jewels. If you do not buy the wedding and engagement rings as a set you will want to be sure the styles are compatible . Choose carefully because this choice will need to stand the test of eternity.'], [9, 'I\'ve often had difficulty remembering names. Proper nouns seldom found easy purchase in my brain unless I consciously repeat them over and over again. Needless to say, when people leave my life their names are often soon forgotten. This can have some embarrassing consequences.Five or six years after high school graduation, I was reading carefully the shelves of a local auto supply shop when I noticed someone familiar enter the store. I knew him. He was in my graduation class and although he was not a good friend of mine, we had shared many classes and knew each other well. I began to feel an increasing sense of foreboding and quickly hid behind the nearest shelving unit. I should have known his name. How many times had I heard it during class role call? How many conversations had we had in the hallways?I easily remembered his surname, "Ricca". His was a large, well know family in the town of my childhood. I couldn\'t have just _ him using his surname. I might as well have admitted forgetting his name, which was not a choice. One\'s name is important to every person\'s identity. Not remembering an old acquaintance\'s name is similar to forgetting your wife\'s favourite flower, an embarrassing mistake of the highest order.I quickly ran through the alphabet  , a strategy I developed for just such an occasion. Abe? No, Adam, Andy, Bob? No, Bill? Yes! Bill sounded right. Of course, his name is Bill. I confidently made my way around the shelves and spoke to him as he was studying some cans of motor oil."Bill, how are you doing?", I said offering him my hand which he took with a friendly shake. We talked a bit, some amusing remarks about our college experiences and such. I took his hand again, said how good it was to see him and gave him a happy wave, calling him by name again, as I left.I was so pleased that I avoided yet another awkward encounter  that I could feel a big smile on my face as I paid the cashier and exited the store. As I marched merrily across the parking lot, an awful thought came into my mind. John, his name is John! Where did Bill come from? Was that one of my brothers? The sudden realization of what I did made me stop in my tracks. My head dropped when I realized my mistake. There was no way Mrs. Ricca would name one of her sons "Bill". "Billerica" was the name of a town just north of Boston.'], [11, 'Last year, on report card day,my son and a group of his 13-year-old friends piled into the back seat of my car,ready for the last-day-of-school party at McDonald\'s."Jack got a laptop for getting straight A\'s,and Laurie got a cell-phone,"one boy said."Oh,yeah,and Sarah got a MP3,and she\'s only in third grade,said another."And how about Brian? He got $ 10 for each A."    I suddenly became concerned.These payoffs might get parents through grammar school,but what about high school and beyond? What would be left after the electric guitar,the cell-phone,and the DVD player?    I saw the road ahead:As the homework load increased, my income would decrease.I saw my comfortable lifestyle disappear before my eyes---no more of those $5 bags of already-peeled organic carrots.No more organic anything!    I started to feel surprised and nervous.Would every goal achieved by my two children fetch a reward? A high grade point average? A good class ranking? Would sports achievements be included in this reward system:soccer goals,touchdowns? What about the orchestra? Would first chair pay more than second? I\'d be penniless by eighth-grade graduation.    "We never paid anything for good grades,"said my neightbour across the street,whose son was recently accepted at MIT."He just did it on his own.Maybe once in a while we went out for pizza,but that\'s about it."    Don\'t you just hate that? We\'re all running around looking for the MP3 player with the most updates, and she\'s spending a few dollars on pizza. She gets motivation;we get negotiation .And what about the primary grades? What do these students get? "When the teacher asked if anyone got rewards for good grades,everyone in my class raised their hand and said they got ice cream cones,"said one third grader.'], [15, 'Uncle Tom gave little Vicki Black a birthday gift one week before her birthday. He told her not to open it until her birthday. She knew her mother wouldn\'t tolerate any disrespect to the kind man who helped them out after Vicki\'s father passed away. Besides, Vicki didn\'t want to get Uncle Tom angry. But little Vicki didn\'t want to just hold it and guess what was in it. After all, she looked forward to his coming to show her interesting things, like how to turn an old sock into a doll.All the day, Vicki couldn\'t stop thinking about the gift. While her teacher was giving a lecture, Vicki sat still in her seat, drawing paper dolls inside the box. When school was done, she raced home. Walking into the room, again, she shook the present, but she heard nothing. Holding her breath, she opened the box and looked inside. Seconds later, she cried. When Mrs Black saw the box, she said angrily, "Didn\'t I tell you to leave it alone?"Vicki sobbed   and said, "Mommy, you don\'t understand.""Don\'t cry to me. You have missed everything now, just because you couldn\'t wait," Mrs Black accused. "What will Uncle Tom think now?""Uncle Tom gave me nothing," Vicki cried and handed the empty box to her mother. "He played a trick on me."Mrs Black said doubtfully, "Uncle Tom is not like that. You must have dropped it."Vicki kept crying. Only a rapid knock on the door made the house quiet. It was Uncle Tom. He looked at the empty box. "You have already done it? I told you to wait for your birthday.""You didn\'t give me a gift." Fresh tears filled her eyes."I try to give you something. I know your birthday is a special day. I tell myself to give you something valuable to last your whole life. I think hard and get an idea to give you an important lesson. If you open it on birthday, I see you learn. Then I will make a big party to celebrate, Maybe next year you listen, and then you will understand the gift better."Vicki\'s cheeks flushed  .'], [18, '"Is there anything else you need, honey?" my dad asked me as he put three twenty dollar bills in my hand. I was traveling back home from a family visit, and after treating me to breakfast and filling my car with gas, it was obvious that my dad wanted to make sure that I would be okay on the road."No, Dad. You\'ve done so much already. Thank you!" I was overwhelmed once again by his kind acts of providing everything I needed, although I turned 40. Yet I realize that in my father\'s eyes, I will always be his little girl. He takes deep pleasure in knowing his children are all right. Now that he has enough money, he loves to give whenever he sees a need.But this was not always the case. Divorced from my mother when I was 11, my dad couldn\'t be around his kids as often as he would have liked. Money was also tight; even weekend visits were rare. However, my dad stayed in constant communication with us and made sure he was involved in our lives. Though he couldn\'t always be there in person, I knew he was only a phone call away. I could always make sure of that.Even now, almost 30 years later, I treasure knowing that I can pick up the phone and call Dad, and he\'ll be there for me. I have a wonderful husband, but that hasn\'t changed how Dad sees me. I\'m still his child and he loves to see that my needs are met.I remember a time when I was shopping in a hardware store   with Dad. I mentioned my plans to paint one wall in my house. Well, that\'s all it took for Dad to take action. By the time I got to the checkout  line, all the supplies I picked out were put out of my hands and placed with things he bought.Then there was the time when I took him with me to do some grocery shopping for just a few " items". By the time we were finished, my shopping cart was full of groceries from every shelf in the store! My sister and I joke that if you don\'t want Dad to buy it for you, avoid even mentioning you want something.'], [22, "Today, roller skating is easy and fun. But a long time ago, it wasn't easy at all. Before 1750, the idea of skating didn't exist. That changed because of a man named Joseph Merlin. Merlin's work was making musical instruments. In his spare time he liked to play the violin. Joseph Merlin was a man of ideas and dreams. People called him a dreamer.One day Merlin received an invitation to attend a fancy dress ball. He was very pleased and a little excited. As the day of the party came near, Merlin began to think how to make a grand entrance at the party. He had an idea. He thought he would get a lot of attention if he could skate into the room.Merlin tried different ways to make himself roll. Finally, he decided to put two wheels under each shoe. These were the first roller skates. Merlin was very proud of his invention and dreamed of arriving at the party on wheels while playing the violin.On the night of the party Merlin rolled into the room playing his violin. Everyone was astonished to see him. There was just one problem. Merlin had no way to stop his roller skates. He rolled on and on. Suddenly, he ran into a huge mirror that was hanging on the wall. Down fell the mirror, breaking to pieces. Nobody forgot Merlin's grand entrance for a long time!"], [25, 'At 10:35 a.m. on December 17, 1903, two brothers from Ohio flew the first successful airplane for 12 seconds and 120 feet along a beach in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. With Orville flying first, the brothers took turns as pilot, and they flew three more times that day. On their fourth try, they managed to go 852 feet in 59 seconds ----an amazing feat at the time. The two brothers had invented powered flight. Orville and Wilbur Wright owned a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Although they had not gone to school to learn about airplanes or engineering, they were good mechanics. By repairing bicycles, they had learned how gears and pulleys worked. They also learned to take careful notes about what they saw. Each time they made a new design and tested a machine, they took notes and made drawings. They would study these to figure out what they could do better the next time.Before the Wright brothers flew, they did many things to prepare for this extraordinary achievement. They read everything they could find about air, balloons, and kites. Then they made careful sketches of what they wanted to build. They began by making model kites to learn how air flowed over wings. They made them bigger and bigger until they had a glider -- a kite that is big enough to hold a person, but with no engine. The Wright brothers made three gliders before building their first airplane. Each time they made a glider, they would test it, make careful observations, and then improve their design. When they made a glider that flew well, they added an engine. This step was harder than it sounds, because they had to find an engine that was both light-weight and powerful. The engines that they could buy were either too heavy or too weak, so they asked their friend Charlie Taylor to help them build one. The first engine that Charlie built broke almost immediately, but the second one worked well.   After Orville and Wilbur installed the engine in their plane, they were almost ready. They simply had to wait for the perfect day with just the fight amount of wind. On the morning of December 17, 1903, they had their chance. And the airplane flew into history.'], [28, "Geneva is situated between the Jura Range and the Alps on the western end of Lake Geneva. Capital of Peace is one of its names-- the European headquarters of the United Nations lies here in Palais des Nations. Another worthy name for this city with a humanitarian tradition and international character is the World's Smallest Metropolis. Parks,splendid stores and lively streets in the old part of town and its 2000 -- year history wait to be discovered.The Jet d'Eau together with the Flower Watch are the main attractions every year for the tourists visiting Geneva. The Jet d'Eau has become the symbol of Geneva for a long time. This is a 140 meters high water monument with a rich history. Eight 13,500--watt projectors light the grand column of the fountain in the evening, from early March until the second Sunday of October. The Flower Watch, which was created at the edge of the English Garden in 1955,reminds us about that Geneva is the birthplace of the Swiss clock and watch making, and that this industry has become internationally famous, as well through the quality of the watches as through their beautiful appearance.Sails on Lake Geneva are also enjoyable. The Lake of Geneva, lying among the Alps, is a true inland sea, making possible a wide range of pleasant boat trips, you can relax and watch the beautiful scenes pass by."], [30, "I walked down the hall heading to see my 88-year-old grandma who had been in hospital. Each member of the family was taking turns sitting with her because of her dementia  . As I did I looked very carefully at some of the rooms on this wing of the hospital, and it seemed that almost every bed held an elderly person. Some appeared to be confused, and some just looked lonely. I couldn't help but notice that there was no family there, no one to care them, and no one to reduce the ache of loneliness. My heart broke inside me.They are aging, with withered   skin on their faces and hands, their eyes look tried, and yet no one notices them. Could it be that we are far too busy to slow down and give a moment of our time to anyone that may swerve   us off the course we are traveling on? Are we afraid of those who have come before us to pave the way, afraid that they carry some awful disease that if we get too close we might catch it?Whatever the case may be, one day we will be those same people that we long to avoid. We pay thousands of dollars for staying young, and we may turn up the music to forget the thoughts of getting older. But, try as we might, time and age will catch up with us.We seem to have come to detest   the elderly. While we once held them in high regard and honor, always enjoying their stories of history, we now see them as a pain, always in our way. Isn't it time we wake up?So, next time you see a withered hand extended in need, or peer into the eyes of a lonely aging face, don't run or look away. Remember, it might just be you in that place one day."], [33, 'If you want to be a volunteer, you have to answer the following typical questions. Do you want to work with people, animals or machines? Do you want to work indoors or outdoors, directly serve people in need or serve people behind the scenes? Every year, thousands of people in the west offer volunteer service. Volunteering greatly strengthens the community because it helps the old, the young, the weak, the sick, and the disabled and the injured to solve problems.Volunteers usually help in many different ways. They may give people advice, offer friendship to the young, drive the elderly to church (if up to the driving age), advise kids against drugs, work as assistants in schools or nursing homes, raise funds, plant trees, help out in local libraries and do many other things. Volunteering can be a few hours a week or a few hours a month. Anybody who wants to serve people in need can become a volunteer.In fact, the art of volunteering is a process of both giving and receiving. Volunteering allows volunteers to meet new people, make new friends and mix with people from all walks of life. Volunteering is an excellent way to experiment and try out new techniques and skills, discover your individual talents and explore career choice. Being a volunteer will take you on a wonderful journey and help you learn more than what you can get from books.'], [36, 'Memory, they say, is a matter of practice and exercise. If you have the wish and really make a conscious   effort, then you can quite easily improve your ability to remember things. But even if you are successful, there are times when your memory seems to play tricks on you.Sometimes you remember things that really did not happen. One morning last week, for example, I got up and found that I had left the front door unlocked all night, yet I clearly remembered locking it carefully the night before.Memory "tricks" work the other way as well. Once in a while you remember not doing something and then find out that you did. One day last month, for example,I was sitting in a barbershop   waiting for my turn to get a haircut, and suddenly I realized that I had got a haircut two days before at the barbershop across the street from my office.We always seem to find something funny and interesting in incidents  caused by people\'s forgetfulness or absent-mindedness. Stories about absent-minded professors have been told for years. Unfortunately, however, absent-mindedness is not always funny. There are times when "tricks" of our memory can cause us great trouble.'], [39, "Let us take a serious look at what the results might be if such a suggestion were accepted. Families might use the time for a real family hour. They might sit around together after dinner and actually talk to one another. It is well known that many of our problems-everything, in fact, from the generation gap  to the high divorce rate to some forms of mental illnesses-are caused at least in part by the failure to communicate. We do not tell each other what is disturbing us. The result is emotional difficulty of one kind or another. By using the quiet family hour to discuss our problems, we might get to know each other better, and to like each other better.On evenings when such talk is unnecessary, families could rediscover more active entertainments. Freed from TV, forced to find their own activities, they might take a ride together to watch the sunset. Or they might take a walk together and see the neighborhood with fresh, new eyes.With free time and no TV, children and adults might rediscover reading. There is more entertainment in a good book than in a month of typical TV programming. Educators report that the generation growing up with television can hardly write an English sentence, even at the college level. Writing is often learned from reading. A more cultured new generation could be a product of the quiet hour.At first glance, the idea of an hour without TV seems radical  . What will parents do without the electronic baby-sitter? How will we spend the time? But it's not radical at all. It has been only twenty-five years since television came to control our free time. Those of us thirty-five and older can remember childhoods without television, spent partly with radio-which at least involved the listener's imagination-but also with reading, learning, talking, playing games and inventing new activities. It wasn't that difficult, honest. The truth is that we had a ball."], [43, 'I lost my sight when I was four years old by falling off a box car in a freight yard in Atlantic City and landing on my head. Now I am thirty two. I can slightly remember the brightness of sunshine and what color red is. It would be wonderful to see again, but a calamity  can do strange things to people. It occurred to me the other day that I might not have come to love life as I do if I hadn\'t been blind. I believe in life now. I am not so sure that I would have believed in it so deeply, otherwise. I don\'t mean that I would prefer to go without my eyes. I simply mean that the loss of them made me appreciate the more what I had left.Life, I believe, asks a continuous series of adjustments to reality. The more readily a person is able to make these adjustments, the more meaningful his own private world becomes. The adjustment is never easy. I was totally confused and afraid. But I was lucky. My parents and my teachers saw something in me--a potential to live, you might call it--which I didn\'t see, and they made me want to fight it out with blindness.The hardest lesson I had to learn was to believe in myself. That was basic. If I hadn\'t been able to do that, I would have collapsed   and _ for the rest of my life. When I say belief in myself I am not talking about simply the kind of self confidence that helps me down an unfamiliar staircase alone. That is part of it. But I mean something bigger than that: an assurance  that I am, despite imperfections, a real, positive person; that somewhere in the sweeping, intricate  pattern of people there is a special place where I can make myself fit.It took me years to discover and strengthen this assurance. It had to start with the simplest things. Once a man gave me an indoor baseball. I thought he was making fun of me and I was hurt. "I can\'t use this." I said. "Take it with you," he urged me, "and roll it around." The words stuck in my head. "Roll it around! "By rolling the ball I could hear where it went. This gave me an idea how to achieve a goal I had thought impossible: playing baseball. At Philadelphia\'s Overbrook School for the Blind I invented a successful variation of baseball. We called it ground ball.All my life I have set ahead of me a series of goals and then tried to reach them, one at a time. I had to learn my limitations. It was no good to try for something I knew at the start was wildly out of reach because that only invited the bitterness of failure. I would fail sometimes anyway but on the average I made progress.'], [47, 'Today we tell about the expression "down to earth".Down to earth means being open and honest.It is easy to deal with someone who is down to earth.Such people could be important members of society, but they do not consider themselves to be better than others who are less important.They do not let their importance "go to their heads." Someone who lets something go to his head feels he is better than others.He has a "big head."A person who is filled with his own importance and pride is said to have "his nose in the air."Often the person who has a big head and his nose in the air has no reason to feel better than others.Americans use another expression that is similar in some ways to down to earth---"both feet on the ground." Someone with both feet on the ground is a person with a good understanding of reality.She has what is called "common sense." She does not allow her dreams to block her understanding of what is real.The opposite kind of person is one who has his "head in the clouds." Someone with his head in the clouds is a person whose mind is not on what is happening in real life.Such a person may be called a "daydreamen."The person who is down to earth usually has both feet on the ground.But the opposite is not always true.Someone with both feet on the ground may not be as open and easy to deal with as someone who is down to earth.When we have both our feet firmly on the ground,and when we are down to earth,we do not have our noses in the air.We act honestly and openly to others.And our lives are like the ground below up--solid and strong.'], [50, 'What is one of the most boring and tiresome words ever? Like discipline, responsibility is one of those words you have probably heard so many times from authority figures that you have been a bit allergic to it. Still, it\'s one of the most important things to grow and to feel good about your life. Without it as a foundation nothing else in any personal development book really works.It\'s been said that the line between childhood and adulthood is crossed when we move from saying"It got lost"to"I lost it". Indeed, being accountable, understanding and accepting the role our choices play in the things that happen are important signs of emotional and moral maturity. That\'s why responsibility is one of the main supports of good character.Many people have been refusing to grow up and avoiding the burdens implied in being accountable. Yes, responsibility sometimes requires us to do things that are unpleasant or even frightening. It asks us to carry our own weight, prepare and set goals and exercise the discipline to reach our ambitions. But the benefits of accepting responsibility are far more important than the short-lived advantages of refusing to do so. No one makes his or her life better by avoiding responsibility. In fact, irresponsibility is a form of self-forced servitude   to circumstances and to other people.George Bernard Shaw once said,"People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don\'t believe in circumstances. The people whoget onin this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and, if they can\'t find them, make them.""Man must stop owing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his will -- his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals,"said Albert Schweitzer.The following incident shows blaming others and not taking full responsibility: Bernard L. Brown, Jr., once worked in a hospital where a patient knocked over a cup of water, which spilled on the floor beside the patient\'s bed. The patient was afraid he might slip on the water if he got out of the bed, so he asked a nurse to mop it up. The patient didn\'t know it, but the hospital policy said that small spills were the responsibility of the nurse while large spills were to be mopped up by the hospital\'s housekeeping group.The nurse decided the spill was a large one and she called the housekeeping group. A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one. An argument followed."It\'s not my responsibility,"said the nurse,"because it\'s a large puddle  ."The housekeeper didn\'t agree."Well, it\'s not mine,"she said,"the puddle is too small."The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor."Is that a big enough puddle now for you two to decide?"he asked. It was, and that was the end of the argument.So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. It is a concept of power that puts us in the driver\'s seat. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible. Responsible people not only depend on themselves, but show others that they can be depended on.'], [54, 'Ways to travelModern life is impossible without travelling. The fastest way to travel is by air. With a modern plane you can travel in one day to places which took a month or more one hundred years ago.Travelling by train is slower than by air, but it has its advantages . You can see the country you are travelling in. Modern trains have comfortable seats and dining cars. They make even the longest journey enjoyable.Some people prefer to travel by sea when it is possible. There are large lines and river boats with which you can visit many other countries and different places. Travelling by sea is a very pleasant way to spend a holiday.Many people like to travel by car. You can make your own timetable. You can travel three or four hundred miles or only fifty miles a day, just as you like. You can stop wherever you wish: where there is something interesting to see, at a good restaurant where you can enjoy a good meal, or a hotel to spend the night. That is why travelling by car is popular for pleasure trips, while people usually take a train or a plane when they are travelling on business.'], [57, "Children have their own rules in playing games. They seldom need a judge and rarely trouble to keep scores. They don't care much about who wins or loses, and it doesn't seem to worry them if the game is not finished. Yet, they like games that depend a lot on luck, so that their personal abilities cannot be directly compared. They also enjoy games that move in stages, in which each stage, the choosing of leaders, the picking-up of sides, or the determining of which side shall start, is almost a game in itself.Grown-ups can hardly find children's games exciting, and they often feel puzzled at why their kids play such simple games again and again. However, it is found that a child plays games for very important reasons. He can be a good player without having to think whether he is a popular person, and he can find himself being a useful partner to someone of whom he is ordinarily afraid. He becomes a leader when it comes to his turn. He can be confident, too, in particular games, that it is his place to give orders, to pretend to be dead, to throw a ball actually at someone, or to kiss someone he caught.It appears to us that when children play a game they imagine a situation under their control. Everyone knows the rules, and more important, everyone plays according to the rules. Those rules may be childish, but they make sure that every child has a chance to win."], [61, 'Carrying everything they need on their backs, three friends from England are setting out  to run 39 marathons across Eastern Europe.Tom, Rob and Guy ran the Marathon des Sables last year and were looking for another  challenge.Where do you go from there?" asks Tom.Then someone said, "Run 1,000 miles".And the idea was born.The three friends are running from Odessa in Ukraine to Dubrovnik in Croatia in 30 days,  to raise awareness of child trafficking  and to raise & 50,000 for the charity Love 146.

It\'s these traits that tend to affect some shy individuals\' ability to connect," says C. Barr Taylor, a professor of psychology at Stanford University."But while shyness can often be seen as a bad thing, there are ways to use the personality trait to your advantage," Taylor says. Below are some common shy habits and how you can learn to make them benefit you:Shy people usually reflect inwardly   a lot. But according to Taylor,all that thinking may not always be a bad thing and it should be viewed as a way you can think actively as you go into a situation. So, for shy people who feel worried about facing a particular challenge or event, Taylor advises slowly approaching the fearful situation if you start to feel anxious. By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. "Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted," he says. "If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it." What\'s more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.Shy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. "Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations," Taylor says. "It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room." In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren\'t shy. In addition, a shy person has a born drive to absorb a conversation, so they can be great at conversation.'], [68, 'Before l tell you bow many hours a day people spend ,watching content on tablets ,TVs,phones ,and so forth, let\'s talk quick about technology .The word ,l mean , according to my dictionary\'s primary definition, means  "the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes."These days, you say that word and  I\'d refer to most magic images of tablets ,smart phones, digital cameras ,satellites, cruise missiles ,electric cars or glasses-free 3D handhelds.

The thunder of their hooves   rings in the riders' ears, nearly drowning out the cheering of the crowd. After three or four minutes of suspense, one horse crosses the finish line first, winning the Melbourne Cup and earning a place in history.The horses that compete in the Melbourne Cup--one of the world's most famous horseraces--were fated to race. Bred for speed, these horses are the few that were singled out as having potential to become champions.Preparing a racehorse to compete requires a team. A horse's owner manages the team and decides which races to enter. A trainer determines the racehorse's diet and exercise. Regular exercise makes a horse less likely to be injured, but overtraining tires the horse. A groomer   cares for the racehorse and reports any problems he discovers to the trainer. And of course, no horserace could be run without a rider. These riders train for long hours and travel constantly from one race to another. They need to make a strategy, adapt to changing conditions and communicate with their horse to guide it to victory.Australia's most famous horserace, the Melbourne Cup, is 3,200 meters of pure excitement. Each year 300 or 400 horses are nominated  , but only 24 can run. The competitors are chosen based on a number of factors, but winners of certain races qualify automatically.Each racehorse receives a handicap--a certain weight it must carry to give each horse an equal chance of winning--two months before the race. Originally, horses that seemed likely to win were assigned larger handicaps. But the rules have changed, reducing the handicap for previous winners.The first Melbourne Cup in 1861 drew a crowd of 4,000 spectators, and the race's popularity has grown since then. Held on the first Tuesday of November, the cup has become a four-day festival with fine food and entertainment.The Melbourne Cup began during a gold rush as a form of entertainment for the rich.

Social robots are about to bring technology to the everyday world in a more humanized way, said Cynthia Breazeal, chief scientist at the robot company Jibo.While household robots today do the normal housework, social robots will be much more like companions than mere tools. For example, these robots will be able to distinguish when someone is happy or sad. This allows them to respond more appropriately to the user.The Jibo robot, arranged to ship later this year, is designed to be a personalized assistant. You can talk to the robot, ask it questions, and make requests for it to perform different tasks. The robot doesn\'t just deliver general answers to questions; it responds based on what it learns about each individual in the household. It can do things such as reminding an elderly family member to take medicine or taking family photos.Social robots are not just finding their way into the home. They have potential applications in everything from education to health care and are already finding their way into some of these spaces.Fellow Robots is one company bringing social robots to the market. The company\'s "Oshbot" robot is built to assist customers in a store, which can help the customers find items and help guide them to the product\'s location in the store. It can also speak different languages and make recommendations for different items based on what the customer is shopping for.The more interaction the robot has with humans, the more it learns. But Oshbot, like other social robots, is not intended to replace workers, but to work alongside other employees.

This digital society that we live in affords us opportunities that our ancestor only dreamed of having. _ In the not so distant past of the 1950s, people who wanted to research an idea, a product, or anything else, had to go to a library where they could look up information in books. Not all people had the same access to the books, and the information they contained. In America, if your skin was black, you could not use the same library that a person with white skin used. If a black skinned person was allowed access to a library, it most likely was stocked with outdated books that white skinned people had discarded.In the digital society we live in today, the color of your skin does not determine the access you have to information. Technology has brought to us the powerful tools like the Internet where we can find information on almost every subject.Access to the Internet has allowed us to research the things we are planning to purchase. We are capable of comparing prices on things like insurance, appliances, entertainment, clothing, and all other things. We also now have the ability to purchase items online without ever leaving our homes. We have been freed from the restrictions of store hours, and regional sales. A person in America can purchase a product from a person in Germany, without leaving home.Because of the digital society we live in our children can learn about anything they are interested in.

We finished the 12th at the Games. I soon quit double skating and tried to continue in singles. But I wasn\'t good enough; I didn\'t even compete in the next two national championships. I felt like I was a somebody who had become a nobody.    I was 18 and had just graduated from high school, when my mum told me, "You can\'t just depend on skating to make a living. You\'d better find a job." I knew she was right. So I found a job at a restaurant where I waited at tables and did anything else that needed to be done. In fact, I worked so hard that I had never got the chance to have a break. No one cared that I had been an Olympic skater; I was judged only by how hard I worked.    That job taught me so many things. I learned, for example, how to deal with people. As an athlete, this was new to me. One day a man loudly called me over to his table and complained, "This milk is sour. I am not drinking this junk! I want my money back!

A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the "now". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be "just like Bali". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.One factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly linked that all members usually live in the same block.Balinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called "Hindu Darma". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this. The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.In spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to _ their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have inclinations   either to music, dance, painting, or decoration.Another remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the senses of ceremonies known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life.

Seriously, you should pay more attention to those roses. They could greatly improve your life.

GOPO(R) has also been shown to improve mood, increase energy and sleep quality of those affected by arthritis. Marked by stiffness, swelling, loss of flexibly and pain, arthritis can significantly stop one from a normal life."We have little doubt that certain rose hip preparations, and GOPO(R) in particular, have had an important role to play in reducing the pain and disability caused by arthritis," said Winther.With the aid of this new research, those affected by joint pain caused by arthritis could choose an alternative treatment than pain killers.

On most ships, tip the maitre d'  or dining room captain only if you ask for special favors or table-side service; $5 to $10 is normal. Barmen and wine stewards are tipped 10 to 15 percent, but many cruise lines will add this tip to your bar or drink bill. Check the bill to see how it is handled. Also, tips for special services such as salon && spa treatments and room service are left to the guest, depending on services offered. Sometimes tips are placed in envelopes from your cabin's stationery supply. Generally, passengers on cruises of 10 days or less will tip at the end of the cruise; on longer voyages, tipping weekly.

Norwegian, for example, charges $10 per day, per guest, to cover service in the various dining rooms and your room steward.

It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common; or rather, any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet the needs of that particular group.Research suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by different individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of tasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to "get things done". Expressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective well-beings  of a social group\'s members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the overall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and attempting to minimize tension and conflict among them.Instrumental leaders are likely to have a rather secondary relationship to other group members. They give others and may discipline group members who inhibit  attainment of the group\'s goals. Expressive leaders develop a more personal or primary relationship to others in the group. They offer sympathy when someone experiences difficulties and try to solve problems that threaten to divide the group. As the difference between these two roles suggests, expressive leaders generally receive more personal affection from group members; instrumental leaders, if they are successful in promoting group goals, may enjoy a more distant respect.'], [118, 'I believe that animals possess greater intelligence than most people think. But plants? I\'ve never considered the possibility of plant intelligence.  The idea seems absurd .Yet I\'ve had friends argue that plant intelligence might exist. "What are the differences between plants and animals?" they ask, and then they argue about certain species that seem to share the intelligence of both plants and animals. New research suggests that plants communicate via "networks". Plant communication is not idea, and cannot indicate that it is a kind of intelligence, but it is still interesting.Recent research from Vidi researcher Josef Stuefer at the Radboud University Nijmegen shows that plants have their own chat systems that they can use to warn each other. Therefore plants are not boring and passive organisms that just stand there waiting to be cut down or eaten up. Many plants form internal communication networks and are able to exchange information networks and are able to exchange information efficiently.Many herbal plants such as strawberries and clovers  naturally form networks. Individual plants remain connected with each other for a certain period of time by means of runners (plant stems that grow along the ground and put down roots to form new plants). These connections enable the plants to share information with each other via internal channels. They are therefore very similar to computer networks. But what do plants chat to each other about?Recently Stuefer and hus colleagues were the first to prove that clover plants warn each other via the network links if danger is nearby. If one of the plants is attacked by caterpillars  , the other members of the network are warned via an internal signal. Once warned the intact  plants strengthen their chemical and mechanicaicl resistance so that they are less attractive to advancing  caterpillars. Thanks to this early warning system, the plants can stay one step ahead of their attackers. The research has shown that this significantly limits the damage to the plants.Again, I don\'t believe this reflects intelligence,'], [122, 'Normally a student must attend a certain number of courses in order to graduate, and each course which he attends gives him a credit which he may count towards a degree. In many American universities the total work for a degree consists of thirty-six courses, each lasting for one semester. A typical course consists of three classes per week for fifteen weeks; while attending a university a student will probably attend four or five courses during each semester. Normally a student would expect to take four years attending two semesters each year. It is possible to spread the period of work for the degree over a longer period. It is also possible for a student to move between one university and another during his degree course, though this is not in fact done as a regular practice.For every course that he follows a student is given a grade, which is recorded, and the record is available for the student to show to future employers. All this imposes a constant pressure and stress of work, but in spite of this some students still find time for great activity in student affairs.

I practiced half an hour every day, went to lessons once a week, and occasionally played in a group concert. Like most kids, I always thought practicing was boring. If my parents hadn't been there to make me practice, I probably would have put down my violin and never have picked it up again.I met Moira when I was 11 at an Irish music party. Moira hosted the party that night, playing the violin, singing and dancing. She made sure that everyone in the room got involved and had a great time. I immediately fell in love with the music she played and the energy that she brought to it. Just a few days after that party, I took my first lesson with Moira, and I continued taking lessons with Moira throughout middle school.When I started playing the violin with Moira, playing music became something that I loved. She introduced me to so many types of music, from Irish to Old Time, to Cajun. Moira also taught me to play the guitar. Soon we started performing together and were shocked to discover that people actually wanted to hear us! When I began to play the violin, practicing was something that I did at home in my living room, but with Moira's influence it quickly became something that I did everywhere. I played on street corners, at festivals, at the beach, at parties, at weddings, and late at night in my friends' kitchens.Moira took the music out to the classroom and brought it to life. Her passion was not only for playing music, but also for sharing it. My time with Moira allowed me to grow both musically and personally. I have met so many special people and had so many invaluable  experiences. Moira has proven to be the most important influence in my musical development, and also my invaluable friend."], [129, 'My room faces the sun in the morning and on clear summer mornings it wakes me bright and fresh, no matter what time I stayed up till; I\'ll get up and make breakfast. This morning I wake up suddenly, like the alarm clock in my head has given me a little electric shock; it isn\'t sunny outside. I pull back the curtains and the sky is dark grey. Hearing my brother is getting up, I go downstairs to make him a cup of tea. He\'s down in the kitchen about five minutes later, wearing his work clothes, eyes mostly closed against the morning. "Morning." I say. "Uh huh." I leave him to work out what he is going to eat and go back to my room, and get back beneath the quilt . This morning I want to think a while. Today is Dad\'s birthday; Mom won\'t mention it. My brother might, just to _ , so I\'ll keep him sweet when he comes in from work. Every year on my dad\'s birthday I draw a picture of him; each year he looks a bit different. I\'m an artist. It\'s not that I draw a straighter line or a truer circle, as they try to teach us to do at school. I just get the message across more clearly than other people. More truthfully. I know it.I read a lot of books too, mainly about artists, and I try to paint like them. When my dad comes back I\'ll be able to say "this is you when I was twelve and I was in love with Monet" or "this is you on your thirty-eighth birthday, when I was fourteen, and you\'d been gone five years, and I wanted to paint like Dante Gabriel Rossetti." And he\'ll look at each painting and know that I love him and never forget him. On Saturday mornings he\'d take me to town and I\'d drag him around the art shops. On my sixth birthday he bought me a box of 99 crayons. On my eighth birthday he bought me an easel  , a real one, not a kiddie\'s. On my ninth birthday he bought me oils. Some mornings I\'d wake up and there\'d be a book on my pillow about Picasso, or Chagall."Draw me," he\'d say. "Aw, Dad, I can\'t."I know I should go to school; I\'m not one of those kids who are scared to go. But, it\'s my dad\'s birthday and I think I must spend it with him. So I spend some time thinking about his hair, which I think is probably no more grey than it was last year; I know hair doesn\'t age at the same speed every year, but I make his hair longer this year. And in my mind\'s eye I give him an extra few pounds too. But I keep the smile fixed in my head, like it is when he\'s happy. It\'s head and shoulders, so I\'ll put him in a T-shirt that shows his neck and throat and how strong he is and how brightly his eyes shine and how his eyebrows are dead level straight and still black. I try to think of how much I want to show and how much I want to tell. Then I pick up a charcoal stick  and do it. I pick up a chalk to add a suggestion of color1 to his eyes, then another chalk for his mouth. And there he is. Dad.

Researchers from the University of Plymouth in England doubted whether mood might affect the way kids learn. To find out the answer, they did two experiments with children.The first experiment tested 30 kids. Someshapes  were hidden inside a different, larger picture. The kids had to find the small shapes while sitting in a room with either cheerful or sad music playing in the background. To test their mood, the scientists asked the kids to point to one of five faces, from happy to sad. Children who listened to cheerful music tended to point to the smiley faces while the others pointed to the unhappy ones. The researchers found that sad kids took at least a second less to find the small shapes. They also found an average of three or four more shapes.In the second experiment, 61 children watched one of two scenes from a film. One scene was happy, and the other was sad. Just like in the first experiment, kids who saw the sad scene acted better compared to the others.The researchers guessed that feeling down makes people more likely to focus on a problem or difficult situation. Not all scientists agree with them, however. Other studies argued that maybe, that cheerful music in the first experimentdistracted   kids from finding shapes.While scientists work on finding out the answers, it still might be wise to choose when to do your tasks according to your mood.

The battle between form and function rose again when James Dyson, British inventor of the Dvson vacuum cleaner that has sold in millions around the world, resigned as chairman of London's Design Museum. It is widely believed that Mr. Dyson felt that the museum put too much stress on style at the expense of serious industrial design.Mr. Dyson accused the museum of not keeping true to itself. He may be right, but these days, museums everywhere can no longer afford to be unique centers of scholarship and learning. Among competition for sponsorship, they must use exhibitions of populist culture, nice cafes and shops or, best of all, a new building by Frank Gehry to increase visitor numbers.On the one hand, some producers can be too old-fashioned and too concerned with the importance of product engineering and the functionality of their goods. On the other hand, there are those who believe that how a product looks is more important. Design is indeed a broad term, involving both function and form. Typically, in any given product area, it changes from the former to the latter.  Clothing is a good example. But surely you would have to be a very shallow person to think something's appearance is more important than what it does.Today nearly all goods at any given price point do much the same job. So almost the  only way producers can differentiate their products from those of their competitors is to create some sort of emotional connection with the consumer, which could be through the visual appeal of the product or its packaging, or the imagery  created by advertising. And what of the Dyson vacuum cleaner? Mr. Dyson may believe that people buy these machines because of the graphs showing their superior suction, but most vacuum cleaners do a good job; the main reason people pay extra for a Dyson is that it is a vacuum cleaner with a fashionable  brand. With its inside workings exposed, it is a bit like a Richard Rogers building with all its pipes shown in bright colors on the outside instead of being hidden inside. Functional it may be, but it is a bit of a trick, too."], [139, 'There are three different kinds of friends in our life. I classify   them according to how well I know them and how well they know me.The first type of friend is just an acquaintance  .This means that you only know their name. You might not even remember what they look like if you go away for a short vacation. You don\'t miss them when they are elsewhere. It is also this type of friend who gives you the most amount of aggravation  .Since most of the time you are placed in a position where you have to act friendly. You would not normally tell an acquaintance when he or she is doing something that makes you feel angry,such as tapping the fingers on a table or shouting loudly. I call them "pest friends".The second kind of friend is a "guest friend".They are just social partners. You meet them at a certain location and at the end of the meeting you go your separate way and they go theirs. You don\'t talk too often with this sort of friend,and you don\'t share each other\'s secrets.Lastly,we have  "best friends".This sort of friend is there when you need them. They know you as a person and they are there through thick and thin. Best friends are the ones that you can lean and depend on no matter what happens.

Five years ago, researchers found an area in the Atlantic Ocean seabed, where a part of the Earth\'s outer layer, or crust , is  missing. A thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed.The crust, mantle  and core  are the main layers that make up the planet. The mantle rests between the crust and the core.Last month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.The hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. "It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth," says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.The site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth\'s surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.The hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what\'s below the Earth\'s   surface. The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle.

They had farms, temples and cities with many buildings. They knew much about nature and the world around them. This knowledge helped them to live a better life than most people of that time.In ancient Mexico there were many small clearings in the forest. In each clearing was a village with fields of crops around it. The Maya planted seeds after they cleared the land. A farmer was able to grow crops that produced for several people. But not every Maya had to be a farmer. Some were builders or priests  .The Maya believed in many gods. They built large temples to honor them. Skillful workers built cities around these temples. It was difficult because they had to carry all of the building materials themselves. Today, many of these ancient Mayan cities and temples are still standing.Although the Maya worked hard to build the beautiful cities, very few of them lived in them. Usually, only the priests lived in the cities. The other people lived in small villages in the forests. Their houses were much simpler. Most Maya lived a simple life close to nature.Measuring time correctly was important to the Maya, so Mayan priests made a system to keep track of time. They wrote numbers as dots ( ... ) and bars ( -- ). They also made a calendar  . The year was divided into 18 months of 20 days each with five days left over.Around the year 800, the Maya left their villages and beautiful cities, never to return. No one knows why this happened.

And then there are the neurotic or unhealthy perfectionists who never feel satisfied but keep struggling towards impossible goals.These people often measure their own self-worth entirely in terms of productivity and accomplishment.It is necessary to notice if you are struggling and feel tense while trying to perfect your recipe, article, parenting, job, project, etc.You are fighting and resisting your own humanness.How do you know if you suffer from perfectionism?* Are you afraid of making mistakes?* Do you get impatient with others when they make a mistake?* If you fail an assignment at work or school, do you feel like a failure?* How do you feel when you read these questions?Your relationship with yourself is the foundation for all of your other relationships.If you are hard on yourself, then you\'ll in turn be hard on others.If we are unable to care for our innermost beings, then our lives will reflect this fault in some way.Embracing  your own humanness is the doorway to seeing the miracles of who you are at your best.Dr. Bemie Siegcl writes in his new book on miracles, "Our body loves us, but it needs to know we love our lives in order for it to do all it can to help us survive.The change in body energy motivated by the love leads to chemical changes in our body and makes a difference.In many cases, this kind of miracle needs hard work.But when you are willing to do the work, and live in your heart, it can happen."'], [168, 'You must have been troubled by when to say "I love you" because it is one of the greatest puzzles in our life.What if you say it first and your partner doesn\'t love you back?

But is the person who says it first really in a position of weakness? Doesn\'t it pay to hold back, play it cool and wait until the other half has shown their hand faster?"A really good relationship should be about being fair and being equal," says psychologist Sidney Crown. "But love is seldom equal." "All relationships go through power struggles but," he says, "if a love imbalance continues for years, the rot will set in." That feeling of "I\'ve always loved you more" may be subverted (,) for a time, but it never goes away completely and it often emerges in squabbling  . In love, at least, the silent, withholding type is not always the most powerful. "The strongest one in a relationship is often the person who feels confident enough to talk about their feelings," says educational psychologist Ingrid Collins. Psychosexual therapist Paula Hall agrees. "The one with the upper hand is often the person who takes the initiative." In fact, the person who says "I love you" first may also be the one who says  "I\'m bored with you\' first." Hall believes that much depends on how "I love you" is said and the motivation of the person saying it. Is it said when they\'re drunk? Is it said before their partner flies off on holiday, and what it really means is "Please don\' t be unfaithful to me" ? By saying "I love you", they are really saying "Do you love me?" If so, wouldn\'t it just be more honest to say that. Collins agrees that intention is everything. "It\'s not what is said, but how it\'s said. What it comes down to is the sincerity of the speaker."'], [172, 'A few months ago as I wandered through my parents\' house, the same house I grew up in, I had a sudden, scary realization. When my parents bought the house, in 1982, they were only two years older than I am now. I tried to imagine myself in two years, ready to settle down and buy the house I\'d still be living in almost 30 years later.    It seemed ridiculous. On a practical level, there\'s no way I could afford to buy a house anytime soon. More importantly, I wouldn\'t want to. I\'m not sure where I\'ll be living in two years, or what kind of job I\'ll have. And I don\'t think I\'ll be ready to settle down and stay in one place.    So this is probably the generation gap that divides my friends and me from our parents. When our parents were our age, they\'d gotten their education, chosen a career, and were starting to settle into responsible adult lives.    My friends and I - "Generation Y" - still aren\'t sure what we want to do with our lives. Whatever we end up doing, we want to make sure we\'re happy doing it. We\'d rather take risks first, try out different jobs, and move from one city to another until we find our favorite place. We\'d rather spend our money on travel than put it in a savings account.    This casual attitude toward responsibility has caused some critics to call my generation "arrogant", "impatient", and "overprotected". Some of these complaints have a point. As children ,we were encouraged to succeed in school, but also to have fun. We grew up in a world full of technological innovation: cellphones, the Internet, instant messaging, and video games.    Our parents looked to rise vertically --starting at the bottom of the ladder and slowly making their way to the top, on the same track, often for the same company. That doesn\'t apply to my generation.    Because of that, it may take us longer than our parents to arrive at responsible, stable adulthood. But that\'s not necessarily a bad thing. In our desire to find satisfaction, we will work harder, strive for ways to keep life interesting, and gain a broader set of experiences and knowledge than our parents\' generation did.

It was seen as a way to _ men and women in prison by helping them go straight when they got out.Those taxpayer-supported college classes were put to an end in the 1990s. But New York Governor Andrew Cuomo would like to bring them back in the state, setting off a fierce new debate.A number of lawmakers in New York have promised to kill Cuomo\'s proposal  .Cuomo says reintroducing taxpayer-funded college classes in New York\'s prisons is a common-sense plan that will reduce the number of inmates who commit new crimes."You pay $ 60,000 for a prison cell for a year," Cuomo responded. "You put a guy away for 10 years, and that\'s $600,000. Right now, chances are almost half. Once he\'s set free, he\'s going to come right back."Cuomo says helping inmates get a college education would cost about $ 5,000 a year per person. He argues, "It\'s a small amount of money if it keeps that inmate from bouncing back into prison."But even some members of the governor\'s own party hate this idea. State Assemblywoman Addie Russell, whose upstate district includes three state prisons, says taxpayers just won\'t stand for inmates getting a free college education, while middle-class families struggle to pay for their kids\' college fees."That is the vast majority of feedback   that I\'m also getting from my constituents  ," she says. "You know, \'Where is the relief for the rest of the population who obey the law ?\' ""I was very disappointed that the policy had been changed," says Gerald Gaes, who served as an expert on college programs for the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the 1990s. In 1994, President Clinton stopped federal student aid programs for inmates.Gaes says research shows that college classes actually save taxpayers\' money over time, by reducing the number of inmates who break the law and wind up back in those expensive prison cells."It is cost-effective," he says. "Designing prisons that way will have a long-term benefit for New York State."'], [199, 'Nature responds to climate change. To understand it, we need to monitor key life cycle events-flowering, the appearance of leaves the first frog calls of the spring-all around the world. But scientists can\'t be everywhere so they\'re turning to non-scientists, sometimes called citizen scientists, for help.A group of scientists and educators launched   an organization last year called the National Phenology Network. "Phenology" is what scientists call the study of the timing of events in nature.One of the group\'s first efforts depends on scientists and non-scientists alike to collect data about plant flowering and leafing every year. The program, called Project BudBurst, collects life cycle data on different kinds of common plants from across the prefix = st1 /United States."People don \'t have to be plant experts-they just have to look around and see what\'s in their neighbourhood,"says Jennifer Schwartz, an adviser with the project, "As we collect this data, we\'ll be able to predict how plants and communities of plants and animals will respond as the climate changes." That data will help scientists predict not only how natural communities may change but also how these changes will affect people.Scientists monitoring lilac   flowering in the western United States reported that in years when lilacs bloomed early - before May 20th-wildfires later in the summer and fall are larger and more severe.  _ , Jennifer says.Improved monitoring is an important step toward predicting how natural communities will respond to climate change."The best way for us to increase our knowledge of how plants and animals are responding to climate change is to increase the amount of data we have," he says.

As soon as I saw that there were no presents, I grabbed my plastic sword and ran at him, shouting angrily: "THIEF! THIEF!"JackWhen I was young, we always had a specific room for the Christmas tree. My mom never really liked the location, so one year she moved the tree into another room. I was convinced that Santa would not know where the tree was and would get lost in our house. I was worried that he would be mad and put me on the "bad" list and would not give me any gifts because he couldn\'t find the tree. I came up with the idea to make signs leading from the fireplace to the tree. They said things like: "Tree this way" or "Santa, put the gifts over here." When my big brother saw them he began to laugh his head off.LucyDoes everyone remember going to the mall and sitting on Santa\'s lap to have his picture taken at Christmas time?Well, I used to think that if I did that, Santa would get mad bcause he would have to go all around the world and give every kid the chance to have his picture taken with him. Of course his lap would hurt and he would be very fired.

Let us examine some of the expressions that use "hand".We will get a hand in this way. "To get a hand in" is to begin a job, to begin to know something about it. When we learn completely, we will be able to do it hands down. If we do the job well, we may end up with the upper hand. On the other hand, if the situation gets out of hand, it is out of control.We must consider another way of expressing phrase---- to hand it to someone. For example, I must hand it to you for understanding what we have discussed this far. You can also lend a hand to someone but without really giving up your hand. You lend a hand when you help someone. If someone is kind enough to lend us a hand then we surely do not want to bite the hand that feeds us. We do not want to repay his kindness by treating him badly.Now, we have a free hand to continue examining other "hand" expressions. It means you are free to act without getting permission from someone else.Maybe you can find a friend who wants to take a hand in our project. It would have to be someone who was interested in these expressions. Your friend may want to work hand in glove with us. That is good because that means he wants to work as closely with us as a glove covers the hand. Of course, there is a danger that he may look at our project and decide to take it in hand. That means he wants to tale it over. If that happens, we may throw up our hands because the situation seams hopeless. In fact, we may decide that it is time for us to end this project to wash our hands of " hand" expressions.'], [219, 'The question of what children learn, and how they should learn, is continually being debated and redebated. Nobody dares any longer to defend the old system, the learning of lessons parrot-fashion, the grammar-with-a-whip system, which was good enough for our grandparents. The theories of modem psychology have stepped in to argue that we must understand the need of children. Children are not just small adults; they are children who must be respected as much.Well, you may say, this is as it should be, a good idea. But think further. What happens? "Education" becomes the responsibility not of teachers, but of psychologists  . What happens then? Teachers worry too much about the psychological implications   of their lessons, and forget about the subjects themselves. If a child dislikes a lesson, the teacher feels that it is his fault, not the child\'s. So teachers worry whether history is "relevant" to modern young children. And do they dare to recount stories about violence? Or will this make the children themselves violent? Can they tell their classes about children of different races, or will this encourage racial hatred? Why teach children to write grammatical sentences? Verbal expression is better. Sums? Arithmetic? No: Real-life mathematical situations are more understandable.You see, you can go too far. Influenced by educational theorists, who have nothing better to do than to write books about their ideas, teachers leave their teacher-training colleges filled with grand, psychological ideas about children and their needs. They make elaborate, sophisticated (,) preparations and try out their "modem methods" on the long-suffering children. Since one "modem method" rapidly replaces another the poor kids will have had a good bellyful by the time they leave school. Frequently the modem methods are so sophisticated that they fail to be understood by the teachers, let alone the children; even more often, the relaxed discipline so essential for the " informal" feelings the class must have, prevents all but a handful of children from learning anything.'], [224, 'Medalists of the 1948 London Olympic Games look back on their summer of victory.SAMMY Lee, 91, U.S.GOLD AND BRONZE, DIVINGI first had my Olympic dream at 12, when they held the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. My father and I were at a grocery store, and I asked, "What are all the flags doing here?" He said, "We are having the Olympic Games. That\'s where they honor the greatest athletes in the world." I said, "Papa, someday I\'m going to be an Olympic champ."Walking up the 10-meter platform, I thought to myself, "I\'ve waited 16 years for this moment. Am I going to win?" So I prayed to God that I was most deserving of winning the Games.DAVID BOND, 90, BRITAINGOLD, SAILINGDuring the war, I spent six years in Royal Air Force. I think in general, the 1948 Olympics meant very little to most people. We were too busy after the war to be worried about sport very much anyway.Our team had about six weeks before the Olympics down at Torquay and we went out sailing every day.Winning gold was quite something. It was nice to stand on the platform with lots of people cheering. We celebrated by going to a big dance.MICHAEL LAPAGE, 88, BRITAINSILVER, ROWINGI started rowing when I was 14. I joined the navy in 1942. In 1945 the war came to an end and I started rowing again.In 1948 we were still on rations  : 4 oz. of red meat a week. But the United States had all the meat they wanted. They were the favorites to win.On the day of the final, we led the Americans at the start, but their stronger staying power took them through to win. There were no ribbons on the medals, so we just showed them round the family.THOMAS GODWIN, 91, BRITAINBRONZE, CYCLINGAt 14 I left school and got a job delivering groceries on a bicycle, which excited my interest in cycling.

What was going through your mind as you were going through that negativity? Was your mind cluttered with   different kinds of thoughts? Or was it paralyzed, unable to think?The next time you find yourself in the middle of a very stressful time, or you feel angry or frustrated, stop. Yes, that\'s right, stop. Whatever you\'re doing, stop and sit for one minute. While you\'re sitting there, completely _ yourself in the negative emotion.Allow that emotion to consume you. Allow yourself one minute to truly feel that emotion. Don\'t cheat yourself here. Take the entire minute--but only one minute--to do nothing else but feel that emotion.When the minute is over, ask yourself, "Am I willing to keep holding on to this negative emotion as I go through the rest of the day?"Once you\'ve allowed yourself to be totally immersed in the emotion and really feel it, you will be surprised to find that the emotion clears rather quickly.If you feel you need to hold on to the emotion for a little longer, that is OK. Allow yourself another minute to feel the emotion.When you feel you\'ve had enough of the emotion, ask yourself if you\'re willing to carry that negativity with you for the rest of the day. If not, take a deep breath. As you exhale, release all that negativity with your breath.This exercise seems simple--almost too simple. But, it is very effective. By allowing that negative emotion the space to be truly felt, you are dealing with the emotion rather than stuffing it down and trying not to feel it. You are actually taking away the power of the emotion by giving it the space and attention it needs. When you immerse yourself in the emotion, and realize that it is only emotion, it loses its control. You can clear your head and proceed with your task.'], [231, 'I arrived in the classroom,ready to share my knowledge and experience with 76 students who would be my English literature class.

I went back to my office with the rosy glow which came from a strong sense of achievement.    My students kept diaries. However, as I read them the rosy glow was gradually replaced by a strong sense of sadness.The first diary said, "Our literature teacher didn\'t teach us anything today perhaps her next lecture will be better." Greatly surprised.I read diary after diary, each expressing a similar theme. "Didn\'t I teach them anything? I described the entire Western  _ and laid the historical background for all the works we will study in class," I complained. "How should they say I didn\'t teach them anything?"    It was a long term, and it gradually became clear that my ideas about education were not the same as those of my students. I thought a teacher\'s job was to raise interesting questions and provide enough background so that students could draw their own conclusions.

Your mood may affect how you see the world around you, according to a new study. A team of researchers has proved that sadness could have an effect on the way we see colors.The team, led by psychology researcher Christopher Thorstenson of the University of Rochester, found that people who had a sad mood were less accurate in identifying colors on the blue-yellow axis  , compared to people who weren\'t feeling sad."We were already deeply familiar with how often people use color terms to describe common phenomena, like mood, even when these concepts seem unrelated," Thorstenson said in a statement. "We thought maybe a reason why these metaphors   appear was that there really was a connection between mood and identifying colors in a different way."Thorstenson and his team are not the first to identify a link between a depressed mood and a difference in recognition. In 2010, Emanuel Bubl and his team at Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg in Germany first proved a link between mood and identifying colors. This was supported by a 2013 paper by Johnson Fam of the University of Singapore.The team conducted two studies. In the first, 127 participants were chosen _ to watch one of two video clips, which had been proved in previous studies to feel either sadness or amusement. They didn\'t do that in a specific order. The entire group was then tasked with identifying the colors in 48 continued color changes. The group that had been shown the sad clip was measurably worse at identifying colors along the blue-yellow axis.For the second study, 130 participants were randomly assigned to watch either a sad clip or a neutral   one.

According to the American Pet Products Association, 62 percent households in the U.S. own a pet. It\'s estimated that owners will spend about $55.5 billion on goods and services for their pets this year, up about $2 billion from last year.That\'s a small price to pay for the unconditional love and loyalty you get from a pet.

What she saw there made her stop dead in her tracks.Being a busy college student just one year removed from her teenage years, she wasn\'t exactly obsessive-compulsive  about the neatness of her clothes. But her boss at the restaurant where she works saw things a little differently. He had recently lectured the entire staff on the importance of appearance, and had specifically mentioned the need for servers to wear clean, unwrinkled blouses. As an assistant manager, Janelle felt it was important to set an example for the other employees. But if she stopped to iron the blouse normally, she would be late --and work without delay was an area of even greater concern to her boss.So she grabbed her iron and plugged it in and set it for low heat. Carefully holding her blouse away from her body, she continued to iron it while she was wearing it. It seemed like a logical answer to an urgent problem.And it seemed to be working until Janelle tried to iron the collar and accidentally ironed her neck by mistake. Then it suddenly seemed like a really stupid idea and a really painful one as well. It took more time to treat her burn than it would have taken to iron her shirt properly. And she spent a miserable shift dealing with the pain of the burn.We\'ve all been there, haven\'t we? For me it was cutting my own hair.

But if the lives of all the children had followed this pattern, the program would be far less interesting than it actually was. It was the children whose childhood did not prepare them for what was to come that made the program so inspiring. Where did their ideas come from about what they wanted to do when they grew up?

Choose how you want to think and act.Other people can\'t make you unhappy or angry.They only act in their own way and then it\'s up to you to decide how you will respond .For example,your friends go out to lunch without you and you feel very angry.How are you going to act? You may blame your friends,"They are not kind.Who needs them anyway?" Or you may tell your friends how you feel,listen to their explanation,and let them know you\'d like to be invited next time.When you decide everything in your own way,you\'re getting hold of your own life and shaping it according to your tastes and feelings.You can choose to be happy,to make friends and to build an interesting life.When you blame others for what is or isn\'t happening in your life,you have stopped growing or learning.One of the most important rules is that you can never change another person by your direct action.The only person you have the right to change is yourself.Once you change,the other person has something different to respond to and change is possible.If you want change in your life,begin with yourself.'], [268, "Basic Study Manual    Hardcover: $ 37.50Future success depends on the ability to learn.

However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called "Bollywood." Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a "masala" film. ("Masala" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much!'], [277, 'The pupils of the remote Beau-Roc primary school in Haiti are chanting (singing the same words again and again).One of them plays a guitar made from an empty oil tin.Their headmistress, Emile Jean-Noel, is one of the few women school headteachers in the country.Today, over 70% of Haitian population live without proper food, water, schools, or housing. To reduce the hunger that prevents learning and to encourage parents to send their children to school, meals are provided by the World Food Programme."We are so cut off that we have many difficulties," comments Emile, adding that finding chalk, school books and other materials is practically impossible.Emile tries to encourage people around her to make use of available resources.Her efforts are bearing fruit.One of her successes was convincing local women to contribute to their children\' s schooling and increase their income by selling embroidery  and other handicrafts.Recent political instability has meant that the country has not invested   in education for ten years.Only 44% of children go to school and less than half of them finish primary school.

Tradition has it that Leonardo Da Vinci worked for ten years upon the painting, the monks in the church annoyed at the delay. It was said that Leonardo often painted continuously from dawn to night without eating his meals. But at other times he spent hours before the picture, lost in contemplation, examining, comparing, and measuring his figures.This inactivity aroused the anger of the fussy Prior, the head of the church, who belonged to the large group of those who believed that the busier a man seems, the more he accomplishes; and so he tried to find fault with the idle  painter. Leonardo was slightly unhappy and explained to somebody else that there is a great difference between the work of the creative artist and the stonemason . The creative artist needs time for contemplation; he may be busiest when his hands are idlest. Just now he needed two heads to complete the picture: that of Christ, for which no model on earth could be found, for where was the man to be found whose face would express the strength, and beauty, and tenderness, and deep sorrow of the Christ; then he also needed a head of Judas, and that was hard to find as well, for where was the man whose face could express the meanness of that base traitor .

Do you wear fine clothes? Do you look rich? If so, be careful. There is a pickpocket looking for you. World travelers, away from home and usually carrying much money, are often troubled by pickpockets in foreign countries, but they should remember that there are pickpockets in their own country, too.              A typical pickpocket is under forty years of age, usually a male. He has nimble fingers and has trained himself in running. Generally, he carries a newspaper or magazine in his hand. He may appear fairly clever and pretend to be calm. He has learned his job from another pickpocket, and he repays his "teacher" by giving him a percentage of the money or things which he steals.              The skilled pickpocket always operates in crowded places. Very well-dressed men and slightly drunken men are the favorite objects of the pickpocket.              An average-sized department store hires about six or seven full-time detectives. These men and women are constantly looking for pickpockets quickly. But a good pickpocket knows these things and is very careful. He is especially busy on buses, trains and subways between 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. when there are many shoppers with much money to spend. He carefully remembers the payday and bonus times of companies.              Pickpocketing and stealing from a shop together represent about 75% of daytime little crimes in America. The sentence for these crimes is usually from three to five years in prison. After finishing their sentence, pickpockets and thieves seldom reform; they usually advance to more serious crimes.'], [317, 'The majority of physicists once believed that the universe\'s expansion was slowing down. In 1998, they were proven completely wrong. Though it flies in the face of scientific theory, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. One possible explanation is that empty space has a thing called dark energy, which supposedly makes up about three quarters of the universe. Dark energy supposedly very sparsely  exists in such a way that it interacts with other objects only through attracting force. It has a strong negative pressure, which causes it to pull on its surroundings and as a result, pull apart the universe. This neatly explains the universe\'s expansion without completely changing our understanding of the universe. Scientists can merely claim that dark energy "should" exist. According to Einstein\'s theory of relativity, it is impossible to travel faster than at the speed of light. With this in mind, physicists set out to do the impossible and succeeded. In 2000, scientists in Princeton, New Jersey sent a small pulse  of laser light through a vapor made up of gaseous cesium . The pulse traveled so quickly that it was already leaving the vapor-filled chamber as it was still entering, roughly 300 times faster than it would have in a vacuum . Thus, light moved faster than the speed of light. Other experiments have since managed to conquer light\'s supposed speed limit, though all claims have had fine print that keeps them from being especially groundbreaking . Those seeking to truly prove Einstein wrong must instead turn to objects like black holes, which could theoretically cause things to move at faster-than-light speeds. Black holes have been proven to be particularly uncooperative test subjects though, and for now this remains a guess.'], [320, 'The film "Avatar" has received great popularity around the world. It turned out to be a great success. The film got $1 billion in ticket sales in a very short time. The story in the film happens on an alien planet called Pandora where many strange species live. Among the planet\'s inhabitants(,),the one that has the most similarities with humans is the Na\'vi, and it is the struggle between the Ma\'vi and human invaders  that forms the story of the film.As to the factors  leading to the film\'s success, many think that the entertaining feast  for the eyes and the wonderful story shouldn\'t be forgotten, but the new language invented especially for the film which provides audiences with a new experience also plays an important part.In order to increase the truthfulness of an alien race , the film\'s director James Cameron asked an expert in languages from the University of Southern California to invent a language for the Na\'vi. Professor Paul Frommer combined the languages spoken among Indians, Africans and mid-Asians and worked with James Caneron for four years to create the Na\'vi language based on the original 30 words that the director had already come up with.According to Professor Frommer, the most important characteristic of the Na\'vi language is that it could be pronounced. "This is an alien language but obviously it has to be spoken by human actors and actresses," Professor Frommer told the BBC, "it has to sound natural and it should make human beings comfortable when using it."The language has a vocabulary of around 1000 words but Professor Formmer hopes to enlarge the vocabulary in possible follow-ups to the film and in video games. The professor hopes that one day his creation will be as successful as the Klingon alien language from the "Star Trek"films. "There\'s a translation of Hamlet into Klingon and it has received great popularity among the audiences," says Professor Frommer,"if anything like this happens to the Na\'vi language, I\'d be very happy."'], [325, "Today, many people are too busy to spend enough time with their family. What are the causes of this phenomenon and what problems has it brought to families and society as a whole?In this day and age, the human society is progressing rapidly on various aspects. Many modern technologies were invented by human such as cars, computers and Internet. But advances in technology lead to our pace of life much faster than before. People have not enough time with their family.It is evident that the causes of this phenomenon are different. In the first place, advancing in technology improves the efficiency of production, but also causes people to do more things at the same time. Moreover, this is especially true when we consider the fact that the global financial crisis in recent years has led many people to fear losing their job, and the significant rising costs of life which need people to work harder than before. Besides, employees may be scattered at the whole world. For example, my friend often holds a meeting at middle-night with his colleague who stays in the US and he still needs to work at daytime.In my opinion, the impact of this phenomenon on families and society is profound. People do not have enough time to spend with their family, especially with their children. They may spend much time in front of TV or computer games which have much violence and may seriously influence children's growth. Furthermore, the increasingly over-speed lifestyle will engender a higher incidence of illness. More instances about employee's sudden death at his/her workplace are reported by media and we must make reflection.In brief, I pen down saying that people should spend more time with their family because families are the foundation of the society.

The idea is to encourage healthy eating to fight the country\'s increasing obesity rate. It\'s feared that basic cooking and food preparation skills are being lost as parents turn to pre-pre-pared convenience foods.Cooking was once regarded as an important part of education in England-even if it was mainly aimed at girls. In recent decades cooking has progressively become a minor activity in schools. In  many cases the schools themselves have given up cooking meals in kitchens in the schools .But the rising level of obesity has led to a rethink about the food that children are given and the skills they should be taught."What I want is to teach young people how to do basic, simple recipes like a tomato sauce, a bolognaise, a simple curry, a stir-fry-which they can use now at home and then in their later life", said Ed Balls, the minister responsible for schools.The new lessons are due to start in September, but some schools without kitchens will be given longer to adapt. There is also likely to be a shortage of teachers with the right skills, since the trend has been to teach food technology rather than practical cooking. Also the compulsory lessons for hands on cooking will only be one hour a week for one term. But the well-known cookery writer, Pru  Leith, believes it will be worth it ."If we\'d done this thirty years ago we might not have the crisis we\'ve got now about obesity and lack of knowledge about food and so on. Every child should know how to cook, not just so that they\'ll be healthy, but because it\'s a life skill which is a real pleasure".The renewed interest in cooking is primarily a response to the level of obesity in Britain which is among the highest in Europe, and according to government figures half of all Britains will be obese in 25 years if current trends are not stopped.'], [341, "The World Trade Organization (WTO) founded on January 1, 1994, aims to encourage international trade to flow as freely as possible, making sure that trade agreements are respected and that any disputes   can be settled.In the five years since its founding, the WTO has become well-known as one of the world's most powerful economic organizations, taking its place alongside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.The system of global rules for international trade, however, dates back half a century to 1948 when the General Agreement on Tariffs   and Trade (GATT) was formed after World War II.As time went by it became clear that the GATT had two major _ --the limited areas of trade it covered, and the lack of an effective system to settle disputes.After seven years of trade talks ending in 1994. the so-called Uruguay Round finally gave birth to the WTO, complete with an effective system to settle disputes and new rules covering trade in services and intellectual property  .Even after seven years of talks and 22500 pages of agreements there were still problems, especially the difficult-to-deal-with areas of agriculture and services.The WTO. with its head office in Geneva, has 135 members with 30 more waiting to join."], [344, "A  At a recent visit to the beautiful Keukenhof flower gardens in Holland, I learned about the practice of topping.As flowers grow, sometimes the growers cut off the tops of the flowers, which they believe causes the plants to invest more energy into flower growth and less into seed production.The expected result is flower buds that will produce higher quality flowers.This is the same with personal growth.Sometimes when we produce first results in a certain area, it can be helpful to cut them off and throw them away.This can free up energy for a stronger attempt elsewhere instead of settling into the comfort zone of satisfaction with the old results.After running my computer games business for 10 years and getting satisfying results with it, I decided to drop it and leave that field behind.This freed up my energy to focus on my personal development writing and speaking.If I'd kept running the old business, this would have meant less energy to invest in my new path.It can be difficult to choose the topping approach because you're taking something that's already reasonably satisfying and cutting it out of your life, in the hopes that something even better will grow in its place.Do you want to settle where you are right now? If so, then topping is unnecessary.But if you'd like to do better and believe you have a good shot at improvement, just like the flower growers at Keukenhof, then topping is a sensible practice.To free up time and energy for future growth in new directions, you have to drop the merely satisfactory.This gives you a shot at the truly beautiful.Stepping outside of your comfort zone is by definition an uncomfortable experience, but it can result in a lot more growth than staying put.Though dropping satisfaction to go for more growth is not an easy path to follow, I do find it to be the more beautiful path."], [348, 'The United States estimates that about one out of every 10 people on the planet today is at least 60 years old. By 2050, it\'s projected to be one out of 5. This means that not only will there be more old people, but there will be relatively fewer young people to support them.Professor Richard Lee of the University of California at Berkeley says this aging of the world has a great effect on economics. "Population aging increases the concentration of population in the older ages and therefore it is costly," he said.Aging populations consume   more and produce less. With more people living longer, it could get expensive. But Mr. Lee says with continuing increases in worker productivity and smart planning, it can be manageable.Societies have different methods for caring for the elderly, but each carries a cost. Generally, there are three types of support. Seniors can live off the wealth they gained when they were younger. They can rely on their family to take care of them, or they can rely on the government.In industrialized nations, governments created publicly-funded   support systems. These worked relatively well until recent years, when aging population growth in places like the United States and Western Europe began to gradually weaken the systems finances. These nations now face some tough choices. Mr. Lee says the elderly in some of these countries must either receive less money, retire later or increase taxes to make the system continuable.Most developing nations haven\'t built this type of government-funded support, but have instead relied on families to care for their elderly. These nations also generally have a much younger population, which means their situation is not as urgent as more developed nations. But Mr. Lee says that doesn\'t mean they can ignore the issue. "Third World countries should give very careful thought to this process, to population aging and how it may affect their economies -- now, before population aging even becomes an issue," he explained.'], [352, 'I am 26.

This means that they were built higher in the middle than on the edges, allowing rainwater to run off, which prevented flooding. We use the same technique in building roads today. The Romans also laid out roads over hills when necessary, setting them down in a zigzag pattern to make the road rise gradually.All Roman roads had milestones  , placed every thousands paces (a Roman mile). The milestones told when the road was built, who was emperor at the time, the road\'s destination, how far the traveler was from the destination, and how many miles had been traveled since the beginning of the road.

In the fifteenth century, a greenhorn was a young cow or ox whose horns had not yet developed. A century or so later, a greenhorn was a soldier who had not yet had any experience in war  . By the eighteenth century, a greenhorn had the meaning it has today--a person who is new in a job.About one hundred years ago, greenhorn was a popular expression in the American west. Old-timers used it to describe a man who had just arrived from one of the big cities in the east. The greenhorn didn't have the skills that he would need to live in the hard, rough country.Someone who has the ability to grow plants well is said to have a green thumb. The expression comes from the early nineteen hundreds.A person with a green thumb seems to have a magic touch that makes plants grow quickly and well. You might say that the woman next door has a green thumb if her garden continues to grow long after your plants have died.The Green Revolution   is the name which was given some years ago to the development of new kinds of rice and other grains.

Later on,when they asked railway officials to take them up to look at the High Line,they saw a mile and a half of wild flowers growing in the middle of the city,and they realized that the High Line had potential to become a park.There was growing interest in improving urban centers,and so the project quickly gathered funds for construction.The first section of the High Line opened in 2009 and immediately became popular with tourists and locals alike.Each part of the park has a different atmosphere.Some areas are like balconies with wonderful city views.Other sections have wide lawns and walkways planted with wild flowers.Only the final section remains the way it has been for the last fifty years--a railway line overgrown with weeds.'], [420, 'One of Scotland\'s most active centenarians ( ), Lady Morton, drove for nearly 80 years.

Our own planet, Earth, is becoming more and more crowed and polluted. Luckily, we can start again and build a better world on Mars. Here is what life could be like.First of all, transport should be much better. At present, our spaceships are too slow to carry large numbers of people to Mars -- it takes months. However, by 2100, spaceship can travel at half the speed of light. It might take us two or three days to get to Mars!Secondly, humans need food, water and air to live. Scientists should be able to develop plants that can be grown on Mars. These plants will produce the food and air that we need. However, can these plants produce water for us ? There is no answer now.There is a problem for us to live on Mars. Mars pulls us much less than the Earth does. This will be dangerous because we could easily jump too high and fly slowly away into space. To prevent this, humans on Mars have to wear special shoes to make themselves heavier.Life on Mars will be better than that on Earth in many ways, People will have more space.

And chances are that you\'ll have traveled through a wind shield  or door to do it. Studies show that chances of dying after a car accident are twenty-five times greater in cases where people are "thrown clear".Myth Number Two: Safety belts "trap" people in cars that are burning or sinking in water.Truth: Sorry again, but studies show that people knocked unconscious  due to not wearing safety belts have a greater chance of dying in these accidents. People wearing safety belts are usually protected to the point of having a clear head to free themselves from such dangerous situations, not to be trapped in them.Myth Number Three: Safety belts aren\'t needed at speeds of less than 30 miles per hour.Truth: When two cars traveling at 30 mph hit each other, an unbelted driver would meet the windshield with a force equal to diving headfirst into the ground from a height of 10 meters.'], [454, 'When I was in my fourth year of teaching, I was also (and am still) a high school track and field coach  .

Partly it\'s a question of hygiene. And it\'s a matter of degree. Making up --- a private act--- has a way of neglecting the presence of others.

Deploring the practice as a waste of company time, trade journals advises managers to discourage it among workers. Peiss theorizes that it was female\'s making up in what has been an all-male field that disturb some gentlemen.Peiss tells me that after the 30\'s , pulling out a make-up case was no longer an issue. It became an accepted practice. I asked if she feels free to apply lipstick at a professional lunch herself. Sounding mildly shocked, she says she would save that for the privacy of her car afterward. Why? Because it would be "a gesture of inappropriate feminity ."

Instead of freeing his wife and getting her to shore, Graham grabbed Rosie, their pet dog. With Rosie safe and sound, Graham returned for Sheryl. All are doing fine.  It's a great story, but it doesn't strike me as especially newsworthy. News is supposed to be about something fairly unique, and recent research suggests that, in the right circumstances, lots of people also would have grabbed their Rosie first.  We have strange relationships with our pets. We look after our pets with great love and better health care than billions of people receive. We speak to pets with the same high-pitched voices that we use for babies. As an extreme example of our feelings about pets, the Nazis had strict laws that guaranteed the kind treatment of the pets of Jews being shipped to death camps.  A recent paper by George Regents University demonstrates this human involvement with pets to an astonishing extent. Participants in the study were told a situation in which a bus is out of control, bearing down on a dog and a human. Which do you save? With responses from more than 500 people, the answer was that it depended: What kind of human and what kind of dog? Everyone would save a brother, grandparent or close friend rather than a strange dog. But when people considered their own dog VS people less connected with them--a distant cousin or a hometown stranger--votes in favor of saving the dog came rolling in. And an astonishing 40% of respondents, including 46% of women, voted to save their dog over a foreign tourist.   What does a finding like this mean? First, that your odds aren't so good if you find yourself in another country with a bus bearing down on you and a cute dog. But it also points to something deeper: our unprecedented  attitude toward animals, which got its start with the birth of kind-hearted societies in the 19th century.  We prison people who abuse animals, put ourselves in harm's way in boats between whales and whalers and show sympathy to Bambi and his mother. We can extend sympathy to an animal and feel its pain like no other species. But let's not be too proud of ourselves. As this study and too much of our history show, we're pretty selective about how we extend our kindness to other human beings."], [464, "This sense of total discomfort that you're both feeling is pretty normal.

And indeed,  cutting fat  to control or lose weight makes sense. Fat has nine calories per gram. Protein and carbohydrates  have just four. Moreover, the body uses fewer calories to metabolize fat than it does to metabolize other foods. Compared with protein and carbohydrates -- which break down into amino acids and simple sugars, respectively, and can be used to strengthen and energize the body ---- dietary fat is more easily converted to body fat. Therefore, it\'s more likely to stay on buttocks, thighs and bellies.But cutting fat from your diet doesn\'t necessarily mean your body won\'t store fat. For example, between nonfat and regular cookies, there\'s trivial difference in calories because manufacturers make up for the loss of fat by adding sugar. Low-fat crackers, soups and dressings can also be just as high in calories as richer versions. No matter where the calories come from, overeating will still cause weight again. The calories from fat just do it a little quicker. A Wisconsin computer programmer who decided with a diet coach to eat only 40 grams of fat a day learned the lesson firsthand. He wasn\'t losing weight. Then he showed his food diary to his coach and revealed he\'d been eating half a pound of jelly beans a day. "They don\'t have any fat," he explains. But they had enough sugar to keep him from shedding an ounce. Nonfat foods become add-on foods. When we add them to our diet, we actually increase the number of calories we eat per day and gain weight. That was borne out in a Pennsylvania State University study. For breakfast, Prof. Barbara Rolls gave two groups of women yogurt that contained exactly the same amount of calories. One group\'s yogurt label said "high fat"--the other, "low fat." The "low fat" yogurt group ate significantly more calories later in the day than the other group. "People think they\'ve saved fat and can indulge themselves later in the day with no adverse consequences," says Richard Mattes, a nutrition researcher at Purdue University.

The donkeys worked hard every day. They had  no time to play or to relax, but they never felt appreciated for the work they did.One day two donkeys got bored. They wanted to live a comfortable life. So the donkeys went  to see a wise old man. They told him their problem. The wise old man agreed that they worked too hard, and he wanted to help the donkeys. "I have an idea." he said."What is your idea?" asked the donkeys."I will paint you and no one will know you are donkeys," said the man.The man went off to find some paint and he returned in just a matter of minutes. He had two  pots of paint. One pot was filled with white paint, and the other black paint.The old man first painted them white,  and  then  painted  black  stripes  over the  white  paint.  When he finished, the donkeys did not look at all like donkeys.  "You no longer look like  donkeys, "  the old man said.   " Everyone will be fooled.  I will call you something else,  zebras.

When the \' zebras told the donkeys their secret, the donkeys all rushed to see the old man."Make us into zebras, too," they pleaded. So the wise old man painted more donkeys. As  he did, more and more donkeys came.The old man could not paint fast enough. Soon the donkeys became impatient.

Bees are known as very hard workers. They appear to be busy, moving around their homes, or hives  . So you might say you were as busy as a bee if you spent your weekend cleaning your house. In fact, you might say your house was a beehive of activity if your whole family was helping you clean. You also might say you made a beeline for something if you went there right away. When we go to see a movie, my friend always makes a beeline for the place where they sell popcorn   .Here is an expression about bees that is not used much any more, but we like it anyway. We think it was first used in the 1920s. If something was the best of its kind, you might say it was the bee\'s knees. Now, we admit that we do not know how this expression developed. In fact, we do not even know if bees have knees!If your friend cannot stop talking about something because she thinks it is important, you might say she has a bee in her bonnet  . If  someone asks you a personal question, you might say "that is none of your beeswax". This means none of your business.Speaking of personal questions, there is an expression when their children ask, "Where do babies come from?" Parents who discuss sex and reproduction   say this is talking about the birds and bees.Butterflies are beautiful insects, but you would not want to have butterflies in your stomach. That means to be nervous about having to do something, like speaking in front of a crowd. You would also not want to have ants in your trousers. That is, to be unable to sit still.'], [489, 'An idea that started in Seattle\'s public library has spread throughout America and beyond.The concept is simple: help to build a sense of community in a city by getting everyone to read the same book at the same time.In addition to encouraging reading as a pursuit   to be enjoyed by all, the program allows strangers to communicate by discussing the book on the bus, as well as promoting reading as an experience to be shared in families and schools.The idea came from Seattle librarian Nancy Pearl who launched  the "If All of Seattle Read the Same Book " project in 1998.Her original program used author visits, study guides and book discussion groups to bring people together with a book, but the idea has since expanded to many other American cities, and even to Hong Kong.In Chicago, the mayor appeared on television to announce the choice of To Kill a Mockingbird as the first book in the "One Book, One Chicago" program.As a result, reading clubs and neighborhood groups sprang up around the city.Across the US, stories emerged of parents and children reading to each other at night and strangers chatting away on the bus about plot and character.The only problem arose in New York, where local readers could not decide on one book to represent the huge and diverse population. This may show that the idea works best in medium-sized cities or large towns, where a greater sense of unity can be achieved. Or it may show that New Yorkers rather missed the point, putting all their energy and passion into the choice of the book rather than discussion about a book itself.Ultinatelas Nancy points out, the level of success is not measured by how many people read a book, but by how many people are enriched by the process, or have enjoyed speaking to someone with whom they would not otherwise have shared a word.'], [493, 'Are you stuck in a rut and looking for a change? Fed up of seeing hungry, poor faces on your TV screen and want to do something to help? Perhaps you\'ve considered volunteering overseas but ruled it out because you thought you were too old, couldn\'t commit enough time, or have a family. If so, think again."Over the past five years it has become far safer --- and more professionally acceptable --- to take up a job volunteering overseas," says David Stitt, managing director of Gap Year for Grown Ups, a company catering for volunteers in their late 20s and upwards. "While 10 years ago _ took financial and personal risks in volunteering abroad, now several organizations exist to make the experience safe and well-organized.Nowadays, universities and business encourage overseas volunteering among students and employees. Entire families can volunteer abroad, and agencies are employing more disabled and retired people. A prosperous "humanitarian tourism" industry has sprung up; thousands of UK citizens will do some form of overseas volunteering this year."Some volunteering jobs are easier to find than others," explains Kevin Cusack, from a volunteer advice agency. "If you can speak English, it\'s not too hard to land a job teaching English, even without a qualification, and those who enjoy working with children should be able to find child care work." zxxkWhether your interest is rainforests or women\'s rights, you can find a volunteer position to suit you. But be warned: unless you have relevant skills or existing overseas development experience, it\'s going to cost. Just how much depends on the location and length of the position, but you should budget for somewhere between PS1,500 and PS6,000."Having to pay to volunteer may sound paradoxical  , but it\'s the best way to ensure you get a position that benefits the local community while matching your interests and skills," explains Cusack.  "You can also discuss the time you want to commit to a project --- many positions can fit into a holiday or even a weekend."'], [497, "The size of the British Isles often leads people to think that the languages spoken in its countries of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are somewhat the same. At first, visitors are often surprised to find that they have difficulty in understanding the accents and dialects of certain regions. Even in England there are many different dialects.Experts believe that for most English people, the places they come from are very important to them. Accents are clues to where people were born and where they grew up. Although some people may change the way they speak during their lifetime, most people carry at least some evidence of their accents and dialects throughout their lives. In addition to the regional accents of England, there can also be class differences among the accents. People are often able to make instant and unconscious judgments about a stranger's class by listening to his or her accent. Both the words and the pronunciation of an individual reflect his or her social position.It is agreed that in England, the kind of English spoken by a person plays a leading role that generally is not important in North America. The importance of accents and their cultural and social relationships are well represented in films and on television in Britain. The film My Fair Lady based on George Bernard Shaw's 1912 play Pygmalion is often said to be a wonderful example of how social class and the accent were, and still are, linked in Britain."]]

A housekeeper arrived and declared the spill a small one."It\'s not my responsibility,"said the nurse,"because it\'s a large puddle  ."The housekeeper didn\'t agree."The angry patient listened for a time, then took a pitcher of water from his night table and poured the whole thing on the floor.So, responsibility is about our ability to respond to circumstances and to choose the attitudes, actions and reactions that shape our lives. The grand sight of the potential of our lives can only be appreciated when we begin to be accountable and independent. If you want more control over your life and the pleasures, power of freedom and independence, all you have to do is be responsible.
