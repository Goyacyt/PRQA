Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season.

However, they faced difficulties due to multiple modifications and injuries to the offensive line. Additionally, Manning experienced his least successful season in terms of statistics since his rookie year in 1998 with the Indianapolis Colts.

From that point onwards, Osweiler took over as the starting quarterback for the majority of the remaining regular season..During the Week 17 regular season finale, Osweiler suffered an injury which led to Manning's return. At that time, the Broncos were trailing 13-7 against the San Diego Chargers, who had a record of 4-11. Manning stepped in and managed to lead the team to a crucial 27-20 victory.

Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Broncos' defense ranked number one in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team has continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.", "modContext": "After the Denver Broncos suffered a defeat in the divisional round of the playoffs last season, they made several adjustments to their coaching staff. This included parting ways with head coach John Fox, who had achieved four divisional championships during his four-year tenure with the Broncos. In his place, the team hired Gary Kubiak as the new head coach..During Kubiak's tenure, the Broncos intended to implement a run-focused offense that incorporated zone blocking to complement quarterback Peyton Manning's expertise in shotgun passing. However, they faced difficulties due to multiple modifications and injuries to the offensive line. Additionally, Manning experienced his least successful season in terms of statistics since his rookie year in 1998 with the Indianapolis Colts. This decline was partly attributed to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had been dealing with since the summer and the natural aging process, as Manning turned 39 during the 2015 off-season..Despite the team's impressive 7-0 start, Manning topped the NFL in interceptions..Manning's left foot experienced a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in week 10..In this game, he achieved the remarkable feat of setting the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards. However, his performance took a downturn when he threw four interceptions, leading to his replacement by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler. From that point onwards, Osweiler took over as the starting quarterback for the majority of the remaining regular season..During the Week 17 regular season finale, Osweiler suffered an injury which led to Manning's return. At that time, the Broncos were trailing 13-7 against the San Diego Chargers, who had a record of 4-11. Manning stepped in and managed to lead the team to a crucial 27-20 victory. This win allowed the Broncos to secure the number one overall AFC seed and ensured Manning's reclamation of the starting quarterback position for the playoffs..With Wade Phillips as the defensive coordinator, the Broncos' defense excelled in various aspects including total yards allowed, passing yards allowed, and sacks, ranking them number one. Furthermore, the team has consistently established numerous individual, league, and franchise records for the past three seasons..Despite the offensive struggles, the Broncos relied on their strong defense to carry the team throughout the regular season.
